幸福课 中英字幕 [第1课]什么是积极心理学？

各位 早上好
Hi Good morning.
很高兴能回到这里
It's wonderful to be back here.
很高兴见到你们
Wonderful to see you here.
我教授这门课是因为
I'm teaching this class
在我读本科阶段时
because I wish a class like this had been taught
非常希望能学习这样一门课程
when I was sitting in your seat as an undergrad here.
可能这门课并不是你希望的那样
This does not mean it is a class you wish to be taught,
也可能并不适合你
nor does it mean that it is the right class for you.
但希望几堂课后 你能有个大概印象
But I hope to doing the next couple of lectures is giving you an idea what this class is about
让你决定这门课是否适合你
so that you can decide whether or not it is for you.
我1992年来到哈佛求学
I came here in 
大二期间 突然顿悟了
And then I had a mini epiphany half way through my sophomore year.
我意识到我身处让人神往大学校园
I realized that I was in a wonderful place
周围都是出色的同学 优秀的导师
with wonderful students around me, wonderful teachers.
我成绩优异
I was doing well academically.
擅长体育运动
I was doing well in athletics.
70:01:19,830 --&gt; 00:01:22,670
我当时在校队打壁球
i was playing varsity squash at the time.
社交也游刃有余
I was doing well socially.
一切都很顺利
Everything was going well.
除了一点
Except for the fact.
我不快乐
That I was unhappy.
而且我不明白为什么
And I didn't understand why.
也就是在那时
It was then in a matter of moments,
我决定要找出原因 变得快乐
that I decided that I had to find out why and become happier.
于是我将研究方向
And that was when I switched my concentration
从计算机科学转向了哲学及心理系
from computer science to philosophy and psychology
目标只有一个
with a single question:
如何变得更快乐?
how can I become happier?
渐渐地 我的确变得更快乐了
Over time I did become happier.
主要因为我接触了一个新的领域
What contributed most to my happiness was when I encountered a new emerging field
那时并未正式命名
that at that time didn't have the name that it has today.
但本质上属于积极心理学范畴
But essentially research that falls under or within the field of positive psychology.
研究积极心理学
Positive psychology, studying it,
把其理念应用到生活中 让我无比快乐
applying the ideas to my life has made me significantly happier.
而且这种快乐继续着
It continues to make me happier.
于是我决定将其与更多的人分享
And it was when I realized the impact that it had on me that I decided to share it with others.
选择教授这门学科
That's when I decided that I wanted to be a teacher and teach in this field.
这就是积极心理学
So this is positive psychology,
9504号心理学课程
psychology 1504.
我们将一起探索这一全新
And we'll be exploring this new,
相对新兴 令人倾倒的领域
relatively new and fascinating field.
希望同时还能探索我们自己
And hopefully, we will be exploring more than the field ourselves.
我第一次开设这门课程 是在2002年
When I first taught this class that was back in 2002,
是以讨论会的形式 只有8名学生
I taught it at a seminar and had eight students.
两名退出了
Two dropped out.
只剩我和其他六个人
That left me with six.
一年后
The year after,
学生稍微多了一点
the class became slightly larger.
有300多人参加
I had over three hundred students.
到了第三年 也就是上一次开课
And then third year when I taught it which was the last time,
有850人参加
I had 850 students in the class,
是当时哈佛人数最多的课程
making it at that point the largest course at Harvard.
这引起了媒体的关注
And that's when the media became interested.
因为他们想知道为什么
Because they wanted to understand why.
他们对这一奇特现象非常好奇
They wanted to understand this phenomenon that "here you have a class,
"竟然有比经济学导论更热门的课程
that's larger than Introduction to Economics".
怎么可能呢?"
How could that be?
于是我被请去参加各类媒体采访
So I was invited by the media for interviews,
报纸 广播 电视
whether it was newspapers, radio, television.
从这些采访中 我发现了一种有趣的模式
And I started to notice a pattern during those interviews.
我前去参加采访
So I would walk into the interview.
进行采访
We would have the interview.
结束后 制片人或主持人会送我出来
And afterwards, the producer or the interviewer would walk me out
说些诸如"Tal 多谢你抽空参加采访
and say something to the effects of "well thank you Tal for the interview.
"不过你跟我想象的不太一样"的话
But you know I expected you to be different".
我漫不经心地问
And I would ask, as nonchalant as I could of course.
我无所谓 不过总得回应
I didn't really care but had to ask anyway,
"有何不同?" 他们会说
"how different?" And they would say,
"这个嘛 我们以为你很外向"
"Well you know, we expected you to be more outgoing."
下一次采访 结束时仍是如此
Next interview, the end of the interview, same thing.
"多谢接受采访
"Thank you for doing the interview.
"不过Tal 你跟我想象得不太一样"
But you know Tal, I expected you to be different."
又一次 我漫不经心地问
And once again, nonchalant of course.
"有何不同?"
would ask"how different?"
她说
And she would say,
"这个嘛 我们没想到你会这么内向"
"Well you know, we expected you to be less, less itrovert."
下一次采访 仍是如此
Next interview, same thing.
"有何不同?"
"How different?"
"这个嘛 更开朗 更外向"
"Well, you know, more extroverted. More outgoing."
下一次采访 "这个嘛 太害羞了"
Next interview. "Well, you know, less shy."
因为采访中我容易紧张
Coz I get very nervous in interviews.
差不多有几十次采访
Interview after interview, literally dozens.
每次都是"好交际 更开朗"
More outgoing, more cheerful.
"不含蓄 更外向"
Less introverted, more extroverted.
诸如此类
And on and on.
最绝的一次
But here is the best one.
是波士顿一家地方台
So this is one of the local channels here around Boston.
我去参加采访
I was going to the interview.
聊了很多
We had a quite long interview,
我觉得进行得不错
which I thought was actually pretty good.
采访结束
And at the end of the interview,
主持人是个热情开朗的男生
the interviewer is a very jolly guy.
他送我出门 拍着我的肩说
He walks me out and puts his hands on my shoulder,
"多谢接受我们采访"
and says, "thank you very much for doing the interview."
然后又是那句
And then the usual comes.
"不过 Tal 你跟我想象得不太一样"
"But you know Tal, I expected you to be different."
我问
And I said,
"有何不同" 你要知道
"How different?" Just so you understand,
那时候 我已经完全被打击了
by this time, my self-esteem is short.
不过我还是漫不经心地问
But still with some resemblance of nonchalance I asked,
"有何不同?"
"how different?"
他看着我说
And he looks at me and says,
"我也说不上 Tal 我以为你会更高些"
"Well I don't know Tal. I expected you to be taller."
更高些?什么?
Taller? What?
05米70...是1米69不够格传授快乐吗
Five seven, well ok five six and a half is not enough to teach happiness?
我考虑了很久 仔细思量了
And I thought about it. I thought about it a lot.
整件事从头到尾
The whole pattern from the beginning.
我似乎明白为什么他们期望不同了
And I think I understand why they expected someone different.
因为他们要说服自己 说服观众
You see they had to explain to themselves as well as the audience,
"这门课怎么会比经济学导论更热门?"
"how come this lecture is larger than the Introduction to Economics?"
唯一的解释就是
And the way to explain it must be that
导师非常外向
the teacher is very outgoing,
充满领袖气质
extremely charismatic,
乐观开朗 当然了 还很高
very cheerful and extrovert and of course, tall.
可惜我的名字少了一个L
Well, there is one L missing there.
但是
But...
是啊
Yeah.
真可惜
If only.
所以问题是
So the problem though is
他们找答案找错了地方
that they were looking in the wrong place for the explanation.
也就是说 他们不该关注信息传达者
In other words, they were looking at the messenger.
而应该关注信息本身
What they needed to look at was the message.
我怎么知道的呢
Now how do I know that?
因为我参与过其他大学积极心理学课
You see because I see other positive psychology classes on other campuses
遍及全国 乃至全球
around the country and around the world.
美国有超过200所大学开设了本课程
There are over 200 hundred campuses here in United States that teach positive psychology.
而且几乎其中所有院校 这门课
On almost every campus where this class is taught,
都是参与人数最多的或者最多的之一
it's either one of the or the largest class.
信息是关键
It's about the message.
越来越多的机构组织开设这门课
I see more and more organizations taking up positive psychology in their,
还有咨询公司
as consultant companies,
其中一些甚至是全球知名咨询公司
some of them the leading big consultant companies are taking it on.
越来越多的中学开始引入积极心理学
More and more high schools are introducing positive psychology class.
小学也是
Elementary schools are introducing it.
各国政府都对这一新领域表现出兴趣
The governments around the world are expressing interest in this new emerging field.
为什么?因为它有效
Why? Because it works.
它的的确确有效
Because it really works.
殷盛人生 快乐 幸福感这一整个领域
You see this whole realm on life flourishing,
在此之前一直被心理自助运动统治
on happiness, on well-being has been until recently dominated by the self-health movement.
心理自助运动带来了什么
What do we have in the self-health movement?
生动有趣
We have books that are very interesting,
通俗易懂的书籍
that are very accessible.
热情外向的宣讲者
We have speakers who are very outgoing,
颇具领袖气质 且身材高大
very charismatic and tall,
吸引大众参与他们的专题讨论讲座
attracting the masses into these workshops, seminars and lectures.
但是 有一个大大的转折
But, there is a very big "but" here.
其中许多书籍讨论都缺少实质内容
Many of these books, many of these workshops and seminars lack substance.
通常都言过其实 无法兑现
Very often, overpromising and under-delivering.
比如 快乐的五个关键
So these are five things you need to know to be happy.
成功领袖的三个要素
The three things to be the great leader.
51
成功 快乐 完美爱情的唯一秘诀
The one secret of success, happiness and a perfect love life.
夸大其词 效果甚微
Overpromising. Under-delivering.
再来说说学术界
On the other hand, we have academia.
学术界给我们带来了什么
What do we have in academia?
大量精确的实质内容
We have a lot of rigor, a lot of substance.
数据被一而再 再而三地反复分析
We have datas analyzed, reanalyzed and meta-analyzed.
行之有效的好东西
Things that actually work, good stuff.
但是 又有一个大大的转折
But, and there is also a very big "but" here.
很少有人会阅读专业学术期刊
Very few people read refereed academic journals.
想想看 这间教室之外有多少人
I mean Think about it: how many people outside this room of course
读过最近12期《个性与社会心理学》杂志?
have read the last twelve issues of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology?
大多数人甚至不知道那是什么东西
Most people don't even know what that means.
我博士班的主任估算过
The head of my PHD programs actually estimated the average academic journal article
学术期刊上的一篇论文平均只有7人阅读
is read by seven people.
这话...
You know...
其中还包括作者的母亲
And that includes the author's mother.
这话虽然是半开玩笑 但其实很可悲
So you know I say half in jest but it's actually really sad.
因为...作为学者 我觉得很可悲
Because...certainly sad for me, as an academic.
因为这些论文都非常精彩
Because these things are good.
非常重要
They are important.
能大有作为
These things make a difference,
甚至不仅仅是作为
can even make more of a difference.
但是对大众来说晦涩难懂
But not accessible to most people.
所以我们需要积极心理学
And this is where positive psychology comes in.
需要这门课程
And this is also where this class comes in.
积极心理学及本课程的宗旨非常明确
The explicit mandate of positive psychology as well as of this class
就是要在象牙塔及大众间构建桥梁
is to create a bridge between Ivory tower and mainstreet.
换句话说 就是要把严谨
In other words, it is to bring the rigor,
实质 经验基础
the substance, the empirical foundation,
学术科学
the science from academia
与自助或新纪元运动的通俗易懂相结合
and merge it with accessibility of the self-help or New Age movement.
充分发挥两者所长
In a way the best of both worlds.
这也是积极心理学大受欢迎的原因:
And this explains the popularity of the field of positive psychology:
有用的科学
science that works.
本课程将分为两个部分
This class will be taught on two levels.
第一部分会和其他心理学
The first level it will be taught as any other class in psychology
或者其他任何课程一样
or any of the classes you've taken here.
我将向你们介绍相关知识
You'll be introduced here to studies,
调查研究 严谨的学术作品
to research, to rigorous academic work.
需要你们撰写报告 学术论文
You'll be writing paper, academic paper.
参加考试
You'll be taking exams.
跟其他课程一样
Just like every other class.
而教学内容的另一部分
But then it will also be taught at the second level,
你们读每一篇论文
which is for every paper that you'll read,
写每一篇论文时
every paper that you'll write,
都需要思考
you'll always be thinking,
如何把这些理念运用到生活中去
"Ok, how can I take these ideas and apply them to my life?
运用到恋爱中去
How can I apply them to my relationship?
运用到社交圈里去
How can I apply them to my community?"
就是这两个部分
Two levels.
学术与应用
The academic. Applied.
无论是论文还是讲座 我不会因为
I did not just introduce whether it's in the readings or in the lectures ideas
某个理论有趣而去介绍它
just because they are interesting for the sake of the idea.
而是因为这个理论严谨且能被应用
It is always an idea that is both rigorous and can be applied.
再唠叨几句题外话
Just a few words about housekeeping.
有几个问题课前就有人问我了
Some of the questions that I have already received from you before the class started.
不幸的是这学期将是我最后一次
So this, unfortunately,
在哈佛开设积极心理学或其他课程
is the last time that I am teaching positive psychology or any other class for that matter at Harvard.
但愿两年内 明年可能性不大
Hopefully within two years, probably not next year,
但是两年内
but within two years,
学校会再次开设积极心理学课程
there will be positive psychology class offered,
但我无法保证
but I certainly cannot guarantee it.
关于反馈与提问
About feedback and questions.
如果你有任何问题或不明白的地方
If you have any questions, anything that's not clear,
如果你同意或反对什么观点
if you agree or disagree with something,
请给我或助教写邮件
email me or email your TF (Teaching Fellow at Harvard, just like TA at other schools)
我们一定会回复的
and we'll always respond.
如果某个问题问的人数较多
Sometimes if the question is asked by enough people,
我们会公开回答
we'll respond to it publicly.
当然一定是匿名的
Always anonymously.
除非你特别注明可以提及你的名字
Unless you specified specifically that your name can be mentioned.
有时候讲座过程中 突然有紧急情况
Sometimes you may be listening to a lecture and then half way through it there is an emergency.
有什么非问不可的问题
There is something that you really have to ask,
无法等待
something that cannot wait.
如果那样的话 请直接举手
In that case, please just put your hand up.
因为就跟你要去厕所一样
Coz it's just like when you have to go to the bathroom.
无法忍耐
Just can't stop.
无法等待
Can't wait.
要去
And when you gotta go,
就去
you gotta go.
我们会为此进行积极心理休息
So we'll take a positive psychology break for that.
所以大可以打断我 我会回答任何问题
And just stop me half way through and I'll answer any question.
所有幻灯片以及课程视频都会放在网上
All the power points, as well as the videos of the classes will be online.
课后几天就能下载
Will be available within couple of days.
幻灯片其实课前就能下载
Well the power points will be available before,
这样你上课时就能用到
say for this lecture it will be before so that you can use them in class.
可惜视频不能提前提供 我们试了
The videos, unfortunately, cannot be made available before. We tried.
但效果不好
Couldn't figure it out.
所以会在课后一两天内放到网上
So it will be available within a day or two after.
这样做的原因
And the reason why they are up there.
首先 我当然更希望你们出席课程
First of all, I do prefer that you attend lecture.
能出现在课堂里
I do prefer that you are physically here.
和大家一起 在课堂的气氛中学习
You get things in the energy of the room with so many students
而不是仅仅对着电脑
so you wouldn't just get from your computer.
我之所以把资料放在网上是为了
The reason why I do put them up is so that you have the opportunity
让你们可以重温或者学习错过的课程
if you want to see it again or if you have to miss a class.
这很正常
That's perfectly fine.
另一个原因
And also because,
之所以提前提供幻灯片
and this is also the reason why the power points are always available,
我希望你们能充分理解材料
I want you to be engaged in the material.
充分参与课堂讨论
I want you to be engaged in whatever it is that we are discussing in class.
而不是忙于记录我说的每一个字
Not necessarily thinking about getting down every word that I say on paper,
记住每一个词 背诵每一句话
remembering everything, memorizing everything.
我不希望你们被动地记录
I want you to take rather than passive notes of writing down
幻灯片上的内容或者我说的话
what is on the power point or every word that I say.
而是要主动记录
I'd like you to take active notes.
也就是要充分理解材料
And that means being engaged with the material.
比如 如果你们听到某个理论 觉得
For example, if you heard something and idea and you say,
"挺有趣的"
"Oh, that's interesting."
标上星号 写下来
Star it. Write it down.
或者觉得"也许我可以应用这点"
Or "Ok I think I'll start applying this."
那就写下来
Write it down.
或者"跟我妈妈讲讲"
"Or I want to tell my mom about this later."
或者"跟我室友队友讲讲"
Or "I want to talk to my roommates or my team about this idea."
那就写下来
Write it down.
主动笔记与被动笔记有两方面不同
Active note-taking is opposed to passive note-taking for two reasons.
首先 正如我刚才说的
First of all, as I said,
这门课是关于如何改变生活
this class is a class about making a difference in people's lives.
我不会仅为了学术之美而教授此课
I would not be teaching the class just for its academic beauty,
虽然这一领域的确有许多学术之美
although there is a lot of academic beauty in this field.
所以发现可以实际运用的 就写下来
So write down if you have an idea that you think you can apply.
第二个原因是 你会记住更多
The second reason why we should that is because you'll remember more.
主动参与 集中注意 更好地理解材料
Better attention, better understanding of the material if you are actively engaged,
而不是被动做笔记
as opposed to just taking down passive notes.
在这整个课程中
Throughout the class,
从下周开始
starting next week,
我们将进行我所说的
we'll take what I called,
"练习时间" 而不是"休息时间"
"time-ins" as opposed to "time-outs".
其实类似"休息时间"
it's like a time-out.
这段时间会我们停止课程 进行内省
It's the time where we stop the class and you look inward.
也就是课堂上的安静时刻
And this is literally a time of silence in a class.
我会停一两分钟
I will stop for a minute or two.
你们可以盯着我或者周围人发呆
And you'll have a chance either to just stare at me or anyone else,
或者思考一下之前讨论的内容
or think about what we've just discussed,
或者解答我提出的提示问题
or have a guiding question that I will provide you that you'll address during the class.
之所以进行"练习时间"
The reason why I have "Time-ins"...
这是今年新提出的
This is something that I am introducing this year for the first time.
上学期并没有
We didn't have it last time.
因为上次课程结束后到现在的两年
It's because over the last two years since I last taught it,
我做了大量关于安静的研究
I've done a lot work in the area of silence.
关于安静时刻的重要性 无论是课堂里
I've read a lot of research in this area about the importance of quiet times whether it's in a class,
讲座里 还是家中
in a lecture, whether it is at home,
无论是对公司领导
whether it is for a leader in the business,
爱情关系 甚至学龄前儿童
for relationship, for children starting from pre-schools.
你们中很多人
Now many of you,
在经历"练习时间"时可能会疑惑
as you are going through these "time-ins" if you decide to take this class may think,
"我一年付四万美金就是为了这个?"
"Well, is this what I'm paying 40,000 dollars a year for?
"坐在教室里发呆?"
To sit a class and be quiet?"
首先 每次只有一两分钟
First of all, it will only be a minute or two at a time,
一堂课最多不超过两次
maybe once or twice a lecture.
第二 这可能是
But second,
你从本课程中学到的最重要的东西
it is maybe the most important thing you'll take from this class.
即享受安静这一理念
The notion of embracing stillness.
我来读一段麻省理工两位教授的研究
Let me read to you an excerpt from a study that was run by two MIT professors.
我所提到名字不会出现在幻灯片上
By the way, all the names that I read and that are not on the power points,
不必背诵或记录
you don't need to remember or write down.
只是为了启发你们
This is just for your edification.
David Foster和Matthew Wilson教授
So David Foster and Matthew Wilson.
都来自麻省理工大学
Both of them are from MIT.
他们研究证实了"练习时间"的重要性
Indeed the following study that I think confirms the importance of "time-in",
开始内省的时间
time to look inside.
他们在老鼠处在迷宫中及脱离迷宫后
What they did is they scanned the brains of rats
分别对它们进行了脑扫描
while they were in a maze and after they went through the maze.
以下是他们的发现
And here's what they found.
实验结果表明 当某种经历正在进行时
"What the results suggest is that while there certainly is some record of your experience
即老鼠进行迷宫时
as it is occurring. in other words when they were doing the maze,
真正的学习阶段
the actual learning –
是当你尝试分辨
when you try to figure out:
什么才是重要的 什么舍弃什么保留
'What was important? What should I keep and throw away?'
这些发生在经历之后
– that happens after the fact,
进行安静的自省时
during periods of quiet wakeful introspection.
他们的实验表明
What they show was rats who went through the maze
接连不断反复进入迷宫的老鼠
and went through the maze again and again,
比进行一次迷宫后
learned far less than rats who took time aside,
稍事放松 来点小酒的老鼠
chilled out a little bit after a maze,
学到的少得多
had more margarita.
经历 享受安静
Experience, embrace stillness.
这很能说明问题 对人类也一样
This has implications and they showed implications to human beings as well.
不仅仅是实验小白鼠
Not only those of the rat race,
所有人类都是
all human beings.
他们认为"重现可能形成一种学习记忆机制"
So what they say is that "replay might constitute a general mechanism of learning and memory".
包括学习 理解
Both learning, understanding,
记忆 保留
as well as memory, retention.
当我们思考时 我们重放素材时
When we reflect, when we replay the material,
更容易保留
we are much more likely to retain,
记住之前的经历
to remember what we have just been through.
所以休息时间的重要性不能被忽视
So the importance of time aside cannot be over-emphasized.
Parker Palmer在他的教学著作
In his wonderful book of teaching,
《教学的勇气》一书中
Parker Palmer-- it's called The Courage to Teach,
提到了以下一段话
says the following--
语言不是教学的唯一媒介
Words are not the sole medium of exchange in teaching and learning.
安静同样可以进行教育
We educate with silence as well.
安静让我们有机会反省我们所说所闻
Silence gives us a chance to reflect on what we have said and heard.
在真正的教育中
In authentic education,
安静为学生进行内省提供可靠环境
silence is treated as a trustworthy matrix for the inner work students must do,
是一种最深层次的学习媒介
a medium for learning of the deepest sort."
而安静恰恰是我们文化所缺失的
Silence is something that is missing from our culture.
很多人可能读过《万里任禅游》
I know that many of you have probably read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,
作者Robert M Pirsig
Robert M. Pirsig.
还写过另一本书
He had a second book out,
没那么知名 叫《寻找莱拉》
less well-known, called Lila (Lila: an Inquiry into Morals).
这本书是对印第安人的人类学研究
And Lila is an anthropological study of Native Americans.
将他们的文化与美国传承的欧洲文化进行对比
What he does there is compare their culture to Americans' from European ancestry.
两种文化最突出的特点之一是
And one of the distinguishing characteristics between these two cultures
印第安人崇尚安静
is their approach were silence.
他发现和印第安人坐在一起
What he found was when he went and sat around with Native Americans.
他们围坐在篝火边两三个小时
They would sit around the fire and hang out for two,
一句话也没说
three hours without saying a word.
只是坐在那儿
Just sit around.
看着对方
Look at one another.
微笑 享受美好时光
Smile. Have a good time.
内省
Introspect.
就这样几个小时
Just be there for hours.
他指出 在我们文化中沉默
While he points out that in our culture we feel very uncomfortable with the absence of words,
让人不适
with the absence of sound or noise.
我们试图打破沉默
We have to fill up all the gaps.
这是一项重要的文化差异
This is an important cultural difference.
我们为缺乏安静付出了代价
And we pay a price for this lack of stillness.
我们会重点讨论这一代价
A price that we'll talk about a lot,
涉及到恋爱
when I talk about relationships,
美德与道德
when I talk about virtue and morality
以及快乐与幸福感
and when we talk about happiness and wellbeing in general.
下面介绍一下积极心理学的背景
Let me give a little bit background on positive psychology:
它是如何诞生的 这门课是如何诞生的
how we came about and how this class came about.
从很多方面来说 积极心理学是
In many ways, positive psychology is the brainchild,
人本主义心理学的产物和衍生
the product and the grandchild of humanistic psychology.
人本主义心理学本质上是
What we have in humanistic psychology is essentially a reaction
对当时各种心理学派系的不同意见
to the existing psychologies of the time.
人本主义心理学的创始人
The founders, considered the founders of humanistic psychology
称之为心理学上的"第三势力"
in fact called it "the third force".
为什么是"第三势力"
Why the "third force"?
因为第一势力是行为主义
Because the first force was behaviorism.
代表人物有斯金纳
The work of Skinner (B. F. Skinner),
华生
the work of Watson (John B. Watson),
桑代克
the work of Thorndik (Edward Thorndik).
这是第一势力
This was the first force.
第二势力是精神分析学
The second force was psychoanalysis.
创建者包括弗洛伊德 荣格以及阿德勒
The work of Freud (Sigmund Freud), Jung (Carl Jung), Adler (Alfred Adler) to some extent.
这是第二势力
This was the second force.
第三势力
And the third force,
人本主义心理学作为对其的异议出现
humanistic psychology came as a reaction to it.
首先是对行为主义的异议
First it is a reaction to behaviorism.
行为主义认为人的主体性
Behaviorism looks at the human entity,
认为人是一个行为集合
at the person as basically a collection of behaviors as a box,
就像一只被击打而四处滚动的台球
like a billiard ball knocked around by reinforcements,
被增强 奖惩驱动
by punishment, by reward.
而人本主义心理学认为
And what humanistic psychology said was that
我们不只是被击打的台球
we are much more than a billiard ball being knocked around.
我们有精神 有灵魂
We have spirit. We have a soul.
我们有重要的认知与思想
We have cognitions and thoughts that matter.
不能只靠行为观察 改善人生
It's not just behavior that is important for understanding as well as improving life.
然后是第二势力精神分析学
And then psychoanalysis, the second force.
精神分析学主要通过潜意识分析
The psychoanalysis is about basically understanding mostly through the subconscious:
它决定你的理解
that's how you understand it;
决定如何改善生活
that's how you improve the quality of life.
还有防卫机制
There are defense mechanisms,
人类本能论 神经症
there are biological instincts, neurosis--
如果你理解这些黑暗势力
and if you understand these very often dark forces,
就能更好地处理生活
were better able to deal with life:
了解并改善生活质量
understand as well as improve the quality of life.
人本主义心理学认为人类不止如此
Humanistic psychology says human beings are much more than that.
不仅仅是生理本能
Much more than biological instincts,
不仅仅是神经症
much more than neurosis,
不仅仅是牛顿学说世界里的台球
much more than the person who exists in a Newtonian reality like a billiard ball.
我们要重视人的本质
We need to value much more the human being.
给予人更多的自尊和自由
We need to give much more dignity and freedom to the person.
但有一个问题
There was a problem.
人本主义心理学缺少严谨的方法论
The problem was humanistic psychology is said lacked the rigorous methodology.
但它引入了许多精彩的理念
While it brought in many wonderful ideas,
对于幸福感的研究
talked about the study of well-being,
乐观主义的研究
talked about the study of optimism,
善良 道德 美德
of kindness, of morality, of virtue,
爱 两性关系 巅峰体验
of love, of relationships, of peak experiences,
自我实现 移情
of self-actualization, of empathy.
这些精彩的概念都会在本学期探讨
All these wonderful concepts that we'll talk about throughout the semester.
它的认识论并不严谨
It wasn't as rigorous about its epistemology,
如何形成理念 如何学习
about how we form ideas and how we learn.
所以在很多方面 大部分
And that's why, in many ways, largely,
不完全但大部分成为了自助运动
not completely but largely more of into the self-health movement.
有趣 有益 重要的理念
Interesting ideas, good ideas, important ideas,
意图当然是好的
certainly good intentions,
但就某种程度上
but to some extent,
330:25:49,130 --&gt; 00:25:50,890
缺乏学术严谨性
without the academic rigor.
所以它在学术上影响很小
And that's why it lacked the impact on academia.
所以很少有大学开设人本主义心理学
That's why we don't have partly any humanistic psychology classes offered in universities today.
几乎没有
There are very few still around.
所以本质上成为了新纪元运动
And this is why also a lot of it became the New Age essentially.
但是
But still,
我们很快会了解到 人本主义心理学
it's humanistic psychology that has in many ways fathered and mothered,
孕育了积极心理学
as we'll see, positive psychology.
然我们先见见祖父祖母
So let's meet the grandparents.
比如Rollo May和Carl Rogers
People like Rollo May. People like Carl Rogers.
还有最著名的Abraham Maslow
And more than anyone, Abraham Maslow.
曾是美国心理学会主席
Was the American Psychological Association President.
布兰迪斯大学教授
Was the professor just down the road here at Brandeis (Brandeis University).
他于1954年提出了人本主义心理学
And he introduced this humanistic psychology in 1954.
他写了一章《为了积极心理学》
He wrote a chapter, called "Toward the Positive Psychology".
48954年 他在其中写到 我们需要研究954. In it he said we need to also research kindness,
善良 美德 快乐与乐观
goodness and happiness and optimism.
可以说这是超前于他时代的
In many ways it was way ahead of his time.
如果说Maslow是祖父
Then if Maslow is the grandfather,
那Karen Horney就是祖母了
then Karen Horney is the grandmother.
她最初是精神分析学者
Initially a psychoanalyst,
学习弗洛伊德的理论
trained through the works of Freud,
意识到其过于注重消极面
she realized the focuses had been too much on the negative--
神经症 精神病 她认为
on neurosis, on psychosis and said we also,
还必须关注影响人类生命体的东西
not only but also have to focus on what is working on human organism.
我们需要研究培养那些好的品质
We have to work and look at the fine qualities and cultivate those.
因为它们也是我们的一部分
Because part of being human is being those things as well.
反而向人本主义靠近了 并由此产生了
In many ways, brought about the movement toward humanistic psychology and through that--
积极心理学
positive psychology.
还有Aaron Antonovsky
Aaron Antonovsky,
第三位祖父级人物
the third person I would consider the grandfather,
提出了关注健康的理念
brought in the idea of focusing on health.
他提出了一个新概念
He has a new concept.
或者说他引进了一个新概念
Or he introduced a new concept.
我还在 别担心
I'm still here. Don't worry.
他引进了一个新概念 他称之为
He introduced a new concept, which he called--
他个人创造的新词
his own neologism,
健康本源学
"salutogenesis".
由两部分组成 saluto健康 geneis起源
Salutogenesis: saluto--(which is) health; geneis (which is) origin.
健康的起源
The origin of health.
这是病理学常规模型的
And this was an alternative model,
替代模型
to the conventional ways model of pathologies.
也就是说除了研究病理学
So instead of just studying pathologies
无论是生理健康 还是心理健康
whether it's in physical health or psychological health,
还需要研究健康的起源
we should also study the origin of health.
这也是预防医学所关注的
In many ways that is what prevented medicine is about.
这在1970年代 是一个全新的理念
So this was a novel idea back in 1970s when he introduced it.
我们会仔细讨论Aaron Antonovsky
And we'll talk a lot about Aaron Antonovsky.
现在转到父辈
Now the parents.
Martin Seligman被认为是积极心理学之父
Martin Seligman, considered the father of the positive psychology,
与一群相关学者
network of scholars,
于1998年确立了这一领域
started the field in 1998.
和马斯洛一样 也是美国心理协会会长
Like Maslow, he too, was the President of American Psychological Association.
他任职期间的首要任务
And as his mandate, during his presidency,
是实现两个目标
he had two aims:
第一 让学院式心理学变得通俗
the first aim-- to make academic psychology more accessible,
也就是说
-- in other words--
连接起象牙塔与普罗大众
bridge Ivory tower and mainstream.
这是他任职期间的第一目标
This was the first aim of his presidency.
第二 是引进一个积极的心理学
The second aim was introduce a positive psychology.
需要着眼于有用的东西
A psychology that will look at also things that work,
不仅仅是研究
that were not just study--
抑郁 焦虑 精神分裂 神经症
depression, anxiety, schizophrenia and neurosis.
还需要关注
A psychology a network of scholars who will focus on
爱 两性关系 自尊
-- love, relationships, self-esteem,
动机 恢复以及幸福感
motivation, resilience and well-being.
他提出了这些理念
And he introduced these ideas
从那时起便蓬勃发展起来
and it's all been literally uphill from then.
在Martin Seligman之前
Before Martin Seligman,
都发生在1998年 下次我们会详谈
this all happened in 1998 and we'll talk about it a little bit more next time.
这都诞生于1998年
This all  happened in 1998.
而早在1998年前
Long before 1998,
Ellen Langer教授就已研究了这些领域
our very own professor Ellen Langer did research in all these areas,
将人本主义精神与学术科学严谨性结合
bringing the humanistic spirit and combining it with the academic scientific rigor.
我们对她的讨论会比对其他人多
We'll be talking probably more than any other scholar about her work in this class.
还有一位哈佛的教授
And another person from Harvard,
积极心理学的另一位父辈 Philip Stone
one of the parents of positive psychology was Philip Stone,
两年前的昨天去世了
who passed away two years ago, yesterday.
两位都是我的物理学导师
Both Langer and Stone were my physicist advisors,
带我进入了积极心理学领域的研究
introduced me to the field of positive psychology into this research.
13998年我第一次参加积极心理学峰会
In 1998 when I had the first positive psychology summit,
Stone教授带我同去
Professor Stone took me along with him.
我那时在攻读硕士学位
I was a graduate student.
16999年 他首次在哈佛开设了本课程
In 1999 he taught the first positive psychology class at Harvard,
在全球范围内也是首批
one of the first in the world.
我是他的教研员
I was his teaching fellow.
两年后 他又重新开设了课程
A couple of years later, he taught it again.
我仍旧担任教研员
Again I was his teaching fellow.
后来我毕业了
And then when I graduated,
他提议我接手他的课程
he suggested I take over his class.
直到今天
And here we are today.
这就是1504号心理学课程
So this is 1504.
我再来讲讲...
Let me give you a sense of,
接下来的半小时
in the next half an hour and so,
我会向你们介绍下这门课的内容
a sense of what you expect in this class.
首先 这门课不光是传授信息
The first thing is this class is not just about information,
而且关于如何变形 显而易见
it is also explicitly about transformation.
这是什么意思
What do I mean by that?
如今大多数教育都只是传达信息
You see most of education today is about information.
什么是信息
What is information?
比如 我们有一个容器
So we have a container,
340:31:44,990 --&gt; 00:31:47,720
也就是我们的思想
which is our mind.
信息就是接收数据
And information is about taking data,
接收科学 接收信息 储存到容器里
taking science, taking information and putting it inside the form.
这就是信息
That is information.
等容器填满了
Now when this form is filled,
我们就毕业了
that's when we are educated.
信息数据越多越好
More information, more data, better.
这还不够
Not enough.
因为信息无法决定我们的幸福感
Because it's not just information that determines our wellbeing,
我们的成功 自尊 动机水平
our success, our self-esteem, our motivational level,
两性关系及其质量
the relationship and the quality of our relationships.
光有信息还不够
It's much more than information.
46
变形则是把容器的形状改变
Transformation is about taking this form and changing it.
"trans"即改变 "form"即形状
Trans, (which is) change, form, (which is) shape.
改变形状
Change the form.
这就是变形
This is transformation.
这是Robert Kegan教授
This is the distinction that I learned first from at the school Professor Robert Kegan
教我的第一区别
who taught about this.
接收信息 关注信息本身是不够的
Information in and of itself is not enough.
听听这个例子
Think about this example.
你去参加运动会
You go for an athletic meet.
目标是进入前三
Your aim is to get into the top three--
获得奖牌
to be a medalist.
但是只获得第八名
You come in number eight.
你会如何分析
What's the analysis?
你会如何解读? 太糟糕了
What's the interpretation? -- Terrible.
我彻底失败了
I just failed.
你灰心丧气 感到无力
You feel deflated. Enervated.
但从另一角度看
On the other hand,
同样的比赛
the exact same event.
你期望获得前三 但只得到第八
You came eight when you expected to be top three.
你可以解读为"我学到了什么?
You can interpret it as "Ok, so what have I learned?
我还需要更努力地训练"
I need to work even harder."
你会更有动力
You become more energized.
从经验中学习
You learned from the experience.
也就是说 同样的客观信息
In other words, the same objective information which is
"我是第八名 我目标前三"
"I got eighth; I expected top three".
同样的信息
The same information,
截然不同的解读
very different interpretation.
一个认为是灾难
One is a disaster,
另一个则当成机遇
the other interpretation is an opportunity.
一个让人失去动力
One leads to loss of energy,
另一个增加动力
the other one to increasing energy.
还有一个很普遍的例子
Or think about another very common example.
世界各地很多人似乎拥有了一切
We know of many people around the world who seemingly have everything,
人生顺利
who are doing well,
生活富庶
who have more than they need.
但仍旧不快乐
And yet they are unhappy.
而另一些人拥有的不多
And then there are people around the world who have very little.
但从未中断
And yet they never cease,
从未停止享受人生
never stop to celebrate life.
还有相反的情况
And we have another way around as well.
拥有一切的人 充满感恩 享受生活
People who have everything and appreciate it and enjoy life.
生活窘迫的人觉得自己是受害者
People who have very little and who see themselves as victim.
也就是说 重要的不仅仅是获得了什么信息
In other words, it's not just the information that goes in.
还有是何形状
It's also the shape,
如何解读 如何理解 关注的重点
the interpretation, the perception, the focus.
这就是由容器的形状所决定的
And that is determined by the shape of the form.
这是我在本科生阶段所认识到的
This is what I realized when I was an undergrad here.
表面上看 我拥有了一切
Seemingly, looking in from the outside, I had everything.
体育运动
Doing well (in) sports,
学术 社交都很成功
academics and socially.
但是我对生命的理解
And yet my perception,
关注和解读并不正面
my focus, my interpretation of life-- not that great.
我不快乐
I wasn't happy.
我们后面会讲 通常解读比信息更重要
The interpretation matters very often a lot more as we'll see than the information that goes in.
有一句话我会在课程中经常引用
One of the sentences that I'll repeat throughout the class is that
快乐由我们的精神状态而定 而不是社会地位或银行存款
happiness is much more contingent on our state of mind than our status or the state of our bank account.
所以需要变形
And that's where transformation comes in.
这对建立幸福感来说很重要
And that's why it's so important for wellbeing.
所以我们在实际操作时
What that will look like in practice
不会传达过多信息方面的东西
is that we'll cover not so much information.
而是挖掘更多东西 不是联想意义上的
We'll uncover much more and I don't mean that in the Berkeley (George Berkeley) sense of the word.
而是学术意义上的
I mean that in the academic sense of the word.
也就是说
In other words,
我们要挖掘自身潜能
what we'll do is uncover potential that we have inside,
这种潜能一直存在
that we have inside of us all along.
只是我们没有发现
Maybe we just didn't see.
或者被其他东西掩盖了
Or maybe it's obscured by something or another.
我们要发现利用它
We'll uncover it so that we can utilize it,
以便关注它
so that we can focus on it,
以便理解它
so that we can perceive it.
我讲个故事来说明吧
Here is a story just to illustrate it.
比如米开朗基罗
So this is Michelangelo.
曾经有个记者问他
One day he was asked by a journalist of his time,
您是如何创造出《大卫》这件巨作的?
"how did you create this most amazing masterpiece, David?",
米开朗基罗回答
to which Michelangelo responded,
很简单
"it was easy.
我去了趟采石场
I went to the quarry.
看见一块巨大的大理石
I saw this huge piece of marble.
我在它身上看到了大卫
And in it I saw David.
我只要凿去多余的石头
All I needed to do was to chip away the excess stone,
只留下有用的
to get rid of the marble that shouldn't have been there.
凿去多余的石头之后 大卫就诞生了
And when I got rid of this excess stone, there was David.
虽然说的比做的容易
" Not obviously easier said than done.
但是这个故事抓住了这门课程精髓
But the story captured the metaphor of what this class very much is about.
即凿除多余石块
It's about chipping away the excess stone.
也就是摆脱限制 阻碍
It's about getting rid of limitations, of barriers,
或者对失败的恐惧
whether it's the fear of failure,
这些东西在并不是与生俱来的
something that we didn't have as kids.
但如今却出现在了大多数人身上
But today most people in our culture have it.
要凿除削弱甚至伤害我们的完美主义
It's about chipping away perfectionism that is debilitating and often hurts us.
凿除胜利的能力
It's about chipping away our ability for success,
因为我们可能害怕胜利
because maybe we are afraid of success.
可能对生命中一些东西感到内疚
Maybe we feel guilty about some of the things that we have in our life,
这些都会反过来限制我们
and that in turn limits us.
也许甚至还要凿除两性关系中的限制
Maybe it's about chipping away the limitations on our relationships
尤其是带来消极面的时候
in while we don't thrive within them.
这些就是本课程的主要内容
This is what this class is mostly about.
就像梭罗说的那样
As Thoreau says,
"做减法比做加法让灵魂成长得更快"
"soul grows more by subtraction than by addition",
减法包括除去那些
by getting rid of these limitations,
阻碍我们发挥潜能的限制
limitations that are preventing us from fulfilling our potential.
因为我们的潜能是天生的
Because our potential is in there in nature.
我们关注人类本性
We talk a lot about human nature.
是与生俱来的 无论是上帝赐予的
It's there whether it's through God,
还是进化产生的
whether it's through evolution.
但是渐渐地受到外部文化压力
We have a lot of potential that over time with we fix (?) stone of voices with being part of our culture
像多余石料一样 把我们禁锢起来了
that very often these limitations are put on top of us just like the excess stone.
老子说过
Lao Tzu, "In pursuit of knowledge every day something is acquired.
"为学日益
In pursuit of wisdom,
为道日损"
every day something is dropped."
"学"即信息
Knowledge is about information.
"道"即变形
Wisdom is about transformation.
我最近参加一次大型咨询业会议时
I was recently interviewed for a newsletter on coaching
接受了一家相关期刊的采访
before a large conference on the topic.
采访者问我
And the interviewer asked me,
"能给读者传授些积极心理学建议吗"
"So what tips, what tools can you give from positive psychology?"
于是我谈到了一些热门话题
So I talked about some of "the greatest hits":
感恩的重要性
the importance of gratitude,
体育锻炼的重要性
the importance of physical exercise.
我谈到了花时间经营爱情的重要性
I talked about the importance of spending time on our relationships,
谈到了休息 简化 等等
about taking time aside and simplifying and so on and so on.
我正滔滔不绝时
As I was going through my long list,
她打断了我 说
she stopped me and she said,
谢谢 Tal 这些都不错
"You know Tal, this is all good.
那些事情的重要性 我明白
The importance of stuff, I know.
但这些我们的读者都已经知道了
But our readers already know that.
我想要的是轰动的因素
I am looking for the Wow factor.
能让我意外的东西
Come on, surprise me.
能否告诉我们的读者?"
What can you tell our readers?"
我想了一会这个问题
And I thought about this question for a minute
然后意识到根本没有什么惊奇可言
and I realized that there is no Wow.
我跟她这么说了
And I told her that,
"所谓的轰动之处就是没有轰动之处"
"you know if there is a wow, the wow is that there is no wow."
就是这样
That's it.
因为没有经过转变
Because the over-not-transformation emperor,
快速见效的说法都是皇帝的新衣
the emperor of quick fixes has no clothes.
是不存在的
It doesn't exist.
是过高的承诺和过低的兑现
it's over-promising and under-delivering.
生活 令人满意的生活
A life, a fulfilling life,
丰富的生活包括了起起落落
a rich life includes ups and downs,
包括了痛苦和再次振作
includes pain and getting up again,
包括了失败和再次奋斗
includes failure and getting up again.
它包括了成功和庆祝成功
It includes success and celebrating it.
胜利和失败 起起和落落
Victories and losses, ups and downs,
我们下个星期会讲到
as we'll talk about next week.
而不是关乎一个秘密
It's not about this one secret.
一个能让人过上幸福生活的令人惊奇的诀窍
One Wow to the good life.
而你们将在本课程中学到的许多东西
And many of the things you will learn in this class,
都是你们之前听说过的
you've heard of before.
也许对你来说没有什么新鲜的内容
Probably nothing new to you.
在你内心深处你已经知道了
You already know it inside of you.
你会说"这是常识"
And you are going to say, "Well, it is common sense."
是的 很多都是常识
And yes, a lot of it is common sense.
但是 伏尔泰曾经说过
However, it is Voltaire once said,
"常识并非那么平常"
"Common sense is not that common."
特别是应用于实际
And this especially applies to application.
所以本课程的目标是让常识更平常
So the aim of this class is to make common sense more common,
特别是应用到实际中
especially in the real world application.
在本课程结束时
At the end of the class,
我所希望的是
here's what I am hoping for,
在本课程结束之时
at the end of the class,
如果你打算上这门课的话
if you decide to take it.
在本学期结束时
At the end of the semester,
我不想 我不期待你跑来告诉我
I don't think-- I am not expecting you to come and tell me,
"谢谢你教给了这么多新东西"
"Wow! Thank you for teaching me so many new things."
那不是我所期待的
That's not what I am expecting.
我不认为那会发生
I don't think that is what will happen.
我所希望发生的是你过来跟我说
What I hope will happen is for you to come and say,
不是说"谢谢你教了我"
rather than "thank you for teaching me",
之类的话
something you would say
而是"谢谢提醒了我一些我熟知事情"
"thank you for reminding me of something that I've already known".
这就是本课程要做的
And this is what this class is about.
经常性的提醒 一周两次
It's constant reminder, twice a week.
经常提醒你们记起你们已知的东西
Constant reminder of what you already know,
你们内心深处的东西
of what is inside you.
你们心中的大卫
The David that is inside you.
本课程希望做到的是帮助你们凿掉一些束缚
And what this class will hopefully do is to help you chip away some of these limitations,
不管是哪种束缚
whether it's limitation,
是阻碍你认识已熟知事物的认知束缚
cognitive limitations that prevent you from seeing what you already knew,
还是阻碍你从已熟知事物中获取益处的情绪束缚
emotional limitations that are preventing you from deriving the benefits of what you already know,
抑或是行为束缚
or behavioral limitations.
基本要素是影响 行为和认知
The ABC: affect, behavior, and cognition
正是我们在改变周将要讨论的
that we'll talk about during the change week.
我要让常识更平常
So I'm making common sense more common.
信息本身还不够
Information in and of itself is simply not enough.
还不够 而我们除了信息高速公路外还需要转变高速公路
It's not enough and what we need in addition to our information highway is a transformation highway.
是在转变高速公路
Transformation high way,
还是转变乡村小道上
or transformation back roads,
来经历快速增长的步伐
to come through the fast increasing pace.
因为就像我们下次课会说到的那样
Because as we'll talk about next time,
抑郁率呈上升趋势
rates of depression are on the rise,
焦虑率呈上升趋势
rates of anxiety are on the rise,
不只是在这个国家 是全球化的现象
not just in this country, globally.
简直就是全球传染病
It's literally global epidemic.
而为了应对它
And to deal with it,
更多的信息也并不够
more information will just not do.
并不够
Just not enough.
下面是Archibald MacLeish的话
Here is Archibald MacLeish.
他生前是一位诗人 是哈佛的教授
He was a poet, was a Harvard professor,
"错的不是科学的重大发现
"What is wrong is not the great discoveries of science--
有信息永远比无知强
information is always better than ignorance,
不管是什么样信息和什么样无知
no matter what information or what ignorance.
错在于信息背后的信念
What is wrong is the belief behind the information,
认为信息会改变世界的信念
the belief that information will change the world.
但它不会"
It won't."
往我们的容器里增加 装上越来越多的东西
Just adding it and filling up our containers with more and more stuff.
越来越多的信息 越来越多的数据
More and more information, more and more data.
还是不够
It's just not enough.
我们需要更多
We need more than that.
本课程将采用一种人性的方法
This class will take a humanistic approach.
我来给你们读一小段Abraham Maslow的话
Let me read you a quick excerpt by Abraham Maslow who talks about this approach,
"如果有人上了一门关于心理学学习的课
"If one took a course or picked up a book on the psychology of learning,
或者看了一本这方面的书
most of it,
大部分内容 在我看来 是与重点无关的
in my opinion, would be beside the point -
也就是 与人性无关
that is, beside the 'humanistic' point.
大部分内容把学习展现为获得联想
Most of it would present learning as the acquisition of associations,
技能和能力 这些对于人的性格 人的个性
of skills and capacities that are external and not intrinsic to the human character,
人本身来说只是外在而并非本质的"
to the human personality, to the person himself."
外在是指信息
External refers to information.
内在是指转变
Internal refers to the transformation,
形态的改变
the changing of the form.
当我们谈到转变时
And when we talk about transformation,
实际上是非常字面的说法
actually mean it quite literally--
形态的改变
changing of the form,
大脑的改变 我们一会就谈到
changing of the brain as we'll talk about.
比如我们会谈到冥想
We'll talk about meditation for instance.
72998年通过的核磁共振研究我们知道大脑可以被改变
We know our brain today can actually change through MRI studies since 1998.
一个新的概念叫做神经形成或者神经可塑性
A new concept came up which is Neurogenesis or Neuroplasticity,
是指我们的大脑实际上会改变和转变
meaning our brain actually changes and transforms.
在我们的一生中其形态都在改变
It changes its form throughout our life.
所以我不只是在打比方
So I don't just mean it metaphorically,
我也经常指的是字面意义
I also very often mean it literally.
继续Abraham Maslow的话
Abraham Maslow continues,
"人性的哲学衍生出关于学习
"Humanistic philosophy offers a new conception of learning,
教学和教育的新概念
of teaching, and of education.
简单地说 这一概念认为教育的功能
Stated simply, such a concept holds that the function of education,
教育的目标
the goal of education—
人的目标 人性的目标
the human goal, the humanistic goal,
只要人还是被关注的目标
the goal so far as human beings are concerned—
从根本上是一个人的自我实现
is ultimately the "self-actualization" of a person,
完全成为一个人
the becoming fully human,
达到人类或者是特定的某个个人
the development of the fullest height that the human species can stand up to
能达到的最高高度
or that the particular individual can come to.
通俗点讲
In a less technical way,
就是帮助一个人成为最好的自己"
it is helping the person to become the best that he is able to become."
这些是军队的广告
And this was before the Ad came up for the army.
"做最好的自己"
That "Be all you can be."
这就是本课程所要讲的
This is what the class is about.
这就是人性的方法
It's the humanistic approach.
关于实现我们的潜能
It's about fulfilling our potential,
凿掉那些束缚
chipping away those limitations.
现在对于你们许多人这种方式似乎很天真 很理想主义
Now to many of you this may sound naive, idealistic.
98
并不天真 但理想主义
Naive it is not. Idealistic, it is.
我们会谈到和讨论理想主义和保持理想主义
And we'll talk about and discuss the importance of idealism and maintaining idealism
的重要性 如果我们要介绍个人的改变
if we are to introduce personal change,
个人之间的改变
inter-personal change,
或群体与社会的改变的话
or community or society change.
本课程不是提供
This class is not about providing answers,
关于美好生活和幸福的答案的
concerning the good life and happiness.
是关于辨识正确的问题
It is about identifying the right questions.
"问过之后便会有收获" 圣经如是说
"Ask and ye shall you receive", say the Scripture.
本课程就是我认为的教育的宗旨
This class is what I think education is all about,
也就是对信息和转变的探索 必须由一个问题开始
which is that the quest for information and transformation must begin with the question.
探索 问题
Quest, question,
这两者在词源上有所关联并非巧合
there is no coincidence that there is an etymological link between the two.
在本课程中 我们会问
In this class we'll be asking,
你们会被问许多问题
you'll be asked many questions,
你们将会看到那些问题 创造了现实
questions that as you'll see, create reality.
我们下次会讲到
We'll talk about it already next time.
那些你首先向你自己
The importance of the questions you ask of yourselves first and foremost,
然后向你的搭档 学生
of your partner, of your students,
搭档 未来的雇员
of your parents, of your employees in the future,
和同事提出的问题的重要性
teammates and so on.
问题十分重要
Questions make a difference.
Peter Drucker说"在管理决策中最常见的
Peter Drucker, "The most common source of mistakes in management decisions
错误来源是强调找到正确答案而非正确的问题"
is the emphasis on finding the right answer rather than the right question."
Peter Drucker是20世纪最重要的管理学学者
Peter Drucker, considered the most important management scholar of 20th century,
最近刚刚去世
just recently passed away,
说最大的错误是没有问正确的问题
saying the biggest mistake is not asking the right questions.
我们下次会看到
As we'll see next time,
这也是在研究中潜在的最大的错误
this is the biggest mistake in research potentially.
这也是在应用中最大的错误
This is the biggest mistake in application.
没有问正确的问题
Not asking the right questions as well,
不论是在管理组织
whether it's in managing organizations,
还是在管理我们的生活
whether it's managing our lives.
现在
Now.
当我说问题重要而答案没那么重要时
When I said that questions are important and answers matter less,
我不是从相对论的观点来说的
I am not coming from a point of relativism.
我不是相对论者
I'm not a relativist.
我认为他们...
I think they are ...
对于某些问题 知道决定性的答案很重要
To some questions definitive answers that are important to know.
但是 我所说的是当提到教育时
However, what I'm saying is that it's important,
关注问题很重要 而不是较不重要
not less important to focus on questions when it comes to education.
教育家Neil Postman曾经说过
The educator, Neil Postman once said,
"孩子进校时像问号而毕业时像句号"
"The kids enter schools as question marks and they leave as periods."
我的希望是本课程培养的问号要比句号多
My hope in this class is to bring up many more question marks than periods.
再一次 这是关于凿掉多余的石头
Once again, it's about chipping away the excess stone because as kids,
因为作为孩子 我们永远都在问问题
we are always asking questions.
我们永远都很好奇
We are always curious.
我来放一段我最喜爱的心理学家之一的录影
Let me show you a quick excerpt from a video of one of my favorite psychologists,
其实是喜剧演员宋飞
actually the commedian, Seinfeld.
他要讲的是...
Here he is talking about...
我们这个学期会看很多录影
We will watch a lot of excerpts throughout the semester.
如果像孩子一样我们会是怎样
Talking about what we were like as kids.
看看你们看得见不
See is this in your way
"于是前两年 我自己做服装 当然不怎么样
"So, the first couple of years I made my own costumes which of course sucked:
鬼啊 流浪汉啊...
the ghost, the hobo...
第三年我终于求了爸妈
Then, finally, the third year, begging the parents,
我得到了超人的万圣节服装
I got the Superman Halloween costume.
并不奇怪
Not surprisingly.
纸盒箱 自己做的上衣 还有面具
Cardboard box, self-made top, mask included.
还记得面具后面的橡皮筋不?
Remember the rubber band on the back of that mask?
那可是个质量不错的玩意 不是吗?
That was a quality item there, wasn't it?
它可以坚持用10秒钟
That was good for about 10 seconds
之后就会从那个廉价订书钉里掉出来
before it snapped out of that cheap little staple they put it in there with.
你去了第一个人家
You go to your first house:
"不给糖就..."啪嗒 橡皮筋断了
"Trick or..." Snap!" It broke.
简直不敢相信!
I don't believe it!"
"你们等我一下! 我能修好它!
"Wait up you guys! I gotta fix it!
等我一下! 等我一下!"
Hey wait up! Wait up!"
孩子们不说"等"
Kids don't say "wait".
他们说"等我一下! 等我一下!"
They say "wait up! Hey wait up!"
因为当你还小的时候 你的生活都在上面
Coz when you are little your life is up.
你的未来在上面 你所要的一切都在上面
Your future is up. Everything you want is up.
"等一下! 举起来! 闭嘴!"
"Wait up! Hold up! Shut up!
"妈妈 打扫一下! 让我晚点睡吧!"
Momma, clean up! Let me stay up!"
父母当然刚好相反 一切都在下面
Parents of course are just the opposite. Everything is down.
"冷静! 慢一点!
"Just calm down! Slow down!
给我冷静! 坐下 把那个放下!"
Calm down here! Sit down. Put that down!"
所以孩子们的这种好奇
So again this curiosity,
这种寻找
this looking up,
这种开放的心态是与封闭相反的
this opening up is opposed to closing down that kids have.
我希望在本课程中会产生这种观念
This notion. This is what I hope will happen in this class.
教育的真正目的
The one real objective of education
是让一个人可以连续发问
is to leave a man in the condition of continually asking questions.
所以下面讲讲John Carter所作的纵向研究
So here is a longitudinal study that was done by John Carter.
John Carter 河对面的商学院的领导管理学教授
John Carter, professor of leadership management of the business school across the river,
83972年来到哈佛
came to Harvard in 1972,
做了老师并开始关注哈佛的课程
joined the faculty and started to follow Harvard class,
从1973年起一直关注了20年MBA课程
MBA class of 1973 and followed them through 20 years.
他想尽可能收集所有关于这门课的信息
And what he was interested in was to find all the information he could about this class.
870年后 90年代初当这个研究结束时
What he found 20 years later,
他发现这些学生都极其成功
early 90s when this study ended was these students were extremely successful,
以前的学生都极其成功 学生们都极其成功
Or ex-students were extremely successful, students were extremely successful,
非常有钱 有很大的影响力
very wealthy, having a lot of impact,
不论是在组织上 还是社会上
whether it's on the organizations, on the community.
他们都做得极其好
They did extremely well.
但是在这群极其成功的哈佛MBA里
But within the large group of highly successful Harvard MBAs,
他发现有一小部分人是格外成功的
he found a small group that was extraordinarily successful,
比其它人要更成功
more successful than the rest of group,
无论是在收入上
whether in terms of income,
还是在影响力上
whether in terms of impact,
抑或是在总体生活质量上
whether in terms of overall quality of life.
格外的成功
Extraordinarily successful.
他想弄明白其中的原因
What he wanted to identify was why--
这一小部分人和其他人有何区别
what distinguishes this small group from the rest of the pack:
其他人也非常成功 但没有那一小组人那么成功
very successful, but not quite as successful as that small group.
他只找出了两件事
And he found only two things.
不是他们的智商对他们长期成功的因素没有影响
It was not their IQs that made no difference whatsoever to their long-term success.
不是他们在念MBA之前的出身
It was not where they came from, pre-MBA,
他们做的事和这一点关系都没有
what they did had nothing to do with it.
只有两件事会决定谁会成为格外成功的人
Two and two things along mattered in terms of determining
和其余的人上有关系
who will be the extraordinarily successful and the rest:
第一是那部分人真的相信自己
the first thing was the extraordinarily successful groups really believe in themselves.
他们认为自己能做好
They thought they could do well.
他们有目的
They were driven.
他们有动力
They were motivated.
我们会在下一次课讲到自我实现的预言
And we'll talk about it in future lecture as belief in self-fulfilling prophecies.
他们认为"我会做到
They thought "I'm going to make it.
我会成功"
I'm going to succeed."
这是第一件事
That's the first thing.
自信
The sense of the confidence.
他发现的第二件事是 这部分人
The second thing that he found was this group,
一直在问问题
they were always asking questions,
一直问问题
--always asking questions,
最初是问他们的老板
initially of their boss,
后来是问他们的雇员
later of their employees,
他们的搭档 孩子 父母 朋友
of their partners, children, parents, friends.
他们一直在问问题
They were always asking question.
他们一直处于好奇的状态
They were always at the state of curiosity.
一直在寻找 有开放的心态
Always looking up, opening up,
想要更加了解世界
wanting to understand the world the more.
他们没有说"我现在有了MBA学位
They didn't say "Now I have my MBA.
就行了 我知道的够多了"
That's it. I know enough.
他们是终身学习者
" They were life-long learners.
他们一直在问问题
They were always asking questions.
这两个区别性的特质
These two distinguishing characteristics
导致了格外成功和成功的人之间的差别
account for the difference between the extraordinarily successful and those who were successful.
那个指引了我的问题 不论是写书
The question that has guided me whether it's in writing the book,
还是开设这门课程
whether it's in creating this class,
还是被我所称的"问题的问题"
whether it's first and foremost my personal life is what I call "the question of the question",
就是"我们如何能帮助自己和他人
which is "how can we help ourselves and others,
个人 群体和社会变得更幸福?"
individuals, communities and society become happier?"
注意这不是关于帮助我们自己和他人变得幸福
Note that it is not about helping ourselves and others become happy.
而是关于变得更幸福
It is about becoming happier.
为什么? 因为很多人问我
Why? Because many people ask me,
"那么Tal 你幸福吗?"
"So Tal, are you happy?"
我真的不能回答那个问题
And I can't really answer that question.
我不知道那是什么意思
I don't know what it means.
我如何判断自己是否幸福?
How do I determine whether or not I am happy?
是和别人比较?
Is it compared to someone else?
是不是存在一个点 超过之后就变幸福了?
Is there a certain point beyond which I become happy?
幸福不是二进制的非此即彼 0或
Happiness is not a binary either-or, zero-one--
要么幸福要么不幸福
either I'm happy or I'm unhappy.
幸福存在于一个连续统一体
Happiness resides on a continuum.
所以我对这个问题的回答-- "我幸福吗?"
So my answer to this question-- "am I happy?"
我今天是否比我15年前刚开始关注幸福时更幸福
is today I'm happier than I was 15 years ago when I started focusing on this pursuit.
535年后我当然希望自己能比今天幸福5 years from now I certainly hope to be happier than I am today.
幸福是终身的追求
Happiness is lifelong pursuit.
希望本课程是这种追求的一部分
Hopefully this class is part of that pursuit,
但只是一部分
but just part.
你们不会在课结束时幸福
You'll not be happy at the end of class.
希望你们能比现在幸福
Hopefully you'll be happier.
因为很多人坐在这听有关自尊的讲座时 比如
Cos many people sit here during the lectures on self-esteem, for example,
或者当我们明确地讨论幸福时
or when we talk explicitly about happiness,
他们说 "等等 我的自尊心强吗?"
they say, "Wait. Do I have self-esteem?"--
他们自己想到
Thinking to themselves.
"我的自尊是较强的还是较弱的?"
"Do I have high self-esteem or low self-esteem?" Irrelevant.
这也是没有意义 无法回答的
Impossible to answer also.
问题是"我如何能提高我的自尊
The question is "how can I improve my self-esteem,
我健康的自尊
my healthy self-esteem,
而当然不是自恋?
not narcissism of course?
我怎样才能变得幸福?"
How can I become happier?"
那是一个重要的问题
That's an important question.
这是问题的问题
And this is the question of questions.
本课程不是一个积极心理学的概论
This class is not a survey of positive psychology.
如果你想要关于积极心理学的概论
If you want a survey on positive psychology,
我可以推荐一些很不错的课本
I can recommend some excellent textbooks
Lopez或是Peterson的书
whether it's by Lopez (Shane J. Lopez) or by Peterson (Chris Peterson).
很不错的课本 还有一本积极心理学手册
Great textbooks. There is also The Handbook of Positive Psychology
一本很厚的书 里面有这个领域里大多数你想知道的内容
which is a huge book with most what you want to know about this field.
你也可以用它自卫
You can also use it in self-defense.
自卫非常管用
Very useful in that respect.
但是本很棒的书 写得非常好
But a wonderful book, very well-written,
让人很容易理解积极心理学
very accessible in the spirit of positive psychology.
但这里讲的不是那些
But this is not that.
不是积极心理学概论
This is not a survey of positive psychology.
而是对"问题中的问题"的选择性探索
What it is is a selective exploration of the question of the questions.
从那个角度讲 它是折衷的
In that way, it is eclectic.
我的背景是心理学和哲学
My background is in psychology and philosophy.
我学了组织行为学
I studies organizational behavior.
我做过几年商业顾问
I worked as a consultant in business for a few years.
仍然还做一些这方面的工作
Still do some work there.
我在教育领域工作过
I worked in the field of education,
在教育领域内做过很多工作
doing a lot of work in field of education.
我从所有这些领域中吸取内容
And I take from all these areas.
我还不只是从积极心理学中吸取内容
I also draw on not just from positive psychology.
我把临床心理学的内容融入这个课程中
I draw on clinical psychology in this class.
我融入了认知心理学
I draw on cognitive psychology,
社会心理学等等内容
social psychology and so on.
这是一个折衷的课程
It's an eclectic class.
因为我的问题
Because my question,
我的引导性问题是"什么会对幸福有贡献?"
my guiding question was "what would contribute to happiness?"
如果我认为精神病理学的内容
And if something within psychopathology I thought could contribute to our wellbeing,
能对我们的幸福有贡献 我会吸取并利用之
I took that and used that.
而如果一些有关组织行为学的咨询领域的东西有用
And if something from the field of consulting in organizational behavior could contribute,
那也会成为本课程的一部分
that became part of the class,
只要能在一个学期内讲完
as much as I could fit in of course in one semester.
所以本课程是折衷的
So the class is eclectic.
本课程不是跨文化交流
The class is not cross-cultural.
我会引进一些东方思想的观点
I will bring in ideas from eastern thoughts.
我在亚洲住过几年
I lived in Asia for a few years.
我在那工作
I worked there.
持续研究东方哲学和心理学
Studied and continue to study the eastern philosophies and psychologies.
但我的专业主要是在西方心理学上
But my train primarily is in western psychology.
而课程的重点将会是西方心理学
And the focus of the class will be that.
但是那并不意味着
However that doesn't mean
积极心理学不适用于世界上其他地方的人
that positive psychology doesn't apply to people from different places in the world.
最近有一场高资历科学家之间的会议
There was recently a meeting between senior scientists,
来自西方的心理学家
psychologists from the west,
像Paul Ekman和Richard Davidson
people like Paul Ekman, Richard Davidson-
这些在心理学领域内最重要的人物
some of the most important minds in the field of psychology
和达赖喇嘛还有他的一些僧侣进行会谈
meeting with the Dalai Lama and some of his monks.
他们谈论了心理学的未来 研究
They were talking about the future of psychology, about the research,
还有如何研究冥想等等
and how can you research meditation and so on.
而他们谈论较多的话题之一就是文化差异
And one of the things they were talking a lot about is the cross-cultural differences.
当提到这个问题时
And when that came up,
达赖喇嘛突然好像很不舒服
the Dalai Lama suddenly seemed uneasy.
当记录整个会议的Daniel Goleman
And when Daniel Goleman who was writting about this whole event
会议是在印度开的 问他怎么了
and it was held in India asked him what's wrong,
他说他不是因为谈到并强调文化差异而不舒服
Dalai Lama said that he was not comfortable with talking and emphasizing so much cultural differences.
对达赖喇嘛你可以有很多评价
You can say many things about Dalai Lama.
但你不能说他在文化方面不敏感
One thing you cannot say about him is that he's culturally insensitive,
他可以说是还在世的最敏感的人之一
arguably one of the most sensitive people alive.
然而他说 我们对文化差异的关注太多了
And yet he said  we are focusing too much on cultural differences
他补充道不是因为没有文化差异
and he added not because there are no cultural differences.
当然有而且很重要
Of course there are and they are important.
但文化共同性要比差异多
But there are many more similarities than differences.
而我们不应该无视这些共同性
And we shouldn't ignore those similarities.
Daniel Goleman如此评价达赖喇嘛
Daniel Goleman about the Dalai Lama,
"我们有点惊讶于达赖喇嘛这种表面上的
"We were a little bit surprised by the Dalai Lama's seeming resistance
对文化差异概念的抵触"
to the notion of cultural differences.
所以我想介绍这些观点 但是首先
So I am willing to introduce these ideas but A,
因为这不是我的专业
because it's not my training and people
研究文化差异的人会比我做得更好
who are focusing on cultural differences will do a much better job than I do;
其次 因为我所希望研究的是普遍事物
and second, because what I hope to look into is the universal,
不同文化中普遍的东西
things are common across cultures.
所以我们会在这方面进行研究
So we'll study research in this area.
但不只是这样
But even more than that,
我们的讨论比这部分心理学更具体
we'll become even more particular than just talking about psychology in this part of the world.
我们将会研究你们自己
We'll study yourselves.
我们会如此具体
We are going to go that particular.
0480:59:56,770 --&gt; 01:00:00,
为什么? 当我开这门课程时
Now why? When I put this class together,
我自己没想过
I didn't think to myself,
"好的 我需要介绍些什么东西
"Ok, so what are the things that I need to introduce
以便能取悦课程的参与者 这些学生呢?"
in order to please the participants in the class, the students?"
那不是我所想的
That's not what I thought.
我所想的是"如果我是个本科生 会想上什么课?
What I thought about was "what was the class that I would have wanted to take as an undergraduate here?
如果我坐在这 什么能让我更幸福?"
What would help me become happier if I were sitting there?"
换言之 从我的观点 从非常个人的观点出发
In other words, thinking from my perspective from very personal perspective.
在我们的课上 我会鼓励你们
In this class I am going to encourage you.
当然你们可以看和阅读关于别人的研究
Of course you'll look at research and read research about other people,
有大量的样本
about large sample sizes.
但最主要的 我会鼓励你们去看自己的内心
But I'm going to encourage you more than anything to look inside yourselves.
去研究自己
To study yourselves.
无论是通过两周后开始的每周一次的课后论文
Whether it's through response papers that will be due weekly starting in 2 weeks;
还是你们最后的演示作业 你们不用做演示
whether it's in your final project that will be a presentation
但要写出来 一个关于你最感兴趣的话题
that you won't have to give but you'll have to write out--
或者对你来说最重要的话题的演示
a presentation about your favorite topic or the topic that matters most to you;
还是关于如何能把这些观点应用于我的生活
whether it's in sections that you'll be talking about how can I apply these ideas to my life.
"练习时间"是关于如何接受和利用一些观点
The time-ins are about thinking about how can I take in the ideas and use them.
是关于研究我们自己
It's about studying ourselves.
因为正如Carl Rogers所说
Because as Carl Rogers says,
"越是个人的东西越普遍"
"What is most personal is most general."
"越是个人的东西越普遍"
"What is most personal is most general."
正如Maslow所补充
And as Maslow adds,
"我们必须记住对一个人深层本性的认识
"We must remember that knowledge of one's own deep nature
同时也是对普遍人类本性的认识"
is also simultaneously knowledge of human nature in general."
当我们更了解自己时
When we understand ourselves better,
当我们认识到自己时
when we identify ourselves,
我们就更能认识他人
we are better able to identify with others.
事实上 从许多方面说这是有益移情的来源
In fact, this is in many ways the source of empathy, of the healthy empathy.
有些研究表明了解自己的人
And there are some studies showing that people who know themselves,
研究自己的人 反思自己的人
who study themselves, who are self-reflective,
对别人做出过分的行为
display less egregious behavior,
不道德的行为会相对较少
less immoral behavior toward others.
那种比如说种族歧视的行为
Behavior that would fall under say, racism.
在一定程度上这是反直觉的
And it's counter-intuitive to some extent.
"等等 你难道不要首先研究别人
"Wait. Don't you first need to study the other
才能对别人更敏感吗?"
so that you can be more sensitive to others?"
是的 那也需要
Yes, that too.
不过还不够
But it's not enough.
研究我们自己也很重要
It is important to also study ourselves,
因为当我们看到自己的深层本性时
because when we see our deep nature,
我们看到的是部分普遍的本性
what we encounter there is part of the universal nature,
我们所有人之间的共性
the similarities among us all,
不管我们来自哪里
regardless of where we are from.
而这就是达赖喇嘛所说的
And this was what Dalai Lama was talking about:
不是阻止跨文化研究
not stop cross-cultural.
去做吧 很重要
Do it. Important.
但同时 不要忽视自己
But at the same time, not ignore the self.
不要忽视我们每一个人身上的普遍性
Not ignore the universal within each one of us.
C.S. Lewis说 "整个宇宙中有且只有一件
C.S. Lewis, "There is one thing and only one in the whole universe
我们知道我们可以从外部观察中学习到的事
which we know about that we could learn from external observation.
那就是我们自己
That one thing is ourselves.
我们有 可以说是 内在的信息
We have, so to speak, inside information;
我们是知道的"
we are in the know."
当我们研究自己时当然会有偏颇
Now there are of course biases when we study ourselves
这就是为什么只研究自己是不够的
which is why it's not enough to just study the self.
105
要克服这个问题
It's important to counter it,
把学术工作 研究他人融入进去很重要
to add to it, academic work, studying others.
那就是为什么我们除了探究我们的内心外
That's why we'll do some research or study research as well as do some search--
也会做一些研究或调查研究
searching inside us.
两者并重
Both are important.
我们不应该 只是因为会有潜在的偏颇和错误
We shouldn't, just because there are biases and mistakes that potentially can be made,
这并不意味着我们要因噎废食
it doesn't mean we need to throw out the baby with the bath water
停止探究自己
and stop studying ourselves.
所以我们会 更准确地说是你们会这样做 比学校里的其他课程做得要多
So we'll do that or rather you'll do that probably more than any other class on campus.
最后这个可能对你们来说有些新
Finally this may be news to you,
但这不是10A号英语课和55号数学课 就是说
but this is not English 10A or Math 55,
你不用像10A号课或者历史课那样做大量的阅读
meaning you'll not have to read as much as you will read for 10A or for a history class,
也不像55号数学课一样难 所以你们可以轻松些
and this class is not as difficult as Math 55 so you rest.
我相信这有些人上过这门课
I'm sure there are some people here who took the class.
本课程同时是一种严格的乐趣
This class at the same time is about rigorous fun.
乐趣...因为研究我们自己很有意思
Fun...because it's fun to study ourselves.
1211:04:12,480 --&gt; 01:04:15,760
有时会让我们受伤 有时我们看到一些我们不愿意看到的东西
Sometimes it hurts and sometimes we see things that we may not like,
但总的来说还是有趣的
but overall it's fun.
很有意思
It's interesting.
同时又是严格的 以研究为基础
And at the same time it's rigorous, based on research.
你们将在本课程中遇到的许多观点都很简单
Now many of the ideas that you'll encounter in this class are very simple,
很容易理解
very accessible.
常识
Common sense.
但它们是简单 不是过分简单化
However they are simple, not simplistic.
这两者是有区别的
And here is the difference.
Oliver Wendell Holmes
Oliver Wendell Holmes--
这个报告厅就是他捐建的
this court is attributed to him,
但不能完全确定是他所有的--说过
not 100% sure it's his-- said,
"我不会认为与复杂性一致的简单性是微不足道的
"I would not give a fig for the simplicity on this side of complexity,
但我会把一生用来研究与复杂性相对的简单性"
but I would give my life for the simplicity on the other side of complexity."
Homles这里的意思是他关心的不只是简单性
What Holmes means here is that he doesn't care about just simplicity,
简单的 随意的 难以预料的想法
easy, off-the-cuff, whimsical ideas.
而他所关心的是之后的简单性
What he does care about though is the simplicity that comes after.
我们深思了这个观点
We have chewed the idea,
在我们吸收了它之后
after we have digested it,
在我们考虑过它之后
after we have thought about it.
那些我们所研究的观点
Ideas that have been worked on.
而如果与复杂性相反 我们能看出简单性和常识
And if on the other side of complexity we can read simplicity and common sense,
那就很好
that's great.
那是他所感兴趣的
That's what he's interested in.
那也是我们整个学期要讨论的
That is also positive psychology researchers
积极心理学研究者所感兴趣的
that we'll discuss throughout the semester are interested in.
与复杂性相对的简单性
The simplicity on the other side of complexity.
这两种简单性之间有很大的区别
And there is a very big difference between these two simplicities,
尽管乍看起来
even though on the face of it,
他们有时也许是相似的
they may at times look similar.
本课程需要的是一种非常不同的努力
What this class requires is a very different kind of effort.
与别的课程非常不同的努力
A very different kind of effort to other class.
它不需要你像55号课和10A号英语课那样的努力
Again it doesn't require the effort that you'll need in 55 or in English 10A.
它所需要的努力是一种应用的努力
The kind of effort that it does require is the effort of application,
努力把它应用到你的生活里
of applying into your life,
努力把行为的实际改变带入你的生活
of introducing behavioral actual change to your life.
在我们开始讲本课程的一些细节像教学大纲之前
And before we go into some of the technicalities of the class such as the syllabus,
我想先讲一个关于Peter Drucker的故事
I want to end with a story about Peter Drucker.
Peter Drucker 我之前引用过他的话
Peter Drucker, who I quoted earlier,
是现代管理学研究之父
father of study of management in modern times.
Peter Drucker享年94岁
Peter Drucker lived to the grand old age of 94,
是几年前过世的
passed away just a couple of years ago.
在他生命的最后当他头脑还百分百清醒时
Toward the end of his life while he was still 100% lucid,
活动和参加组织活动对他来说更加困难了
it was more difficult for him to be mobile and to go into organizations.
于是他邀请想咨询他问题的人
So what he did was invite people who wanted consulting from him,
想跟他学习的人来他家
wanted to learn from him to come to his home.
有国家总统
And he had Presidents,
总理
Premier Ministers of countries.
财富500强公司的CEO和他一起过周末
He had CEOs of Fortune 500 companies coming spend the weekend with him.
而在星期五 每一次聚会都是这样开始的
And on Friday, this was how we started with every session,
对每一个世界级领袖
with every world leader,
无论是商界的 非盈利机构的 还是政界的
whether in business, whether in non-for-profit, whether in politics.
他都会对他们说如下的一番话
He would say to them the following,
"星期一我不想听到你们说这有多美好"
"on Monday I don't want you to call me up and tell me how wonderful it was,
意思是这个周末有多美好
"-- meaning how wonderful the weekend was,
"星期一我想听到你们跟我说
"on Monday I want you to call me up
你们做了些什么改变"
and tell me what you are doing differently."
在这学期结束后或者在这个讲座结束后
At the end of the semester or at the end of the lecture,
如果你们喜欢它
if you enjoyed it,
务必告诉我你们喜欢 你们获得了乐趣
by all means tell me that you enjoyed it, that you had fun.
但更重要的是你们所做的改变是什么
But more important, it is what you are doing differently,
这对你们的生活有怎样的影响 而那需要我们的努力
how this has an impact on your life and that takes effort.
我们将用一周的时间讲改变
We are going to spend a whole week talking just about change,
和积极心理学一点直接的关系也没有
nothing directly related to positive psychology.
只是讲改变
Just about change.
因为改变是那么难
Because it is so difficult to change.
因为我们知道大多数组织上的改变都失败了
Because we know most organizational change fails,
因为我们知道更多的个人改变失败了
because we know more individual change fails.
除非我们在引入行为上的改变的同时 引入认知上和情绪上的改变
Unless we introduce behavioral change along with our cognitive and emotional change.
影响和认知还不够 还要有行为
Affect and cognition is not enough; behavior has to be there as well.
你所做的改变
What you are doing differently.
经常用不同的方式做事需要勇气
To do things differently very often takes courage.
一些你们要交上来的课后论文
Some of your response papers that you'll hand in--
都不会被打分 都只会有"及格和不及格"
none of them are graded; they are all just graded "pass/failed"--
你们必须交论文 然后你们就及格了
you'll have to hand them in and then you'll pass.
但一些也许是你所写过的最困难的论文
But some of them may be the most difficult papers that you've written here.
有一些会是最简单的
For some they'll be the easiest.
很自然地就能写出来
And things will just flow out.
那就是关于引入改变
That's about introducing change.
那就是关于反思
That's about reflecting.
那就是关于花时间接受
That's about taking time-in.
那就是关于凿掉多余的石头
That's about chipping away the excess stone.
而这只能通过这种努力而实现
And it can only be done through this kind of effort.
所以如果你真的想通过这门课改变生活 一切取决于你
So if you really want class to make a difference in your life, it's up to you.
我将会给你们介绍材料
I'm going to introduce to you the material.
我将会给你们介绍这个积极心理学的精彩新领域
I'm going to introduce to you this wonderful new field of positive psychology.
而取决于你们的就是接受并应用它
what is up to you is to then take it and apply it.
我想谈一下教学大纲及要求
I want to talk a little about the syllabus and the requirements.
我会给你们一点时间去问问题
And I'll give you a little time for questions.
但在这之前
But before I do that,
我也想对
I would also like to welcome--
我知道你们中的有些人正在家里看这堂课
I know that some of you are watching this from home,
对进修学校的同学们表示欢迎
to the extension school students,
很高兴你们能听我的课
it's wonderful to have you here.
有空过来看看
Do come and visit once a while.
而你们将显然参与到我们的课程中来
And you'll be working with obviously part of this class,
但也可以找Deb Levy
but also with Deb Levy who is the,
他是进修学校的助教
they had teaching fellow for the extension school.
Sean Achor是文理学院的助教
They had teaching fellow for the FAS class is Sean Achor
我想请他来说几句话
and I'd like just to invite him for just a few words,
向你们做个自我介绍
just to introduce himself to you.
而你们会被介绍给我们的其他助教
And you'll be introduced to other TFs we have.
我们今年有支很棒的团队
We have an amazing team this year.
这就是Sean
This is Sean.
嘿 上午好
Sean:Hey good morning.
能听到我吗?
Can you guys hear me?
现在能听得到吗? 很好
Can you hear me now? Great.
能回来再次为积极心理学做助教非常荣幸
This is absolutely honored to be back teaching positive psychology again.
Tal太谦虚了
Tal is too humble.
很荣幸他能给我们上课
This is not only extraordinary that he is sharing his time with us,
他还把家搬来了
but he's actually moved here back,
把家从以色列搬到这一整个学期
moved his family back from Israel for the entire semester,--
包括他的妻子和他的两个孩子 只是为了能和我们一起教这门课
his wife and his two little children just so he can teach this class with us.
对我们来说能和他们一起共事是个极好的机会
And this is absolutely an extraordinary opportunity for us to share this moment with them.
我真的很激动
And I'm really excited about it.
上一次我们教这门课时
Last time we taught this class,
我们做了一个调查 看看坐在这上课的都是什么类型的人
we did a survey to find out what type of people were sitting in this room--
他们就像你们一样
they are just like yourselves--
看看为什么你们会上这门课
and find out why you'll be taking this class.
因为我们得到的关于这门课的评价常常是
Coz the comment that we get so often about this class
为什么哈佛的学生会不幸福?
is why would Harvard students possibly be unhappy?
他们有什么可不快乐的?
what do they have to be unhappy about?
他们认为每个上这门课的人会上这门课
They thought everyone who'd be taking this class would be taking it
是因为他们已经很幸福了
because they are already really happy
他们想研究自己到底有多棒
and they want to study about how amazing they are.
他们想学一些能明白地告诉室友他们得意的东西
And they'd like to learn things that they can tell the roommates so clearly that (?) themselves.
但是结果是去年有超过三分之一的人
But it turns out actually over a third of people who took this class last year took the class
选这门课是因为他们感觉抑郁
because they felt depressed.
他们想学习积极心理学
And they were trying to learn about the research about positive psychology.
还有三分之一是因为他们想学会乐观
And another third because they wanted to learn about optimism.
另外三分之一的原因则完全不同
Another third did it for completely different reasons.
我想 今年还有三分之一的人选这门课是因为
I think. Additional third this year did it because Tal was on the Jon Stewart Daily Show.
Tal上了Jon Stewart的Daily Show 我很喜欢这门课
I am absolutely thrilled about this class.
Tal要告诉你们的教学大纲是...
The syllabus which Tal is about to tell you about is..
其实我们了解你们的一些其他事
Actually we learned a couple of other things about you guys.
你知不知道选了积极心理学的人中
Did you know that of people who take positive psychology,
有75%的人是俱乐部的干部5% of you are officers of club,
2585%是俱乐部的高层干部5% of you are the highest ranking officers of club,
这意味着 你认为哈佛有大约2000个俱乐部
which means that you think there are about 2000 clubs at Harvard,
你在一个只有3个人的俱乐部里
you are in club of three,
又恰好是主席
and you happen to be the president.
我们了解到你们不快乐的其他原因
We learned other reasons why you are not happy.
我们了解到上积极心理学课的人
we learned that the average number of romantic relationships
在4年里恋爱次数的平均数在0到1之间
for people to take positive psychology in 4 years is between zero and one.
265到1之间
Zero and one.
不! 我不信
(Tal: No! I don't believe it.)
不要走
Don't leave.
- 但那是在上积极心理学课之前
- 是在上课之前
- But that was before taking positive psychology class.
- That was before taking the class.
我们之后会调查一下你们
We are going to test you afterwards.
性伴侣数目的平均数是在0到0.5之间
The average number of sexual partners is between zero and .5.
我实在不知道0.5个性伴侣是什么
I have no idea what .5 sexual partners is.
这门课程将会很棒
This class is going to be amazing.
它过去就很棒 而且我们有一个很出色的教学团队
It was amazing in the past and Tal we actually have extraordinary teaching staff here with us.
很大的教学团队
It's a large teaching staff.
Tal实际上已经给我们布置了作业
And Tal has actually already given us home works
所以老师们不仅要学你们学的那些材料
so the teachers are going to be learning not only the material you are doing
和你们讨论专业的内容
and talk you about which the experts (?),
还要学习如何成为更好的老师
but learning how to be better teachers.
他给了我们要读的书
He's given us books to read.
他事实上给我们布置了任务
He's actually given us assignment.
从那个意义上说这是个很特别的课程
It's a big extraordinary class in that sense.
至于教学大纲 网上会有
In terms of the syllabus, it's going to be online.
Tal说现在我们决定要环保
Tal just described now we've decided to go green,
所以这门课程中不能使用树木制品 除了这个木制的大礼堂
so no trees are in making of this class except the large auditorium made of wood.
我们下周会在网上分组
Sections-- we are going to try sections online next weekend.
所以我们星期三会知道有多少分组
So we are going to get the numbers on Wednesday.
下个周末我们会做分组任务
On following weekend we will be doing sectioning
给你们的周转时间就非常少了
that gives you a very short of turnaround time.
如果需要的话 你们可以在周一换组
But that way you can give me Monday to change your section if you need to,
虽然我不希望你们改
which I hope you won't.
分组会在下一个星期开始
And sections will start the following week.
非常谢谢 如果还有什么问题 给我发邮件
Thank you very much. If you have any questions, send me an email.
好的 那么...
Ok, so...
我想我不需要跟你们解释
I think I don't need to explain to you
为什么这学期有一节课不是我教而是Sean教的
why there is one lecture in the semester that I don't teach and Sean will teach it.
而那节是讲幽默的
And that is the lecture on humor.
你们自己想想为什么
Figure out why yourselves.
我确实认为如果你想教什么你就必须擅长
I do think you'll have to walk and talk if you are teaching something.
教学大纲
The syllabus.
本课程 是向你介绍我关于这门课程的想法的
The class, is to introduce you to my thinking about the class,
是我所谓的
is what I call it,
整体的课程
integrated class.
就是指纵向的整体和横向的整体
What that means is that integrated vertically as well as horizontally.
纵向意味着每一节课都和下一节课有关系
Vertically means that every class connected to the next class
和整个学期内的每一节课都有关系 呈一个螺旋状
is connected to every class throughout the semester around a spiral.
所以我们下周所讲的内容
So what we'll talk about next week,
我们将在第7课 第17课和第24课里
we'll revisit it again in lesson 7,
再回顾一遍
lesson 17 and lesson 24.
所有内容在一个更高的水平上呈螺旋状互相联系
Everything is interconnected on the higher level on a spiral--
换言之 会带来深刻的理解和我所希望的对材料的吸收
in other words will lead to deep understanding and hopefully assimilation of the material.
所以是纵向相互联系的
So it's vertically interconnected.
同样也是横向相互联系的
It's also horizontally interconnected.
就是说课程中的每一部分都强调并影响另一部分
That means every part of the class reinforces and influences the other part.
上课还不够 你们在分组作业里面将收获更多
The lectures, not enough, you'll get a lot more in sections.
分组作业是强制的
Sections are mandatory.
你们要在你们的分组里做大量
You'll do a lot of work in your sections,
和你的课后论文相关的工作
very much related to your response papers
许多学生说这是本课程最重要的一部分
that many student claim the most important part of the class.
因为这样你们才有了练习时间
Because that's where you get the time-in.
这是你真正开始凿掉的时候
That's when you really get to chip away.
和期末的大作业有很大的关系
Very much connected to the final project.
期末作业是一个演示稿
The final project is a presentation that you'll write out.
你们不用真的做演示 但要向几个朋友演示以获得反馈
You don't actually give it but give it to a couple of friends just to get feedback.
那部分不计分
Not graded on that part.
期末作业是以期末论文计分的
The final project is graded as a final paper,
但只是你们交上来的
but just what you hand in,
你们提交的那份
what you submit.
为什么写期末论文 是因为像演示那样的最好的方式
And the reason why there is a final paper because the best way which is like a presentation,
因为最好的学习方式是教
because the best way to learn is to teach.
你们将把这些材料教给别人
And you'll be teaching these materials to other people --
任何在你的陈述中你所感兴趣的内容
any material that you are interested in in your presentation.
那么阅读
So the readings,
非常有关系 会把你们带到理解和吸收的另一个水平高度
very much connected and take you to the next level of understanding and assimilation.
在我讲完之前有问题吗? 你们有什么要问的吗?
So any questions before I finish up? Any question from you?
好了 那就让我说 最后一秒钟结束语
Alright. So let me just say-- one second finishing words.
对于能回到这里我感到非常激动
I am very excited to be back here.
我的家人对于回到这里也很激动
My families are very excited to be back here.
期望能和你们共度一个有意义的 愉快的
Looking forward to a meaningful, pleasurable,
令人享受的和更加幸福的学期
enjoyable and happier semester with you.
谢谢
Thank you.</p>
