幸福课 中英字幕 [第14课]过犹不及
各位早上好Dr.Tal Ben-Shahar:Hi.Good morning.早上好 很高兴又见到大家Good morning.Welcome back.希望你们都度过了一个愉快的假期Hope you had a wonderful break.恢复元气 释放压力That you took time to recover,to de-stress.这也是今天的主题And as it happens,this is the topic today.我们接着上节课继续讲We'll continue from where we left off before break.上回我们提出 事实上So remember we talked about the idea that in fact,压力不是问题stress wasn't the problem,这是压力研究最有趣 最令人惊讶which was the most interesting,surprising- but in retrospect,现在看来 也是最显著的发现obvious finding of the research on stress.压力本身其实是件好事That stress in and of itself is actually good,就像在体育运动中just like in athletics,just like in sports,我们给肌肉以压力 肌肉就会发展 增长when we stress a muscle,the muscle develop- it grows.我们心理上情感上给予自己压力 我们就会成长When we stress ourselves psychologically,emotionally,we grow.变得更开朗 更坚强We become more resilient.We become stronger.从小在无菌环境里长大It's not good for a person从未受过外界任何压力who's just born to be put in a sterile environment对人是不利的and be protected from all the stresses of the outside world,比如影响机体的细菌such as bacteria for example,which stresses the system.会使人体产生抗体Cause it forces to grade antibodies.所以长在无菌环境中对我们是不利的It's not good for us to be in a sterile environment,不仅指生理上婴儿的密闭环境not physically- whether it's in a closing environment as babies,缺乏运动not physically in terms of not doing sports,还包括心理及情感not pushing ourselves,and also not mentally and emotionally-所以我常常说 我希望你们遭受更多的失败which is why I said you know time and again: I wish you fail more因为艰难困苦Because I think it is important to go through hardships,能给予我们极大的锻炼through difficulties.结束"目标设定"的课程后And in fact,we are going to talk about failure就会开始关于失败的课程right after we finish up with the "Goal setting" lecture,我们会讨论完美主义when we discuss perfectionism,也就是对待失败的态度which is all about our approach toward failure.所以问题不是压力 而是缺乏休整So stress is not the problem.The problem is lack of recovery.不仅仅在哈佛 我们的文化中And that is what we don't have enough of in our culture-都对休息缺乏重视not just at Harvard.大多数办公场所 都没有足够的地方进行休整Most workplaces- there is not enough place for recovery;大多数学校 大学in most school,most universities- which explains所以压力转变为慢性压力why levels of stress translate themselves to chronic stress,变成了长期焦虑translate themselves to chronic anxiety,变成了抑郁症translate themselves to depression.00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,940就因为我们没有休整It's because we don't have the recovery.我们还讲了不同层面的休整And we talked about recovery on the a few levels-快速回顾一下so just a quick recap.微观层面上 休整可以是We talked about recovery on the micro level,which is,比如 每冲刺90分钟 就休息15分钟for example,every 90 minutes of sprint,15 minutes break-不要做马拉松运动员 要做短跑运动员instead of marathon runners,being sprinters.可以是15分钟冥想It's 15 minutes meditation.一小时的午餐It's a one hour lunch,给自己时间好好休整where we really give ourselves time to recover.可以是定期去健身房It's going to the gym on a regular basis.听15分钟喜欢的音乐It's the 15 minutes of listening to our favorite piece of music,与朋友聊天 等等speaking to a friend or whatever it is.这是微观层面上的休整The recovery on the micro level.上班时间进行休整的人...And people who recover,who have recovered during their work day-河对岸的Teresa Amabile和Leslie Perlow等人and this is research done across the river经过研究发现by people like Teresa Amabile or Leslie Perlow,如果工作场所能提供休整show how important it is in a workplace to have recoveries能使员工效率更高 更有创意and people who do it are more productive,并且长期来看 会更幸福more creative and in the long term,also happier.提高工作满意度Higher levels of job satisfaction.中度休整包括一夜好眠Recovery also on the mezzo level the full night sleep,每周至少休息一天the day off during once a week at least.放松休息以便重新投入工作Time off recreate so that we can create.最后还有假期 节假日 长假And finally,the vacations.Holidays.Longer periods.如果我们片刻不停的运作You see,the other thing that happens会发生什么when we are constantly on the run is that我们错过了身边和自身的风景we miss the beauty that's all around us and within us.错过了获得快乐幸福We miss the real potential for happiness,for joy,欣赏日常生活中美的机会for appreciation that surrounds us day in and day out.所以我们把一切都当做理所当然And that's why we take things for granted.因为我们没有花时间去欣赏体会Because we don't take the time to appreciate,to savor.这有悖自然And it's not natural to do so.你们能想象I mean can you imagine?一头狮子生活在现代世界?Can you imagine a lion living in our modern world?在麦肯锡或者投资银行上班Can you imagine a lion working at McKinsey?或者成为终身教授?Or in investment banking? Or being on the tenure track?这很反常 大家都知道狮子要打瞌睡It's unnatural.You know what a lion needs to do is yawn.要追逐嬉戏 这才正常They need to play.It is natural.还记得我们头几节课And remember what we talked about怎么说的吗during the first couple of lectures?人性中视野的局限性The constraint view of human nature-服从权力nature to be commanded must be obeyed.人的天性需要休整Our nature dictates that we need recovery.所有动物都是All animals do.如果我们违背心理或生理需求And when we frustrate a psychological,physical need,就会为此付出代价 无论是需要休整we pay a price for it,whether it's the need for recovery需要身体锻炼or the need for physical exercise,还是需要某种维生素或蛋白质or the need for certain vitamins or protein.我们会为此付出代价 关键是We pay a price for it.And the key is,将这种本能的休整期引入我们的生活to introduce these natural recovery periods into our lives.关键就是集中注意And here is the key.The key is focus.同时关注工作与休整Focus on both work as well as recovery.想一下我们节前提出的问题So remember the question that we asked before break.处于相同的现代社会 拥有相似的雄心壮志What makes some individuals succeed despite为什么有些人能获得成功?living in a modern world or living with ambition and success?他们知道Well these individuals know how to focus何时聚焦工作 何时聚焦玩乐when they work,when they play.97套句老话 他们努力工作玩得开心To use a cliché,they work hard and they play hard.具体是什么意思呢?首先 要休整What does that mean specifically? First of all,in recovery.他们明白多则劣 少则精They understand that quantity affects quality.我们来看一下诺贝尔奖得主Let me share with you a study that you read about in the book.以色列心理学家Daniel KahnemanThis is by Nobel Prize winner,进行的一项研究the Israeli psychologist Daniel Kahneman.他曾获得诺贝尔经济学奖 后来成为了积极心理学家Won Nobel prize for economics,turned positive psychologist.他希望研究一天内What he wanted to understand was the affective,妇女的情感感情经历the emotional experiences of women during the day.他让一些妇女在经历了某些特定事件后And what he did was ask women to evaluate their experiences对此经历做出评估:right after they had that particular experience:刚才的感觉怎么样so what was it like for you?这些经历包括工作And they evaluated their experience at work.购物They evaluated their experience shopping.与亲密伴侣 孩子They evaluated their experience共处的时光spending time with their intimate partners,with their children,与朋友共进午餐 等等having lunch with friends,whatever it was.评估一天内她们的心情They evaluated how they were doing during the day.结果令人惊讶The most surprising finding of this result was that这些妇女并不特别享受these women did not particularly enjoy time与孩子共处的时光they spent with their kids.这一结果让Kahneman很吃惊Now this result was very surprising to Kahneman.他和合作者进一步研究发现When he probed further- he and his co-authors:这些妇女并不是不爱她们的孩子it wasn't the fact that the women didn't love their kids.她们很爱孩子I mean they love their kids.对其中大多数人来说 孩子是她们生活中For most of these women,kids were the most meaningful,最有意义 最重要的一部分important thing in their lives.但是 她们与孩子共处的经历However,their experience with their kids通常并不愉悦 这是快乐的第二个组成成分often was not pleasurable- the second component of happiness.有意义但不愉悦very meaningful,but not always pleasurable.为什么呢?他们进一步研究揭露了确切的原因Why? When they probed further,they found out exactly why.因为这些妇女与孩子共处时Because these women,when they were with their kids,并不是真正全身心与孩子在一起they were not really with their kids,可能同时还打电话meaning they were on the phone at the same time,或者写邮件or doing email,or thinking about what they had,思考上班的事 或者要做的家务they did earlier at work,or what they had to do later at home.她们一心多用 并没有全身心与孩子一起They were distracted.And they were not present with their kids.单独来看Now individually,discreetly,她们可能和乐意与朋友讲电话they may have very enjoyed being on the phone with a friend,工作 思考工作or doing work,or thinking about work,或者等下要做的事or thinking about what they have to do later.这些活动单独发生可能很有趣Each discreet individual activity may have been a lot of fun.但是同时进行 就乐极生悲了But together,it was too much of a good thing.量影响质And quantity affects quality.听听这个类比I mean,thinking about the following analogy.听听这个类比Think about the following analogy.想想你闭着眼睛 全神贯注地Think about your favorite piece of music听你最喜欢的音乐and listening to it with your eyes close and focus.我最喜欢的歌是So your favorite piece of music- if it's like mine,惠特尼休斯顿的《我会永远爱你》probably is Whitney Houston's "And I will Always Love You".谢谢Thank you.Yes.英雄所见略同There's another one here with good taste in music.于是你听着惠特尼休斯顿的歌And you listen to Whitney Houston或者其他你最喜欢的音乐or whatever your favorite piece of music is.闭着眼睛 全神贯注You eyes close and you focus.然后从一到十打个分数Then you rate it on a scale of one to ten.绝对是满分十分And of course,perfect ten: you are touched.你深受感动 灵感迸发You are moved.You are inspired.于是又开始听第二喜欢的音乐And then you listen to your second most favorite piece of music,如果是我which,if it is like mine,会选贝多芬的《第九交响曲》it's the chorus piece from Beethoven's Ninth.你全神贯注地听着And you listen to it.You focus on it.然后从一到十打分And again,you rate it on a scale of one to ten.没有《我会永远爱你》这么高Not quite high as "And I will Always Love You",但也有9.5分了but it's a nine and a half.接着 为了达到最大效果And then,and then,for maximum effect,你把两首歌同时播放you take the two pieces together and play them.结果怎样? 19.5分吗And what do you get? A nineteen and a half,right?不 不是10分 连5分也没有 纯粹是噪音No.Not a ten.Not even a five.It's noise.这就是现代生活This is modern life for you.This is modern life.我们进行各种活动 生活中有这么多美好的东西We have activities; we have so many wonderful things in our lives但是又多过头了But we have too many of them.这会怎样呢?And you know what that often does?这常常会导致内疚 沮丧It very often leads to guilt and frustration.为什么 因为我对自己说 这怎么可能Why? Because I say to myself: how is that possible?我喜欢做这些事I love doing what I'm doing!生活中能有这么多美好人事物I'm so fortunate to have so many amazing,wonderful things,我真是太幸运了people,experiences in my life.但我竟然不快乐And yet I fail to be happy!我肯定有什么不对劲There must be something wrong with me.不 你没有什么不对劲No,there's nothing wrong with you.这正常得很 就好像你不可能It's perfectly natural,just like you will not be able to enjoy同时欣赏两首歌the two pieces of music played together even though即使它们分别都是你最喜欢的音乐individually they are your two most favorite pieces of music.过犹不及 多则劣 少则精Too much of a good thing.Quantity does affect quality.这种情况常发生You know,this happens constantly.两年前 我教授积极心理学时It happened to me two years ago就发生过when I was teaching positive psych.刚开学一个月It was one month into this semester,我很困惑 为什么我不快乐and it just didn't make sense to me: why wasn't I happy?教学工作很顺利The class was doing well.我很喜欢上课 同时还担任咨询顾问工作I was enjoying the class.I was doing a lot of work- consulting.在全国进行关于积极心理学I was speaking around the country及以色列的讲座about positive psychology,about Israel.写作出书I was writing and doing all the things that I love,做各种我喜欢在乎 充满热情的事that I care about,that I'm passionate about.和家人在一起Spending time with my family.于是我退一步 发现我"过犹不及"了And I took a step back and I realized "too much of a good thing".一旦我减少活动量And as soon as I cut the activities,幸福指数又重新提升happiness levels went back up again.多则劣 少而精Quantity affects quality.两性关系研究者Researchers on relationships and love,Hendrick夫妇认为the Hendricks couple (Susan & Clyde Hendrick),say,"爱与性与压力成反比"Love and sex are affected negatively by stress.如果我们能帮助人们简化生活If we can help people to simplify their lives,降低压力水平thus reducing their stress levels,it is very likely that那他们关系的将会大大改善people's relationships would be enriched greatly.更重要的是 他们生活中的积极方面Moreover,the positive aspects of their lives也会相应得到提升"would be enriched accordingly."它会影响我们生活的方方面面It affects every area of our lives,whether it's our love life,无论是爱情生活 与孩子共处whether it's our experience with our kids,工作 阅读whether it's our experience doing work or reading,与朋友共处 写作spending time with friends or writing.都可能造成过犹不及There can be too much of a good thing.所以如果我们把午餐作为休整So if we have lunch and we use lunch as recovery,同事还打电话 写邮件and at the same time we are on the phone and doing email,那就不是休整了 而是更多的压力that's not recovery; that's simply more stress.但如果我们只是享用午餐 享受美食But if we have just lunch and focus on our eating and enjoy it,或者只是与爱的人呆在一起 那就是休整or just spend time with people we love,that's recovery.专注是关键 工作也是如此The key is focus.The same thing applies to work.但是在当今社会Now it's not possible in our world today,尤其是处于领导地位certainly not in leadership positions你们很多人可能已经...或者将来即将体验which many of you already got or will assume in the future,不可能避免多任务it's not possible to eliminate multi-tasking.关键就是减少任务The key though is to reduce it.我们来统计一下 在座有多少人Just a quick show of hands: how many people here,从事需要集中注意力的工作时while you are doing work that requires concentration,无论是写作 阅读that requires focus- whether it's writing,or doing reading,或者其他什么需要专注的工作时or anything else that requires concentration-有多少人同时还开着邮箱的?how many people here have their emails on at the same time?很好 占大多数OK.It's the majority.几乎所有人都这样It's most people in the West that,who do that.我以前也这样 后来我读到了这项研究I used to do that too.Until I found out about this research.当你开着邮箱When you have your email on,从事需要集中注意的工作时while you are doing work that requires concentration,等于智商减少10 整整10分it is equivalent to taking off 10 IQ points.10 IQ points.我不知道各位怎样 但我可不能少10点智商Now I don't know about you; but I can't spare 10 IQ points.作为比较 如果你一整晚通宵Now for comparison's sake,if you lose a whole night sleep,36小时不睡so if you haven't slept for 36 hours,也等于智商减少10点your IQ is reduced by the equivalent of 10 points.另一项比较: 如果你抽大麻Another point of comparison: if you smoke marijuana,智商会减少if you smoke grass,your IQ's reduced by 4 points.所以如果你...面临选择So if you have- look I mean it's the choice-是要找乐子 还是降低智商 但千万别吸毒more fun,less IQ points.Well but don't inhale.希望你们没录到前面Now I hope you didn't record that there.Here is the study.伦敦大学进行过一项研究This was done in the University of London.上班时发短信的人The IQ of those who try to juggle messages智商会降低at work fell by 10 points,与整晚通宵的人一样the equivalent of missing a whole night sleep,抽大麻才4.4点 比这2倍还多and more than doubled 4.4 seen after smoking marijuana.听着 如果你关邮箱2小时Look,nothing will happen不会发生什么大不了的事if you switch off your email for 2 hours at a time.什么也不会发生 除了这种情况:Nothing will happen.Except for thing that will happen.你可能会收到另一条消息问:You'll get another message saying,服务器是不是当了?you know- the server may have been down or,你没收到我的邮件?so you are not sure you got my email.其实你收到邮件了Right you get those emails,如果一两小时内不回复if you don't respond for about an hour or two,对方就以为服务器挂了the server may have been down.除此以外 什么也不会发生But other than that,nothing will happen,即使你不回复if you don't respond to emails,即使把邮箱关个两三小时if you don't have your emails on for two,three hours.同样 就算你不是每个电话都接 也不会怎么样Nothing will happen if you don't answer the phone every moment.除非你是救护车司机Unless you are an ambulance driver,那还是开着电话吧in which case you should have it on.除此以外 都可以关了电话But otherwise,it's fine.Switch it off.少做点事 可以完成得更多Doing less- and when you do less,you get so much more done.创造力提升 效率提高 工作满意度提升Creativity goes up.Productivity goes up.Work satisfaction goes up265因为我们分心时Because when we are distracted,就会过犹不及there can't be too much of a good thing.我提到过很多技巧I've spoken about so many techniques already.比如记日记I speak about some more about journaling,表达感激 写感谢信about doing gratitude exercise,about writing a gratitude letter.今天我们还会讲到生理锻炼We are going to talk about doing more physical exercise.仁爱之举 等等We talk about act of kindness and so many things,but但是最关键不是要多做事really the key thing is actually not to do the additional things,而是少做 或者说是明确but to do less,or rather to identify the things that你真心想做的 然后坚定不移地执行you really,really want to do with your life and do them.因为多则劣 少则精Because quantity affects quality.人本主义心理学家Tim KasserTim Kasser,a humanistic psychologist做过一项关于时间充裕的研究has done research on time affluence.我们已经知道As we know from research,物质充裕对于我们的幸福感影响不大material affluence matters very little to our well being,基本需求得到满足之外beyond having our basic needs met,几乎不会影响我们的幸福感hardly even affects our well being.但是 的确会影响我们幸福感的However,what does affect our well being是Kasser所说的"时间充裕"is what Kasser calls "time affluence",这是一种感觉 我们感到时间充裕which is the feeling that we have time,感到我们能充分享受手头所做的事the feeling that we can savor the things that we are doing,而不是竹篮打水 做无用功that we are not constantly chasing our own shadow,东奔西跑 压力巨大that we are not constantly running around and feeling stressed.时间充裕的人And people who have time affluence in their lives-往往容易获得幸福感that is a good predictor of well being.这点我们可以详细介绍And that is something that we can introduce.即使现代生活Granted,more difficult in a place like this充斥着种种使人分心的诱惑where there are so many appealing distractions.我用了"使人分心"这个词I'm using the word "distraction" here,虽然这些诱惑even though many of these things对你来说可能美好精彩 意义非凡may be wonderful,amazing,meaningful things to you.但如果同时出现But when they all come together,很不幸 会让你分心it becomes unfortunately the experience of distraction.现代社会的运转常常与快乐对立You know modern world functionality is being pitted against fun.所以问题是The questions is如何让我们的生活 充满乐趣同时又正常运转how do you make our life fun as well as functionality,类似于当下与未来的利益which is parellel to the present and future benefit.我们知道要休整 重拾生活中的乐趣And what we know is that we recovery,fun recovery in our lives-听喜欢的音乐listening to our favorite piece of music and而且每次只能一首only listening to our favorite piece of music and one at a time;或者与朋友共进午餐or having lunch with friends与室友在家一起享用晚餐or nice dinners in our house with our roommates.当我们一起享受时光时When we savor the time together,不仅仅是快乐 而且有用it's not just fun,it's also functional.是正式休整It's also a formal recovery.问题是如何调和快乐与有用?The question is how do you reconcile? How do you do the 'and'?还记得积极心理学提出的问题吗Cause remember the question that positive psychologists ask:快乐 健康且成功的人士 是如何达成这一切的?what do people who are happy,healthy AND successful do?这一问题一经抛出And once they started to ask this question,就打开了所有可能性it opened up all the possibilities,出现了各种各样的回答all the answers came rushing in literally.其中一种回答是 聚焦工作 聚焦休整And one of the answers is- focus on work,focus on recovery.则工作效率更高 质量更佳You'll get much more done and much better.英语语言中最短的One of the shortest- or the shortest word-但又人人害怕的单词是in the English language and yet people are so afraid of it,"不"saying "no"-无论是对寻求帮助的人说不whether it's saying no to people who ask you something,还是对眼前的机遇说不again saying no empathically,or saying no to opportunities.因为我们对某些机遇说"不"Because essentially when we are saying no to some opportunities,对某些提议说"不"时when we are saying no to some offers,其实是对自己说"是"we are saying yes to ourselves.那如何选择对什么说"不"And how do we choose what do we say no to对什么说"是"呢and what do we say yes to? –很简单 问自己究竟想要什么By simply asking what do I really,really,really want to do.简化 宁缺毋滥Simplifying- doing less,rather than more.关键就是找到最适宜的简化程度The key though is to reach optimum levels of simplicity.因为过于简化Because we don't want to simplify too much就会走向另一个极端and go to the other extreme.和其他事物及诸多心理学显现一样You see,in a way,it works,as many things work,简化与效率是以曲线形式存在many psychological phenomenon work,in a curve linear manner.我来解释一下Let me explain.这张图表的X轴代表工作量So let's say we have a graph where this is amount of work.Y轴代表效率 创造力与快乐And on this axis we have productivity,creativity and happiness.两者的关系是这样的The way it work,the way it looks,is this way,meaning:如果工作量太大if our amount of work is too high,就会发生TBD 即忙碌紊乱症that's when we experience the TBD,Too Busy Disorder.我们会不快乐 缺乏创造力 效率低下We are unhappy; we are not creative; and we are not productive.精疲力竭This is the burn-out.也许短时间能效率和创造力能维持一段时间We may be productive and creative for a short while,但这点代表精疲力竭but this is the burn-out phase.另一方面 如果我们什么也不做 那也不好On the other hand,if we do too little,that's also not good.后果相似 我们会不快乐And very similar consequences- we are unhappy;没有效率 缺乏创新we are certainly not productive; and we are not creative.这点代表极端拖延This is extreme procrastination,我们马上会讲到which we will talk about in a minute.这点代表过度工作This is over work.我们要发掘What we want to find is our optimum-各自的最适宜点 每个人都不一样for each person,this is in a different place.有些人 图的位置可能靠这里I mean,this graph can be situated here for one person,有些人可能更靠前and here for another.但是每个人都会有个最适宜点But each person has this optimal level.这点代表了效率 创造力And this is where highest level以及快乐的理想状态of productivity,creativity and happiness is.例如气体再少也能充满整个空间So on the one extreme we have the law of gas也适用于时间管理方面essentially applied to time management.即使我们工作再少But even if we have very little work,它会占用我们所有时间it will take up all of our time.这样我们变得效率低下 缺乏创造力 不快乐And then we are not productive,not creative,not happy.另一方面是...我常常引用JP Morgan的一句话On the other hand,we have- the quote that I've used time他可以在9个月能完成一年的工作and again by J.P.Morgan,that he can do a year's work in 9 months但不能花12个月 需要休息时间but not in 12 and the need for time-off.你的理想值在哪里 这两者间你在哪Where is your optimal level? Where are you? Between these two.你得自己摸索 反复试验You need to find out.It's trial and error.期间会犯很多错误 没关系 我们就是这样学习的And it's a lot of error.And that's OK.That's how we learn.本质上 我们关注的就是可持续增长Essentially what we are about is sustainable growth.梭罗说过"要简单 简单 再简单Henry David Thoreau: "Simplicity,simplicity,simplicity!依我说 你要做的事应当是两三件I say let your affairs be as two or three,而不是成百上千件and not a hundred or a thousand;数上半打 而不要数上百万instead of a million count half a dozen...在这多变的文明生活的海洋里In the midst of this chopping sea of civilized life,云雾 风暴 流沙such are the clouds and storms and quick sands和许许多多事情都得考虑and the thousand-and-one items to be allowed for,他要成功 就必须是台出色的计算器and he must be a great calculator indeed who succeeds.简化 再简化" 这段话写于1840年代Simplify.Simplify ." This was written around 1840.那到了21世纪 我们还要如何简化呢How much more do we need to simplify today,in the 21st century?我们关注的是可持续增长And what we are about,again,is sustainable growth.这一比喻借鉴自环境保护论I've used this metaphor from environmentalism.什么是可持续增长? 比如塞内加尔What's sustainable growth? So when a country like Senegal想要进行可持续增长 该如何进行?is now talking about sustainable growth,what does it mean?这不是说他们停止增长It doesn't mean that it wants to freeze progress.而是指他们想要增长 但以一种可持续的方式It means that it wants to grow,however,in a sustainable way,也就说"对环境的损耗which means- "let's take out of the environment要控制在可以人工帮助下自然恢复的范围内"what can be replenished naturally through our help."与我们所说的心理学概念The exact same thing we are talking about完全一致on the psychological level.我们提倡的不是We are not talking about a stress-free life,无需奋斗 无需努力的a life when we don't take out of ourselves,无压生活when we don't push ourselves,when we don't exert ourselves.我们提倡的What we are talking about可持续增长是指when we are talking about sustainable growth is that我们努力奋斗 竭尽全力 给予自己一定压力we take out of ourselves,we exert,we stress ourselves然后通过充分的休整得以恢复and we replenish through recovery just enough397这才是可持续so that it is sustainable.因为如果不恢复 那就无法持续Because if we don't replenish,then it's not sustainable会出现焦虑 抑郁 疲惫and then we begin to experience anxiety,depression,burn-out,等等情绪and so on.所以问问自己 我的生活需要简化什么So ask yourself.Where do I in my life need to simplify?我的生活还需要做些什么Where do I in my life need to do more?也就是说 该如何克服拖延心理How can I,in other words,overcome procrastination?回到我们朋友那Going back to our friend.因为可能有点太极端了Because this may be a little bit too extreme.全国有70% 超过70%的大学生You know 70 percent,more than 70 percent of college students,抱怨拖延心理nationwide complain about procrastination.不是别人拖延 而是他们自己拖延Not others' procrastination- their own procrastination.另外30%矢口否认The other 30 percent are in denial.No.超过70%Over 70 percent.拖延与不快乐Now procrastination is associated with lower levels of happiness,生理免疫系统脆弱weakened physical immune system,压力过大等等都有关联 可能会导致抑郁higher levels of stress and could also lead to depression.虽然关联程度不高Not a very high correlation,但是两者呈正相关but there is a positive correlation between the two.幸运的是 有许多关于拖延的研究Fortunately though,there is a lot of research on procrastination其中一项研究很有帮助A research that can actually help.这项研究是由加拿大卡尔顿大学And the research is done at the University of Carleton in Canada,拖延心理研究小组进行的where they have an actual procrastination research group.我浏览了...And I went,I browsed them...你可以访问他们的网站 做得很不错You can go on their website- great website,还有许多有价值的照片and there are great pictures there.其中一组照片And one of the set of the pictures是来自他们年度的讨论拖延心理的会议is from their yearly conference on procrastination,该会议意义重大which is remarkable.这些是会议的照片So here are some photos from that very important conference.所有人于第一天抵达So on the first day they all arrived进行了聚餐and they got together for a meal.聚餐后 他们又吃了一顿And after they got together for meal,they had another a meal因为几小时后有人又饿了because they were hungry a few hours later.第二天 他们结伴出游 四处走走And then the following day they just hang out and walked around.校园风景很美It was a beautiful place after all.然后 一起吃了点东西And afterwards,they had some food together.然后 一顿接一顿 他们又吃了几顿And then,you know,food begets food so they ate some more.到了会议最后一天And at the end of the conference,他们觉得完成不少任务they really felt like they got,they accomplished a lot.实践了他们倡导的内容You know they practiced what they preached.于是拍了一张全家福作为结尾So they had a photo of all of them together right here.事实上 他们对拖延Actually they do fascinating work进行了精彩的重要的研究and very important work on procrastination.以下是部分结果So here are some of the results,如何克服拖延some of the important results for overcoming procrastination.首先 最重要的一点 很简单 容易实践且有效First,most important one,simple,easy to implement and it works他们称之为"5分钟起步"It's what they call "the 5 minute take-off".他们发现所有拖延者都有一个共同点:One of the things they found with,just about all procrastinator他们对行动的要求有所误解is that they have a misunderstanding of what it takes to act.全世界的拖延者都以为 要有所行动Procrastinators,the world over,think that in order to act,必须先受到激励they first need to be inspired.我必须感受到共鸣 才能开始编写经济学10号课程的题库I have to feel the vibes,before I start the EC 10 problem set.我必须有所灵感I really have to be inspired才能下笔写文学艺术论文before I write this paper for Lit and Arts.但事实并不是这样But you know what? That's not how it works.并不是这样That's not how it works.第一步并不是改变态度It's not about first changing our attitude,i.e.即受到激励 然后行动becoming inspired and then acting.恰恰相反It usually works the other way around.要先开始行动We first need to start acting,behavior,行动会慢慢地影响我们的态度that will then affect our attitude.因为通常行动开始后 我们会有惯性Because very often once we start,we are on a roll.或者有时候Or sometimes,a few times,在90分钟冲刺中during let's say the 90 minutes sprint,我们需要重新5分钟起步we have to restart the 5 minute.我不知道你们是否留意到了I don't know if you,if you've noticed this,but if you haven't,如果还没有 我想跟大家分享一下it's something that I really like to share with you.现在我们应该互相非常了解了By now,you know we know one another pretty well.或者你们非常了解我Or you know me pretty well.如果你们不知道 我想你们应该知道So if you don't know this,I think you should know this.我非常非常热衷积极心理学I am extremely,extremely passionate about positive psychology.我喜欢积极心理学I love positive psychology.但有时候 我早上起床But you know,sometimes when I get up in the morning,写关于积极心理学的文章and I write something about positive psychology准备积极心理学讲座or prepare a lecture on positive psychology或者阅读积极心理学文章 有时候我完全不在状态or read positive psychology,sometimes I don't feel like starting这让我太太大吃一惊You know,this is actually a very big surprise for my wife.那时我们刚结婚几年And it only came up just a couple of years into our marriage,我告诉她while I told her,"是的 有时候我都没心情起床""yeah,sometimes I really don't feel like getting up."她说"这怎么可能She said,"how's that possible?你早上起床I mean,you know you get up in the morning打开电脑 开始工作"and then you go to your computer,and you start to work on it."是的 没错 因为我了解5分钟起步Yes,exactly! Because I know the 5 minute take-off.有时候在90分钟时间段里And sometimes within a 90 minute session,我不得不再做一次5分钟起步I have to do another 5 minute take-off因为我感到精力不支because my energy levels are drained.所以要么花时间休整So either take time off to recover,要么我只是有拖延情绪or if I think that is just procrastination.我说没事 就5分钟 坚持住就行I say it's OK.For 5 minutes.Just push.这5分钟往往会让产生一个向上的螺旋And very often that 5 minutes start an upward spiral.不是通过思想 不是通过心灵Not through the mind.Not through the heart.而是通过行动Through action.5分钟起步可能是克服拖延The 5 minute take-off- probably the most useful technique最有用的技巧了for overcoming procrastination.换句话说 就是放手去做Just do it- in other words.奖励自己 你们都懂得生意是一点一滴累积起来的Reward yourself.You know businesses are built...你能想象没有奖励的生意吗can you imagine a business without a reward?就像是自动回墨Well,think about the self ink.你在从事某业务 想要激励自己You are in certain business.You want to motivate yourself.那就奖励自己So reward yourself.好了 我要工作3小时OK,I'm going to do three hours of work now,然后在食堂吃一顿3小时大餐and then allow myself a three hour meal作为奖励in the dining hall as a reward.或者我这周五要用功Or I'm going to really work hard on Friday这样周六就能出去玩了so that Saturday I can go out.没问题 我们做其他事也这样That's OK.You know,we do it in any other place.但不行But no again,我得受到激励 才能制作出题库we say no I need to be inspired for this problem set.也许有时候是Yes,sometimes.但有时候我们并没有得到激励But sometimes we are not that inspired.奖励当然也很重要And rewards are certainly legit and important.公布出去 破釜沉舟Go public.Throw your knapsack over the wall.告诉大家你的目标Tell people what you are going to achieve.我在1995年就是这么做的This is exactly what I did in 我第一次决定教授心理学专题讨论会when I first decided to teach workshops in psychology.我当时在新加坡工作I was working in Singapore at that time.我打电话给我的领导 Hugh Hang先生I called up my boss,Mr.Hugh Hang.我告诉他"Hugh 我想开一次专题讨论会And I said to him,"Hugh,I want to teach workshop.为时两天的讨论会 一天关于领导力Or two day workshops- one on leadership,另一天关于追求卓越与成功"one on the pursuit on excellence and success."他说"太好了And he said,"that's great.这会对员工帮助很大I think it will really help the employees.你想什么时候进行?"When do you want to do it by?"我说"7月1日" 当时是1995年1月I said,"July 1." This was January of 1995.他说"好的"挂上了电话 我是打电话说的And he said,"fine." Put down the phone,I called in...我当时在这里 是打电话给他的I was here at the time.I called him up.我一放下电话 就脱口而出"天啊And as soon as I put down the phone,I said,"Oh.Shoot.我干了什么?"我做过最正确的事What have I just done?" One of the best things that I ever did.因为我公布了目标Because I went public with it.破釜沉舟I threw my knapsack over the wall.不得不着手开工 无论我是否喜欢And I had to start working,whether I liked it or not.这帮助我克服了拖延And that helped me overcome procrastination.因为我知道自己想开设专题讨论会Because I knew that I wanted to teach at some point.一旦对外公布But when I went public with it,某种意义上 我就被迫去做了in a sense,it "forced" me to do it.后来我开设了讨论会And I gave the workshop.虽然不是1995年7月最棒的专题讨论会 但我办到了It wasn't the best workshop in July of 1995,but I did it.我准备得很努力 团队方法And I worked extremely hard toward it.The team approach.比如 坚持训练课程最好的方法之一The best predictor,for example of maintaining an exercise regime就是和其他人一起进行is doing it with other people.可能不是每个人都适用Now this is not right of everyone.有些人Some people-喜欢一个人进行训练exercise is something that they want to do by themselves,一个人听着随身听 或者独自在家进行just with their Discman or just by themselves at home.完全没问题 但是对大多数人来说And that's OK.However,与别人一起进行会有所帮助for most people,doing it with other people actually helps.书面写下也很有用...等于建立了契约It also helps to write down- this is a commitment.把目标写下来 分阶段进行Write down goals.Divide and conquer.一一击破Break down the achievement.还记得Langer的研究吗 把目标写下来Remember Langer's research? Write these things down.列一张表 对多数人来说很有用Make a list.It actually helps most people.最后一点 允许自己娱乐消遣And finally,permission to recreate.准许自己为人What that means is give yourself permission to be human;有时候拖延一下也未尝不可give yourself permission to procrastinate at times as well;允许自己休整give yourself permission to recover.你不是机器 我们不是机器You are not a machine; we are not machines.我们需要了解能力的范畴We need to understand the constraint of you of nature.否则就是违背自然Because if we don't understand it,if we don't respect nature,自然就会报复我们nature is not going to respect us,让我们付出代价 效率降低and we are going to pay a price,in terms of our productivity,失去创造力与幸福感 也就是我们终极货币our creativity as well as our happiness- the ultimate currency.我给大家放一段视频I want to show you a quick excerpt是我最喜欢的Ellen DeGeneresby my favorite,Ellen DeGeneres.这是一期有关拖延的节目的结尾部分And this is the end,the end of her show on procrastination,强烈推荐大家看看which I highly,highly recommend you.任意音像店里都能找到You can find it in any of the video stores around here.这期节目时长一小时 主题是拖延So here she is- the end of her show这是结尾部分after she's talked about procrastination for over an hour.唯一的The one and only.Ellen DeGeneres《此时此地》Ellen DeGeneres "Here and Now":我们想尽一切办法把事情挤在一起做We are doing all these things to squeeze things together以节省时间so we can save time.我不知道你们怎么样 但我时间不够了And I don't know about you but I don't have anymore time.我时间越来越少了I have less time.假设我们能省出一堆时间But let's just say we could save up a whole chunk of time空闲了出来and set it aside.然后拿它干什么呢You know what we'd do with it?什么也不做Nothing.Nothing at all.什么也不做 意义不正是如此吗Isn't that the point to be able to do nothing at all?但以后的一堆时间是无法保证的But we're not guaranteed that later on chunk of time.我们能控制的只有此时此地All we have is HERE AND NOW所以拖延的感觉才这么好and that's why procrastination feels so right!拖延不是问题Procrastination is not the problem.是解决方法 是全世界共同的表达It is the solution.It is the universe's way of saying"停下 慢点 你太快了 听听音乐"Stop.Slow down.You move too fast.Listen to the music.什么 听音乐Whoa whoa,listen to the music(杜比兄弟《听音乐》)(lyrics of a song by Doobie Brothers "Listen to the Music")."我的意思是 如果你今晚离开这时What im trying to say is if you leave here tonight不记得我说的任何话and you don't remember anything else that I've said,只要记住这句就行:现在就拖延leave here and remember this: PROCRASTINATE NOW.别拖延拖延 谢谢"DON'T PUT IT OFF.Thank you."好了 我教的所有课程中Dr.Tal Ben-Shahar:OK.Out of everything that I teach,这节课这一主题对我来说意义最深远this lecture this topic is the most personally meaningful to me.因为从许多方面 我的转变 从完美主义到...Because in many ways,my shift,my journey from perfectionism-这一转变仍在进行and it's an on-going journey,此时此刻正在发生a journey that goes on right now as we speak-从完美主义转变成追求卓越my journey from perfectionism to the pursuit of excellence这一转变与我的快乐历程is the most intimately linked紧密相连with my journey toward becoming happier.我想给大家讲讲So I want to share with you some personal things00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,930我的一些个人经历that I've been through.有些已经写在书里了Some of them are in my book.我想再扩展一下 不止壁球的故事But I want to expand this- the story beyond squash.我11岁开始打壁球So I started playing squash at the age of 11,放弃成为篮球明星which was after giving up an illustrious,这一前途光明 充满激情的事业passionate career as a basketball star.那时It was about that time我意识到NBA的梦想when I realized that NBA was not going to be a...无法实现了was not going to happen for me.我转而开始打壁球I started playing squash几乎每天都打and almost immediately started playing every day.当时我的生活围绕着壁球转My days revolved; my life at that time revolved around squash.每天早上5点起床 出门跑步I would wake up at 5 am in the morning and go for a run.回到家 吃早餐 上学Would come home.Have my food.Go to school.放学后 我会去打壁球Right after school- it was next to the squash,学校就在壁球场附近 距离不远not far from the squash court,I would go to the squash court,与教练一起练习 在健身房锻炼 打比赛play with my coach,work out in the gym,play games.一直到傍晚And then,late afternoon,才回家做作业 然后睡觉I would go home,do my homework and then go to sleep.好几年一直如此For years,this was my pattern.那段时间很苦 很艰难 尤其是间歇训练It was difficult.It was tough,especially the interval training-与教练一起锻炼work out with my coach.但是 这些训练强度与我心理上遇到的问题比However,it was nothing- the toughness was nothing compared根本不算什么to the emotional difficulties at the time.我不断受到压力I was constantly,constantly with almost no recovery,no reprieve而且几乎没有休整I was constantly stressed.我总觉得胃里有个结There was always a knot that I felt in my stomach.感觉很真实 就好像有个球在那里It was real,as if there was a ball here.每次训练情况不好The knot was especially pronounced,与我给自己设定的标准产生距离时especially difficult after a poor performance in practice这个结尤其明显 尤其难受when it didn't match to the standards that I had for myself.而距离几乎一直存在And it was almost never matched.比赛期间情况尤为严重The knot was at its severest during tournaments.经常 我闯入了一场重要比赛的决赛Very often,I would get to a final of an important tournament突然发挥失常 输了决赛and choke and lose the final,哪怕理论上能赢的比赛都输了even at times when I was supposed to win- on paper at least.那个结没有消失That knot didn't go away.就算消失 也只是很短的一段时间When it went away,it was only for very short periods of time.但我相信它会消失的But I knew that the knot would go away.当时有一个信念 一个愿望And I was sustained by the belief,by the vision,一个目标一直支撑着我by my personal mission at the time of winning要赢得以色列全国锦标赛the Israeli National Championships.我对自己说I said to myself,"如果我赢了 我就会快乐 就会平静"if I win this,then I'll be happy; then I'll be calm.一切付出都是值得的"And it's all going to be worth it."为什么 因为只有付出 才有收获Why? Because no pain,no gain.1986年 我闯入了以色列全国锦标赛决赛In 1986,I reached the final of Israeli National Championships但我输了and I lost.我身心交瘁I was devastated.I was devastated,虽然我是有史以来最年轻的决赛选手even though I was the youngest player to ever reach the final,虽然我击败了排名高于我的选手even though I'd beaten players higher than me on the rankings.我一蹶不振好几个月I was devastated for months.不过最终 我还是挺过来了 只有付出 才有收获But still,I went on- no pain,no gain.我继续刻苦训练And I continued to train and work hard.1987年 我在决赛中又碰到了同一个对手 这次我赢了In 1987,I met the same player in the final and this time I won.我欣喜若狂 从未如此快乐过I was ecstatic,joyous,happier than I ever remember myself being那一刻 我对自己说"付出终有回报And at that moment,I said to myself,"it all paid off.都是值得的It was all worth it.我会变得快乐"Because now I was ready to be happy."我跟亲朋好友外出庆祝I went out with my friends and family,and we celebrated.庆祝会后4小时 我回到家And about 4 hours later after the celebration,I went back home.我回到家 睡觉前I went back home,and wanted to,before going to sleep,想再回味一下just for one last time savor,enjoy that feeling of joy,胜利的喜悦与快乐of ecstasy,of pure bliss that I earned.我坐在床上 突然毫无预警地And I sat down on my bed and I suddenly,without any warning,完全相同的感觉 完全相同的情感the exact same feeling,the exact same emotion,那个结又回来了the exact same knot returned.我放声大哭 不是4小时前And I started to cry- not the same tears of joy喜极而泣的泪水 而且痛苦无助的泪水that I cried 4 hours earlier,but tears of pain and helplessness.那个结又回来了The knot returned.我想"也许这是高潮后的失落"And I thought,"well,maybe it's the high follow...我指望结会再消失It's the low following high." And I hoped it would go away.但它没有But it didn't go away.几周后And a few weeks later,我意识到它究竟是什么 这一次我彻底搞清楚了I realized what it was and this time I really nailed it.我明白了I understood.我要成为世界冠军才能真正快乐I would have to be the world champion to really be happy.高中毕业后I graduated from high school.离我入伍服役还有2年空余时间I had two years before I had to enlist in the military.我去了英格兰And I took off to England.住在伦敦In England,I lived in London加入了位于Ealing大道的Stripes壁球俱乐部and joined Stripes which was the squash club in Ealing Broadway,当时世界冠军Jansher Khan常常在那训练where Jansher Khan,world champion at the time used to train.因为我对自己说"这是我的目标"Because I said,"this is my goal; this is my objective."我每天都去俱乐部And I would come in every single day看Jansher Khan训练 模仿他and watch Jansher Khan and imitate him.无论他做什么 我都照做Whatever he did,I would do.他每天早上跑7英里 我也每天早上跑7英里So he ran 7 miles each morning; I would ran 7 miles each morning.他去壁球场 去健身房锻炼He would go to the court,work out in the gym;我都照做I did exactly what he did.他与其他选手进行无数场比赛He played numerous games with other players;我也与其他选手进行无数场比赛I would play numerous games with other players.他有训练搭档And he had training partners.当时我水平还不够成为他的训练搭档And I wasn't good enough at that time to be his training partner,所以只是偶尔去一次so I would just hang out there and once in a while,有时候 只有我们两人时 他会说once in a while when there was no one around,he would say,"来吧 Tal 我们对打看看" 于是我们会打一会儿"come,Tal,let's play a little bit." And we would play.每次与他比赛后 我都会从头再来And I went back to the drawing board after each game with him.更努力的打球 更努力的练习And I would play harder and train harder.因为要像他那样Just what he did- because to be like him,成为世界冠军 我就必须像他一样训练to be the world champion,I would have to train like him.我训练越来越刻苦 表现也越来越好And I trained harder and harder.And I got better and better.六个月后And after about six months,我的水平能够成为他的训练搭档了I became good enough to be one of his training partners.一年后 我成为了他的常规搭档And after a year,I became his regular training partner.我跟着他去了世界各地I would travel with him around the world.只要他有比赛 我们都会进行训练Wherever he would play tournaments,we would train before.但是 伤痛开始出现 为什么However,injuries began to creep in.Why?因为Jansher从三岁就开始锻炼Because Jansher had built up from,literally the age of three,他的耐力体格 都是日积月累锻炼出来的he built up his stamina,his fitness;而我 要么全有要么全无and for me,it was all or nothing.要么进行业余训练 要么完全不训练Either I trained like an amateur or don't train at all,要么像世界冠军一样训练or I trained like the world champion.我的身体无法承受 开始出现伤痛And my body couldn't handle it.And I started injuries.一开始 只是踝关节小伤 所以我休息了两天Initially,mild injuries- ankle.So I took two days off.如果膝盖有伤Or my knee started hurting a little bit-那就休息三四天you know,three,four days off.恢复训练以后会有一点不舒服 不过不严重Back was a bit uncomfortable.Nothing serious.我会继续训练 要么全有要么全无I would go back to training.All or nothing.要么不训练 要么像世界冠军一样训练Either I don't train at all or I train like the world champion.因为我想成为他那样Cause I want to be like him.就这样坚持了4年 伤痛时有出现And I continue doing that for 4 years.Injuries on and off.越来越严重 直到我20 21岁时Getting more and more severe,until the age of 20.21-医生告诉我"你面临一个选择the doctor told me,"you have a choice.你可以继续训练 打职业壁球赛You can continue training and playing professional squash,00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:08,500但你的背部会非常危险but then you are risking your back可能很快就需要动手术and you probably need to be operated on very soon.要么就放弃职业壁球"Or you can give up professional squash."怀着沉重的心情 我放弃了职业壁球with an extremely heavy heart,I gave up professional squash.放弃了我的梦想 申请入学 来到了这里I gave up my dream,applied to college,and came here.同样的模式又发生了Here,the exact same pattern continued-只不过以前是壁球only before it was squash;现在学术成了我生活的中心now it was academics that became the central part of my life.开学才一周 那个结又回来了The knot returned,very shortly after freshman week.因为每一篇论文我都力求完美Because every paper had to be perfect.书上每一个词都要阅读并总结Every word had to be read and summarized.每一次作业都要毫无偏差地完成Every assignment had to be executed immaculately.要么全有 要么全无 我不快乐All or nothing.And I was unhappy.在我大二时的某一天And it was on one day during my sophomore year.当时我23岁 我对自己说I was a 23 year old sophomore,where I said to myself,"够了 我身在名校"enough.Enough.Here I am,in such a wonderful place,有这么多出色的同学 优秀的导师with such wonderful students,such wonderful teachers.应该感到荣幸 但我一点也不快乐"Such a privilege.And I am so unhappy.我觉得这不是外部问题I don't think it is something that is external.我必须更好地了解自己I must understand myself better.于是And it was at that point that我转而研究哲学与心理学I decided to switch my concentration to philosophy and psychology希望了解快乐生活的意义wanting to understand the meaning of a happy life,了解如何才能更快乐wanting to understand how I could become happier为什么我不快乐and why I was not.很快我意识到And it was very quickly that I realized,我发现自己从事...that I understood that I was engaged,或者说遭受到某种普遍or suffering from something that is so common,且错误的观念折磨so pervasive and so misunderstood.完美主义Perfectionism.这就是今天This is what I want to talk about today,及下节课的主题and what I want to talk about in the next lecture.完美主义的概念This notion of perfectionism以及对完美主义的研究and what the research has to say about it.人无完人Now there is no perfectionist,没有人会处于糟糕的极端there is no one person who is on this extreme,也没有人会处于卓越的极端nor there is a person who's on the excellence extreme这点我等会儿会细讲which I will depict later.关键是 如何变得更快乐The key is how do I become happier随着我渐渐脱离完美主义 我变得更快乐了and I become happier by being less and less perfectionistic.完美主义并不是说要放弃志向Perfectionism is not about giving up ambition.我有志向I'm as ambitious,甚至可能比16或23岁时志向更远大or possibly more ambitious than I was at age of 16 or 23.而是说对人生历程It's about having a different approach对走出的每一步 尤其是对失败toward the journey of our life,采取一种不同的方法与态度toward each step of the way- specifically,toward failure.所以我要谈的第一点So what I'm going to talk about is first of all,先定义以便理解define it so that we understand it.因为它常常被误解Because it is misunderstood.我会谈谈完美主义的特征I'm going to talk about characteristics.我们下节课才会讲We are going to get to that next time only.特征...成为完美主义者代表了什么?The characteristics- what it means to be a perfectionist?然后我还会讲讲后果Then I'm going to talk about the consequences.以及如何保持成功与快乐的平衡And then,how it's possible to be both successful and happy.我们在目标设定课上问的问题Again,the question we ask in goal setting lecture,这一问题我们在课堂上会经常重复the question that essentially we are asking throughout the class-不是为了放弃成功it's not about giving up success;放弃日常生活中的金钱it's not about giving up the conventional currency.But而是更好地享受我们的幸福it's about also enjoying the ultimate currency more importantly.因为它是终极货币Because it is the ultimate currency.然后我们理解完美主义的源头是什么Then we understand what is the source of perfection;它来自哪里where does it come.因为如果我们了解了它是如何产生的Because if we understand where it comes from,才更有可能克服它we are more likely to be able to overcome it.然后 最重要的是 如何克服And then,most importantly,how do we overcome it?如何帮助别人克服完美主义And how do we help other people overcome perfectionism?不是让他们放弃志向 或者停止努力工作And again,not giving up their ambition,not giving up hard work,也不是消除失败时的痛苦 这是不可避免的not giving up pain of failure- because that's inevitable.而是获得一种更理性 更有益But simply have a more rational,a more helpful,更可控的处理失败的方法a more empowering approach toward failure.好了 我们开始前 我需要一名志愿者OK.So let's get to work.I need a volunteer.你们举手前 注意我的要求I need a volunteer,but before you put your hand up,我要一个很特别的志愿者it's a very special kind of volunteer.我需要一个很棒的艺术家I need a volunteer who is a very good artist,绘画非常出色a volunteer who can draw really well.不要有压力 好吗 要一个画画很棒No pressure here,right? A volunteer who can draw really well且愿意上来展示的志愿者and who will actually come here and demonstrate.要上台来需要一定勇气Now remember it takes courage to come up to the stage有勇气并不代表不害怕but courage is not about not having fear;而是害怕但仍勇往直前it's about having fear and going ahead anyway.有人自愿吗 有一个志愿者So do I have a volunteer? I have a volunteer.你上来好吗Won't you come up? (Applause)你好 怎么称呼 VincentOK.Hi.What's your name? Vincent.你是VS专业的吗Are you a VS concentrator?

I'm sorry.I'm sorry.I told...我说了 老师不好当It's tough being a teacher.You know it's...不过我想问你个问题 VincentBut I have a question for you,Vincent.非常重要的问题I have an important question for you.如果没有经过成千上万给失败的圆Could you have gotten to drawing a real circle你能画出这个真正的圆吗without having drawn hundreds and thousands of failed circles?换句话说 没有这两步 你能达到这步吗In other words,could you have gotten here without being here?当然不能 成功没有捷径Absolutely not.There is no other way to succeed.非常感谢 VincentThank you very much,Vincent.(Applause)学会失败 从失败中学习 这是唯一的途径Learn to fail or fail to learn- there is no other way.我是一名心理学家 你们知道心理学家干什么吗You know I'm a psychologist and you know what a psychologist do?心理学家观察人Psychologists watch people.你们每次进教室我都会观察And I watch you every time you come to class.非常仔细地观察And I watch you very very closely.知道我看到了什么吗And you know what I see?这需要极高的洞察力 经验及智慧Again,this takes a lot of insight,experience,wisdom,知道每次你们进教室 我看到了什么吗but you know what I see every time when you come into the class?我看到你们所有人走路非常优雅That you all are very good walkers.了不起Terrific.你们走进教室You know in fact what you do is you come in抬起左腿and you lift you left leg and then you just,踝关节微微往上 然后优雅地your ankle slightly is moved up and very gracefully-慢慢放下 抬起后脚的脚跟as you put it down,you lift your back heel.走得非常优美 非常优雅You did it so beautifully.So elegantly.还装作没有注意到And you know what? You pretend as you are not even noticing it.一边走一边与朋友交谈So the same time,you are talking to a friend.有些人还同时嚼口香糖Some of you are even chewing gum at the same time,连爱因斯坦都办不到just more than Einstein could do.然后你们又抬起后腿 如此优雅And then you lift up your back leg and again,so gracefully,稍稍弯曲膝盖 这一动作just you know,you bend your knee slightly.This action.同时挥动手臂 太美了And you move your arm at the same time.It's a beauty.然后微微扭动臀部And then you just swing your hips slightly.像这样You know just this action.你们有没有考虑过转行当模特?Have you considered a career of modeling?我是说真的 漂亮 然后继续走I mean really! Nice! And you put here.边走边说话 微笑Then you are talking.You are smiling.假装这一系列动作都是信手拈来And you pretend as if there's no effort involved.漂亮 你们值得表扬Well done! Yes! You deserve it! Absolutely!但是问题来了 如果没有成千上万次的摔倒But here is the question: could you have gotten to this stage,你们能走到这里to being such good walkers走得如此优雅吗without having fallen hundreds and thousands of times?连Vincent都不行Not even Vincent could have reached that stage without it.这是不可能的 学会失败 从失败中学习It's not possible.Learn to fail or fail to learn.我们小时候都知道And as kids,we know it.小时候And you know,我们摔倒了 疼的话可能会哭鼻子we fall down and maybe we cry a little bit if it hurts,但是马上又站起来了but we get up again.摔倒了 还会笑We fall down.And we laugh.来看个例子 有人在学走路In fact,let's see an example.Someone is learning how to walk.[视频][Video]去妈妈那Man: Go get mommy.去她那儿 去找妈妈Go get her.Go get mommy.太棒了Woman: Good job! Good job!SophieMan: Hey Sophie!能走回爸爸那儿吗 哎呀Woman: Can you walk back to daddy? Oops.把手给我Give me your hand.慢点 慢慢来Man: Slow down.Slow down.好紧张Woman: (Laugh) Yay!

Take your time,baby girl!慢点Mommy: Slow down.会走路了 激动吗Are you excited that you can walk?学习的喜悦Dr.Tal Ben-Shahar:The joy of learning.The joy of...这种喜悦上哪儿去了 去哪儿了Where is it? Where is it? Where does it go?它消失了 因为我们到了一定年纪Well it goes away because we come to a certain age开始意识到别人在看我们when we begin to understand other people are watching us,开始产生种种想法and then the image kicks in."我不要试 万一摔倒怎么办""I'm not going to try,because what if I fall?"或者"我不要约她出去 万一她拒绝怎么办"Or "I'm not going to ask her out,because what if she says no?""哦 不不 我不要演这出戏"Oh no no no.I'm not going to try for this play,万一没人看懂怎么办"because hardly anyone gets that.""哦 我不要分享经历"Oh I'm not going to share,万一有人不喜欢怎么办"because what if they don't like what I have to say."又或者"大家都这么聪明 我还不献丑了"Or "everyone is so smart.I'm not going to speak up."我们开始逃避而不是应对And we avoid instead of coping.这会影响我们的自尊 信心 乐观精神And that affects our self esteem,our confidence,our resilience,长期的快乐指数our happiness levels in the long term.约会时一切必须很完美Or we go on a date.And everything has to be so perfect.非常完美So perfect.忘了我们第一次学吃饭是什么样子Forgetting how we learn how to eat in the first place.学习失败 从失败中学习Learn to fail or fail to learn.这不是第一次约会的实在建议This is not actually concrete recommendation for your first date.恐怕行不通I don't think it will work.但记得我们是如何学习的But remember,remember how we learnt.别无他法 成长没有捷径 学习也没有捷径There is no other way.No other way to grow.No other way to learn.乐观 快乐 成功更没有捷径No other way to become more resilient,happier,more successful.我以前说过这个吗 这是我的私人祷文Have I said this before? This is my personal mantra我常常一遍又一遍对自己诵读that I repeat to myself over and over again,尤其是遇到失败especially after failures,especially before doing things或者需要克服恐惧when I'm afraid to do it,when I said出现"也许我不该做"这类想法时"well,maybe I shouldn't do."因为万一...万一什么?Because what happens if...? Well,what happens if?万一最坏的情况发生了会怎么样:我学到了what happens if is the worst case scenario: I learn.最坏的情况 很伤心Worst case scenario: it hurts.但我会复原But I'll bounce back up again.Rina事件后我也恢复了You know I bounced back after Rina.我能应付任何事I can handle anything.汉字"危机""Wei Ji",the Chinese character for crisis,由两部分组成:第一部分指危险has two parts: the first part is danger-是上面那个字this is the top character;下面那个字代表机遇the bottom character,opportunity.有失败的危险There is danger of failing.但有危险的地方And wherever there is a crisis,就能学习 成长,to learn and grow.Elbert Hubbard说过"一个人能犯的最大错误Elbert Hubbard: "The greatest mistake a man can make就是害怕犯错"is to be afraid of making one."我想给大家举个例子 有一个人犯过错I want to show you an example of a person who had made mistakes,失败了一次又一次who failed time and time and again.我甚至想给他授予In fact,I was thinking of labeling that person失败大王称号or giving him the position of ultimate failure.原因如下And here is why.22岁时 刚找到新工作 就失业了At the age of 22,already- just started a new job,lost it.00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:01,不是辞职 是失业Didn't leave- he lost it.23岁时 他决定投身政治At the age of 23,decided to go into politics因为其他工作他都不在行because he wasn't doing well in other jobs.但是也没有成功But didn't make it there either.于是继续回去经商 又没有成功And then he went back to business,didn't make it there.27岁时 压力太大At the age of 27,it was just too much for him.他崩溃了Just too much- and he collapsed.精神崩溃Had a nervous breakdown.但又重新站起来了But then got up again after falling.7年后 他34岁时And at the age of 34,7 years after his nervous breakdown,竞选国会议员 名落孙山he ran for congress- wasn't even close.没有成功Didn't make it.39岁时 他还没有学乖At the age of 39,hasn't learned the lesson yet.又一次竞选议员失败And he was defeated again for congress.他说"让我试试更高层的"And then he said,"let me go try higher."46岁时 真失败啊 还没学乖At the age of 46,what a loser! Doesn't learn,does he? OK.没关系 学会失败 从失败中学习Yeah.It's OK.Learn to fail.Fail to learn.你都46岁了 适可而止吧But I mean you are 46 years old,c'mon! Give it up already.到了47岁 他试图竞选副总统At the age of 47,he tried to be nominated for the Vice President还没学乖 又失败了Didn't learn.Didn't make it.到了50岁 他试图竞选参议员So at the age of 50,he tried again for Senate.他几乎想放弃了 但最终没有And then he almost gave up.But he didn't.到了51岁And at the age of 51,他成了美国第16任总统he became the 16th President of the United States.大概是这个国家历史上最有影响力总统Arguably the most important President this country has ever had.他谈起这段经历时说And through it all and he talks about it,"失败让人痛苦"当然 他的确有成功过"it was difficult to fail."Of course he had victories.我简化了他的生平 失败让人痛苦You know I simplified the process.It was difficult to fail.他不享受失败 但还是挺过来了He did not enjoy failing.But he persisted it.因为和历史上其他成功者一样Because he understood just like every other successful person他懂得throughout history has understood and understands:学习别无他法 成长别无他法there is no other way to learn; there is no way to grow.甘地 他自传的副标题是Mohandas Gandhi,the subtitle of his book is"我的对于真理的实践经历""My Experiments with Truth".他谈到了经历 尝试与失败He talks about experiments,trying and failing,尝试 失败与成功trying and failing and succeeding,再次失败 再次尝试and failing again,and trying again.你们可能听说过他在南非的故事Those of you who know his story in South Africa-他在南非进行的事业与之后在印度的非常相似he tried exactly or very similar to what he later tried in India.在南非 他经历了惨痛的失败In South Africa,he failed miserably.但到了印度重新尝试But then he moved over to India and tried there.经过无数次的失败And there after many failures,成功把祖国领向了独立he succeeded in bringing independence to his country.他比其他人更懂得失败的重要性More than anyone understands the importance of failure.不涵盖自由犯错的自由"Freedom is not worth having是不值得拥有的if it does not connote freedom to err."他指的自由犯错And when he talks about "freedom to err",是指国家层面上的he means it on the national level:人民能自主自由being self-determined,free people.同时也是个人层面上的He also means it on the individual level.我最喜欢的作者乔治艾略特My favorite author,my favorite writer is George Eliot.她原名玛丽安娜艾凡斯 后来改为乔治艾略特Her name was Mary Anne Evans,changed to George Eliot,因为在当时because at the time,when she published,19世纪中晚期mid 19th to late 19th century,妇女很难出版it was very difficult for a woman to be published.乔治艾略特说过George Eliot had this to say:"推动世界前进的重任"The

student here in the psychology department当时我还在读本科when I was an undergraduate.我还记得当时她在写学位论文And I remember when she was working on her dissertation,我们的导师是同一个人 我和...cause we had the same advisor.I was working...我俩的导师都是Richard HackmanWe were both working with Richard Hackman.她当时的研究是有关医院的 目前的研究也与医院有关And her work was,still is to some extent,in hospitals.她想研究如何才能消除And what she wanted to understand was how can you help eliminate或至少降低医院的失败率 为什么?or at least reduce failure rates in hospitals.Why?因为医疗事故一年会损失几百万乃是几十亿美元Because medical errors cost millions and billions dollars a year.更重要的是And much more importantly,许多人因为医疗事故而丧失many people lose their lives as a result of medical errors.所以她想研究这一现象So she wanted to understand this phenomenon并寻找解决之道and how you can reduce it.她的导师是Richard HackmanAnd she was working with Richard Hackman他当时已对有效群组研究了数十年who's been doing work for decades on effective groups.参加过心理学501号课程的同学应该认识他Those of you who have taken his class,psychology 501,know him.如果还没有参加过 不妨列为第一选择If you haven't taken his class,put it on the top of your list.他对团队和小组进行了多年研究And he's done work on teams,on groups for many years.他发现在某些条件下And what he found was there are certain conditions that如果人们置身于某个组织if they are put into place in an organzation,更有可能表现优异the group is more likely to perform well.某些条件Certain conditions.所以Amy Edmondson的论文想要证明And what Amy Edmondson wanted to do in her dissertation was show如果医院采取Richard Hackman的建议that when hospitals implement Richard Hackman's advice,使用Richard Hackman所说的条件when they have the conditions that Richard Hackman talks about,比如给予团队明确可行的目标such as a clear,engaging goal for the team,for the group,建立有效的团队结构such as an enabling team structure,及时的组织支援 高效的训练such as supportive organization,such as effective coaching.当一个团队具备了这些条件When a group has these conditions in place,就会表现得更出色it will not only perform better,这也是Hackman十几年来的研究结果which is the research that Hackman illustrates for decades,而且会减少医疗事故they will also commit less medical errors.这是项非常重要的研究 于是她着手研究了Very important research.So she did this research.花费了很长时间It took her very long time.进行实地调查 在医院研究She went to the field,studied at hospitals.经过很长一段时间And after a long time-在William James大楼15楼again this was on the 15th floor in William James Hall,我还记得她得到结果的那天I remember that- she one day got her results.把数据输入了统计软件 按下了确认Entered all her data into SPSS,pressed the button.两组统计数据And there was significant statistical difference有明显差异between the two groups.使用Hackman条件的小组The group that implemented Hackman's conditions以及不使用Hackman条件的小组and the group that did not.找到了 她欣喜若狂 几年的工作成果Eureka! She was happy,ecstatic.Years of work.她跑去了Richard的办公室 对他说And she runs to Richard's office,and says to him,"Richard 我得到结果了 在这里""Richard,I got it! Here are the results."他说"让我看看" 他看了一眼He says,"let's see.I want to see." So he looks at it.说"Amy 太惊人了 结果令人惊讶He says,"Amy,that's fantastic! It's very significant result.这不仅仅是模凌两可的边界了 太棒了"It wasn't just borderline.This is great! Fantastic!"他仔细阅读起来And he looks at it,and he says,"你确定是这个结果?""are you sure these are the results?"她说"是啊 结果意义重大"And she said,"yeah! They are highly significant!"他又问"你确定?He said,"are you sure?有没有重新输入数据再测试一遍?"Did you enter the data again and test it?""有啊"她工作非常有条理 非常努力"Yeah,Yeah!" She is very methodical,very hard working.她说"都核对过了"She said,"yeah,I did!"于是他说"结果的确意义重大So he said,"you know,these are certainly significant但事实却恰恰相反"but they are significant in the opposite direction."也就是说使用Hackman条件的医院Meaning the hospitals that implemented these conditions that反而出了更多医疗事故Hackman talks about were actually making more medical errors.这简直给几十年的研究一个大大的耳光Again this ? the phase of decades of research.不仅是针对医疗事故Never specifically about medical errors,其他很多方面也是如此but so many other related topics.于是他说"结果就是结果 现实就是现实And he said,"well,a result is a result.Reality is reality.我们得回到现场 分析原因We have to go back to the field and understand why.理解这一现象We have to understand this phenomenon."于是她从头开始 精疲力竭 衰弱无力So she had to go back to the drawing board- tired,enervated,不理解怎么会这样 又回到了医院didn't understand what happened,went back to the hospitals,很快就发现了问题出在哪儿and in almost no time,realized what the issue was.这些事故更多的医院 或医院小组These hospitals,or groups within these hospitals其实并没有发生更多医疗事故that made more mistakes did not actually make more mistakes.而是报告了更多的事故They reported more mistakes.事实上 其他小组虽然表面上事故少了In fact,the other groups,who on paper made less mistakes,其实发生了更多的医疗事故actually made many more mistakes.但他们没有汇报However,they did not report them.她是怎么发现的呢Now how did she know it?因为有些事故是无法掩盖的Because there are certain mistakes that you cannot hide.比如 很难掩盖一具尸体It is very difficult to hide a corpse,for example.所以这些大事故发生时So the mistake,the real major mistakes that were made,这些小组不得不汇报they were out,and these groups had to report these.并不是他们事故减少了It' not that they made less;而是增多了 只不过没有汇报they made more mistake but they didn't report.于是她改变了研究的重心And then she changed the focus of her research转向心理安全概念to the notion of psychological safety.心理安全是一种感觉 经历 空间Psychological safety is the feeling,the experience,让你觉得可以在办公地点 在组织内the space that you feel in your workplace,in your organization安全地讨论错误与过失where you are safe talking about errors and mistakes,01:13:28,110 --> 01:13:31,680让你觉得摔倒了也能安全地站起来where you feel safe falling down and getting up again.有心理安全的组织And these organizations with their own psychological safety,会表现地更好they performed better.当时是1999年 她与全世界各国研究人员And again,this was in 1999,a lot of research done by her进行了大量研究and people around the world,证明了有心理安全的团队组织showing how groups,organizations with their psychological safety他们的雇员不会害怕告密with their employees don't or are not afraid of whistle blowing也不会害怕摔倒 或犯错or not afraid of falling down of making mistakes.这些组织更为成功These organizations are significantly more successful.它们是学习型组织These are learning organizations雇员不断地学习成长with the employees constantly learn and grow.从错误中学习Or you learn from your mistakes下一次就能做得更好and then the next time you are able to do better.意义重大 影响深远的研究Very significant,very important research,无论是领导者whether it's for leaders,还是家长...你们中很多以后会成为家长whether it's for parents- many of you will be future parents.你们会不会为自己的孩子营造心理安全Would you have this psychological safety for your kids,让他们毫无约束地告诉你while they feel comfortable talking to you about things他们做的不好 失败的事that they did not do well,about failures.因为如果他们愿意跟你说Because if they do feel comfortable,they are much less likely就不容易进入害怕失败的完美主义to enter into this perfectionistic fear of failure.而会更快乐 更成功And they are much more likely to be happier as well as successful来听听关于Thomas Watson的故事This is a story about Thomas Watson,他是IBM的创建者 他至今仍旧founder of IBM,one organization that he invented and每天不断地改造它reinvented itself numerous times- continues on the daily basis.所以IBM能发展至今And that's why it survives.IBM刚成立 还在生产打字机时So there was an employee at the beginning when IBM was founded,有一名员工when they were making type writers,犯了战略性错误an employee made a strategic error.给IBM损失了一百万美元And the error was that he actually lost IBM a million dollars当时对于IBM来说这是一大笔钱and a million dollars at that time for IBM was a lot of money.于是他犯错后第二天So the next day,after he made that mistake,去找了创始人Thomas Watsonhe comes to see Thomas Watson,the founder,给了他一封信and gives him a letter.Thomas Watson打开信读了读Thomas Watson opens the letter and reads it问那名员工 "这是什么"and looks at the employee and says,"what is this?"他说"先生 这是我的辞职信"He says,"sir,it's my letter of resignation.""为什么辞职""Why resignation?""先生 我刚犯了个错"Sir,I just made a mistake给您的公司造成了一百万美元损失that cost your organization a million dollars.我不想...您对我一直很好I don't want...You've been great to me.我不想让您烦恼I don't want to put you是否要炒了我through this difficult experience of firing me.所以我主动辞职"So I'm resigning."Thomas把信撕了 说"炒了你?Thomas took the letter and tore it and said,"fire you? Fire you?我刚为您的教育投入了一百万美元I've just invested a million dollars in your education现在我要炒了你?"and I'm going to fire you?"无论这则故事是否100%真是 还是部分真实Now whether this story is exactly true,or almost true,在IBM公司广为流传it's still a story that circulates around IBM,在IBM公司营造了良好的氛围and a story that creates a certain reality in IBM,告诉大家"你必须尝试"a reality that says "you have to try".世界最成功的公司之一 强生公司There is a similar story in Johnson & Johnson,也有类似的故事one of the most successful companies in the world,Johnson将军where General Johnson,他与兄弟创建了该公司one of the two founders with his other brother,他们俩都叫Johnson 所以叫强生公司also called Johnson- just why it's called Johnson & Johnson.Jim Burke是强生公司的新人So Jim Burke was an upcoming employee in Johnson & Johnson,由于一个错误给公司造成了巨大损失made a mistake that cost the organization a lot of money简朴硬朗的Johnson将军was called in the morning一早会见了他by General Johnson who was a very austere,very tough man.Jim Burke走进他的办公室 可想而知胆战心惊And Jim Burke comes in,you know all shivering and scared.他走进Johnson将军的办公室He comes in and walks into General Johnson's office.Johnson将军从桌边General Johnson walks from around his table,走到他面前 说goes to him and says,"恭喜 Jim Burke 恭喜""congratulation,Jim Burke! Congratulation!"先生 我刚犯了个错"Sir,I just made a mistake,sir.""是的 我知道 这是学习的唯一方法"Yes,I know.This is the only way to learn.现在犯得错越多 将来越有可能成功The more mistakes you make,the more successful you will be.恭喜"Congratulations!"Jim Burke非常高兴 正准备离开And Jim Burke was all happy and about to walk out.Johnson将军又说"还有一件事 JimAnd General Johnson says,"oh,just one more thing,Jim:如果你再犯同样的错 我会炒了你"if you make the same mistake again,I'm going to fire you."这则关于失败的重要性的故事But again,a story that goes around Johnson & Johnson在强生公司流传开了about the importance of failure.而Jim BurkeJim Burke,by the way,成为了强生公司最成功的CEObecame the most successful CEO of Johnson & Johnson.Thomas Watson 马上就结束了 再给我一分钟Thomas Watson- I'm almost done,one minute,almost done:"如果你想提高成功率"If you want to increase your success rate,就要将失败率翻倍"double your failure rate."我们已经讲过这项研究We talked about this research.We talked about this research,天才的起源the origins of the genius- the most successful,历史上最成功的艺术家the most successful artist,最成功的科学家the most successful scientist in history are also the ones也是失败最多的 经历过最多的失败who have failed the most times,who have the most duds.爱迪生 达芬奇It's the Edisons.It's the Davincis.米开朗基罗 居里夫人It's the Michelangelos.It's the Marie Currie.最成功的The most successful科学家与艺术家 经历过最多的失败scientist and artist have also failed the most.还有 KlamAnd finally,Klam who did the...Jane Klam对节食成功Jane Klam who did research on people's success in dieting或成功开始运动的人士进行研究or people's success in starting an exercise regime,她发现最成功的what she found was the most successful people,有毅力坚持下来的人people who have been able to persist都平均经历过5次失败are people who have failed on average 5 times before.也就是说他们减肥5次 都没有成功So they have been on 5 diets and  haven't succeeded.到了第五次 或者第六次The fifth one,or the sixth one-才成功并维持住的I'm successful and I'm able to sustain it.运动也是如此The same with the exercise regime.学会失败 从失败中学习Learn to fail or fail to learn.周四见See you on Thursday.
