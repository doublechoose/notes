幸福课 中英字幕 [第10课]如何去改变
早上好 今天要讲的是变化Hi,good morning! So today's lecture is about change.今天很多事都会发生变化And things are going to change today.我们之间的关系会发生变化 敬请关注啊Our relationship is going to change today.So stay tuned.上节课Last time,上节课结束的时候 我们谈到很多种不同变化last time we ended by talking about the different kinds of change第一种方式 是渐进式的The first approach—the gradual approach,好像滴水穿石like water wearing down stone,要花时间的一点一点 慢慢的chipping away gradually slowly taking our time.第二种方式 是突发式的The second approach—the acute change,好像用大锤开山劈石the sledge hammer breaking stone creating a new pathway,凿出一条路 一个隧道a new channel.对于这两种变化 或是所有形式的变化The important thing to keep in mind with both forms of changes,必须要注意的是with all form of change,我们讲的重点是要将变化持续下去lasting change that is,which is what we are about.而不是突然一变之后又恢复原状Not just the spike and the return to base level.因此要注意的是The thing to keep in mind about change变化既不是药到病除的灵丹妙药is that neither is quick-fix.即便当我们举起大锤Even when we pick up that sledge hammer,就是这举起来的动作even when we pick it up,也需要我们在之前做很多准备的功夫we need to do a lot of work before the preparation.因此 举例来说 渐进式的变化So for example,gradual change,包括每天都做感恩练习slow change would be doing the gratitude exercise everyday,慢慢成为一个更容易找寻美好的人slowly becoming more and more of a benefit finder,逐渐的看到更多积极的事物gradually looking more at the positive,一点一点的构建起新的神经通路creating a new neural pathway neuron by neuron.还记得我们之前说过的两个重要概念Remember neuroplasticity and neurogenesis—神经塑性和新生神经元吗?two very important concepts因为通过了解和理解我们大脑的变化because just by knowing by understanding that our brain changes我们自身也将更容易产生变化that in and of itself makes us more likely to change.Carol Dweck做过相关研究And this is work done by Carol Dweck,我们之后谈到完美主义的时候还会提到她whom I'll discuss in future courses when we discuss perfectionism另外大锤的例子和探索经验是一回事And then the sledge hammer example is like the Eureka experience,真知灼见不是凭空产生的 而是经过the great insight that doesn't come in a vacuum.长时间准备后千锤百炼而得来的It comes after a lot of hard work after a lot of preparation.大家都知道所谓的灵感来自于99%的汗水You know the 99% of perspiration that leads to that inspiration.所以说 没有灵丹妙药 而且So no quick-fix.And the believe in quick-fix,正是那种对灵丹妙药的笃信和渴求the expectation of the quick-fix that is one of the reasons导致了今天抑郁症如此高发频发why levels of the depression are so high today,因为大家都很郁闷 很失望because people are frustrated.They are disappointed.发现灵丹妙药不管用的时候They think there's something wrong with them就觉得是自己出了问题when they don't succeed in the quick-fix.我在书里也写了 很可能他们认为But they have just,I just write in the book that it's possible."如果做完这五件事 我的人生就会美满了"If I do these five things,I'd be happy for the rest of my life.结果五件事做完 我却没有变得更快乐And I do these five things.And I'm not happier.于是我就开始怀疑自己And I begin to question myself.没有灵丹妙药 任何事都需要时间No quick-fix.It takes time.没有所谓什么"幸福生活五步走"No five easy steps to happiness.在我们讲变化过程之前Before we go to the change process,我们先要理清一些概念there are a few things we need to understand.首先我们要问的是The first thing to understand is this.我 或者你 真的想要改变吗?Do I,do you really want to change?我是不是真的想要改善我的个性Do I really want to improve certain things in my personality…或者我不喜欢的性格或行为 things that… or character,or behavior,things that I don't like.这不是一个无关紧要的问题And it's not a trivial question.也不是象征性地问自己一下It is not a rhetorical question因为表面上我们可能会说当然了because very often on the conscious level we maybe saying yes,但是潜意识里却有东西在阻挠我们but on the subconscious level something is stopping us.我给大家举个例子吧Let me show you an example.早在80年代的时候 LangerSo this is the study done by Langer and,和Thompson曾做过一个实验and Thompson back in the 80s.这个实验是这样的And here is what they did.他们找来一些学生或参与实验的人They brought students in or participants in.然后问这些人And they asked them64他们想不想要摆脱自己性格的某个方面whether they wanted to get rid of certain characteristics,比如说古板 或者容易轻信别人like rigidity,or being gullible,or grimness.或是冷酷 他们问这些人And they asked them想不想要摆脱这些性格whether they wanted to get rid of these characteristics想不想在这方面变的更好and whether they succeeded in becoming better in this area.是不是真的能改变自己 即是说Were you able to introduce change,如果改变对于你来说真的很重要so were you able to actually become less rigid,那你能不能最终变得不那么古板if this was important for you to change,不那么容易轻信别人 不那么冷酷or less gullible,or less grim?这就是他们最初问的两个问题So this is the first two questions that they asked.想不想改善 想不想改变Did you want to improve it? Did you wanna change this?第二个问题 能不能改变The second question – were you successful?然后 在他们问了这些问题之后And then after they answered these questions,77实验还有第二个阶段 在这个阶段there was the second part of the study他们让这些人去评估where they asked them to evaluate the positive,评估下列正面性格 比如the,the following positive characteristics.言行一致对于你来说是否重要Consistency,is it important to you?值得信赖 是不是重要Is it important to you to be trustworthy?以及 被认为是一个严肃认真的人And how important it is for you对于你来说有多重要to be and to be perceived as a serious person?下面我们来说这个实验的有趣的结果And here is the interesting finding of this research.所有给这些正面性格打高分的人Those individuals who rated the positive traits,这些黄色的是正面性格the ones in yellow,who rated them high,认为这些性格很重要的人as personally important to them反而比较不容易去改变自己的负面性格were less likely to change the negatives.大家明白这其中的奥妙么?Do you understand implications of the study?也就是说 比如 So what is saying is that…我想要摆脱古板的个性Let's say I do wanna get rid of rigidity.我不喜欢自己那么古板I don't like being rigid.但是 与此同时However at the same time言行一致在我看来是非常重要的品格consistency is a very important value to me.我反而不容易去改变自己的古板I'm less likely to change my rigidity因为在我的意识里 它们是相互关联的because they are associated in my mind.对 我不想要古板下去了And yeah,I don't want to be rigid.同时我潜意识里有个小人却在说But at the same time subconscious talking here.我想要言行一致I want to be consistent.别摆脱古板 因为我把两者结合起来了Don't let go of this rigidity because I couple them,我把两者联系在一起了I associate them together.因此不想舍其一Not wanting to get rid of one因为我不想把婴儿和洗澡水一起倒掉because I don't want the baby out with the bath water.对于我来说两者是紧密相连的And to me they are linked.同理 还有轻信和值得信赖The same with gullibility and trustworthiness.这两种品质 可以说 值得信赖的人We can say that另一方面很容易轻信别人 这种性格the other side of gullibility someone who's trustworthy.极端化以后 人会变得容易轻信别人Now going to the extreme.I become gullible.然而 我却不想丢掉轻信别人的习惯However I don't get rid of my gullibility因为同时我不想丢掉我值得信赖的优点because I don't want to also get rid of my trustworthiness.同样的例子还有冷酷 我的冷酷Same with grim.I may be grim可能在潜意识里正反映出我的严肃认真but that's also subconsciously a sign of my seriousness.很多年来 真的是很久以来You know for years,literally years,我在思考分析 并写了很多when I've been thinking and writing关于完美主义的东西and analyzing the notion of perfectionism,我不能理解为什么我自身的情况I couldn't understand why it didn't get better,长久以来并未好转for very long time.因为我知道自己深受完美主义其害Because I knew perfectionism was hurting me,我读了研究报告 反省个人经历I read the research,I look through personal experiences.我知道完美主义对我百害无益 有损于我的健康I knew it was hurting me in terms of my well-being for sure,从长远来看 也阻挠我成功but also in the long term in terms of my success.And但是我却摆脱不了它 直到我读了这个报告yet I couldn't get rid of perfectionism until I read the study.于是 我问自己And I asked myself,'OK 与完美主义相对应的是什么呢'‘OK,so what is the counterpart to perfectionism?在我的意识里 它和什么联系在一起?What's tied in my mind?完美主义和什么密切相联呢?What goes hand in hand for me with perfectionism?’和它密切相联的是动力和雄心What goes hand in hand is drive and ambition.如果我需要自我定义的话 首先要做的And if I had to define myself,this is one of the first things定义就是我有动力和雄心抱负that I would define myself as I'm driven and I'm ambitious.同时因为我不想失去这些品格And because I didn't want to lose these characteristics,我的潜意识便阻止我my subconscious didn't let me,摆脱对完美主义的追求stopped me from getting rid of the perfectionism,我对完美主义的定义是perfectionism which I define as a debilitating fear of failure,对失败的极度恐惧 失败会阻止我们failure that prevents us…我们会用整整一周来讲完美主义we'll have a whole week on perfectionism.到时候会讲的更深入一些So we'll get more in depth if you'll understand what it means.只有当我明白了这两者之间And it was only once I understood的密切关联that for me these two things go hand in hand,我才能够把它们拆开 分开I was able to unpack them,to distinguish them.我只想保留其一I said I want to keep one not the other.再比如 担忧和焦虑Or for example,worry and anxiety.其实我已经说过很多次了Look I've mentioned these many times before,我最终摆脱了焦虑的困扰next time I'll talk to you about the process下次我会和大家说说具体的过程that I underwent to overcome anxiety.自从很久以前开始Part of me since the time I can't remember myself.我上大学的时候 每当有壁球比赛也好Being anxious whether it's before matches in squash,或者是考试也好whether it's before exams,或是在分组讨论的时候发言之前whether it's before speaking up in section我都会非常焦虑when I was an undergrad.我不想再这样下去了 我不想要焦虑And I wanted to stop that.I didn't want that.然而 我却丢不掉这种担忧和焦虑However,I didn't let go of worry and anxiety因为我同时很重视责任感because I also sort with responsibility.如果我会焦虑 说明我有责任感Well if I'm anxious,it can mean I'm responsible.我会在上课前更认真的做准备So I prepare for class much more而不是随便糊弄 偷懒as opposed to just let go and become a slacker.因此我把焦虑和正面品格责任感联系起来So I associated a positive trait which is responsibility.还记得关于Brandon的故事吗And remember Brandon? No one is coming?责任感是非常重要的品质Very important trait,responsibility.但是它却阻挠我摆脱担忧和焦虑But that prevented me from letting go.这都是在潜意识里发生的Subconscious level,我之前并没有意识到这些not conscious of the worry and anxiety that I often experienced.还有 罪恶感Guilt.有好的罪恶感 也有不好的罪恶感Again there is good guilt,there is bad guilt You know,it is.我不想摆脱罪恶感 因为Well,I don't want to get rid of guilt because what that means我不想变得对他人冷漠无情I'm not being empathic and sensitive toward other people.我们经常会把这两者联系起来Very often we connect the two..They go hand in hand.还有一对概念 是精简化Another couple is the notion of simplifying.这也是我的切身体会This is something very personal to me.我想要减少工作量 因为I wanted to do less because我明白同时参与太多活动 有损于I knew that taking on too many activities was actually hurting me有损于我的工作效率 创造力和健康was hurting my productivity,creativity,well-being.但是我却没办法做到精简I couldn't simplify.为什么呢 因为我将它和失去优势联系起来Why? Because I associate it in my mind with losing my edge.所以我没办法做到精简So I didn't let go.还有我们上周谈到的寻找过错Or fault-finding,we talked about this a week ago.为什么人们不能停止寻找过错呢?Why do people not let go of  fault-finding?为什么要维持悲观的态度呢Why do they remain pessimistic?因为他们把寻找过错和现实主义联系起来Because they connect it with the sense of realism.我不想放弃这种现实的态度I don't wanna stop being realisic.不想变成一个脱离现实盲目乐观的人I don't wanna be one of those detached Pollyannas.因此我不会放弃寻找过错的习惯And therefore I don't let go of my fault-finding.幸福Happiness.通往幸福路上最大的障碍One of the most significant barrier to people's happiness就是人们把幸福和偷懒联系在一起is that they associate happiness with slacking off,因为当今文化中最为人所追捧because the dominant paradigm,所信奉的真理就是"没有付出就没有回报"the dominant mantra in our culture today is ‘no pain,no gain.'如果我现在很快乐 就意味着我不再经历痛苦If I'm happy now,I ignore experiencing pain.就意味着我放弃了It means I'm letting go.意味着我不会成功It means I'm not gonna be successful.意味着我已经失去了棱角It means I'm gonna lose my edge.意味着我不再有动力和雄心It means I'm gonna lose my drive and ambition.所以我们在潜意识里选择不快乐So our subconscious prefers to keep,keep us unhappy,这样的话 我们就不会失去其它珍贵的东西so that we don't lose the other things that we value highly,194比如雄心壮志 比如长处优势things such as ambition,things such as having an edge,比如勤奋刻苦things such as our hard work.当然 依我们现在来看Now of course when we look at them我们知道这些东西并不是密不可分的we know that they don't necessarily have to go hand in hand.正相反 比如说 快乐On the contrary,for example,happiness,我们从"拓延-建构"理论中学到we know from the broaden and build theory,the positive emotions正面的情绪是和成功联系在一起的are actually associated with higher levels of success.等到春假之后 当我们讲到完美主义的时候Whereas I'll talk about after spring break,我会讲一些when we talk about perfectionism.从研究中得来的理论We know from research,大家可以把这些理论和你们个人联系起来you'll be able to connect it also in the person.你们中间有很多人会发现可以Many of you will be able to connect it in the personal level.将其和自身联系起来We know that letting go of this fear of failure and coping,如果我们能赶走对失败的恐惧 学会面对它putting ourselves on the line more,学会冒险 从失败中学习经验learning from failures looking at it as a,as a stepping stone将失败看作是未来成功路上的垫脚石that contributes to our success in the long term.这些都不意味着我们会相应的It doesn't need to take away from our drive失去动力和雄心抱负and ambition on the contrary.克服对失败的恐惧 或担忧焦虑And the key if we wanna overcome this fear of failure或罪恶感 或种种不幸福的关键or the worry/anxiety,or the guilt,or the slack of happiness,通常 不一定总是 而是通常是关于理解it's very often,not always,very often about understanding,或更好的去理解这些品格的含义or getting a better understanding of these characteristics.举个例子For example,要理解 我想要摆脱对失败的恐惧感understanding that I want to let go of my fear of failure,不是一般的恐惧 而是消磨人意志的恐惧the debilitating fear of failure,not just fear of failure因为每个人都在某种程度上害怕失败because every one is afraid of failure to some extent.但是要摆脱这种消磨人意志的恐惧But to let go of the debilitating fear of failure同时保存我的动力和雄心and yet maintain my drive/ambition.就必须要理解两者是密不可分的So more in nuance understanding that you need to go hand in hand.又或者 你们知道Or,I can't,you know,我以前不会对人说不I never used to be able to say no to people.这么短小的一个词 简单的一个词You know,such a short word,such an easy word,有时候是那么难以说出口so difficult at times to say.为什么?因为我眼中的自己和我希望Why? Because I see myself and now I want other people to see me别人眼中的自己是有同情心的as empathic as sensitive as under..as a nice guy.善解人意的 是老好人 于是And then I unpack the two.我把两者拆开了 它们并不一定要And it really doesn't have to hand in hand.连在一起 我可以善解人意的说不I can say no to people very sensitively因为很多时候当我对别人说好because very often when I say yes to others,我其实同时在对自己说不I'm saying no to myself,and in the long term,从长远来看 也是在对亲密关系说不very often to the relationship.所以现在我更好更深入的了解了So now I had a better more nuance understanding of我什么时候能说不 什么时候不想说when I can say no and when I don't want to say no同时 我还能保留自己的善解人意while maintaining my sensitivity and my empathy和同情心 也不必在每次说不的时候without experiencing the same levels of guilt感到有种罪恶感that I experienced before whenever I said no.这里列出来的每种品格And the same you can do for everyone of these,都是可以被拆开的of these characteristics.大家可以想想有哪些品性So think about what if you wanted to change for a very long time是你很久以前就想改掉 却改不掉的and weren't successful in.对完美主义的追求?Was it perfectionism?还是严酷无情?Was it,you know this very serious grimness?还是你想变得更顽皮活泼?And you wanted to be more playful?也许你并不想摆脱这种个性Well maybe you didn't want to get rid of it因为害怕自己会失去严肃认真的品性because you were afraid of losing you seriousness.其实你根本不需要失去And you don't need do.把婴儿留下 把洗澡水倒掉The baby can stay,the bath water can go前提是我们能搞清楚if we have a more nuance understanding of我们到底想改变什么what it is we want to change.下周的小组讨论活动 你们要和助教In section next week,you are going to do an exercise一起做一个叫完成句子的练习with your teaching fellows called sentence completion.下面要说的正是你们在练习中要做的事In that exercise,this is exactly what you are going to do.你们要识别...You're going to identify..这个练习是Nathaniel Branden设计的It's,,,it's an exercise devised by Nathaniel Branden.它将帮助你识别You're going to do an exercise that will help you identify自己分别想要摆脱和保留的品格what you wanna get rid of and what you wanna keep.很多时候 不管在显意识还是潜意识中Very often,that,just that switch that you make in your mind,都有一个你自己制作的开关subconscious as well as conscious mind可以引发洪水 打开通往新隧道的大门can open the flood waters,the gates to a new channel,大脑里新的通路 真正永久性的变化new pathway in our brain,real lasting change.我们现在要讨论三个截然不同We're gonna discuss three distinct..却又相互连结的通向变化的途径the interconnected pathways to change—这就是我们之前提过的 心理学ABC理论the ABCs of psychology which we have mentioned before.ABC理论 A代表情感 情绪The ABCs,the A is the affect,the emotion.B代表行为 行动The B is the behavior,the action.C代表认知 思维And C is the cognition,the thought.我们今天要做的是And what we gonna do is我们会分别讲这三个元素we're going to talk about each one of the three.在分别讲这三个元素的时候And for each one we're going to talk about我们会谈到渐进式变化和突发式变化the gradual change approach and the acute change approach.可以说 我们用两种方法解释三元素So in a sense we're building a three by two.情感 行为 认知 乘以渐进式和突发式Affect,behavior,cognition times gradual and the acute.一共有六种变化的方式 这六种方式And we're going to talk about six different approaches to change.彼此相通 把它们联系起来很重要These six approaches to change are interconnected.我们希望能三者兼得It's important to connect them.And ideally we want all three.为什么呢? 引用一句我们提过多次Why? Quote it up,we used it a few times and we'll use it again,以后也会再提的名言 Dryden和Poet说的John Dryden,British poet,"我们养成习惯;习惯造就我们"“we first make our habit and then our habits make us.”为了能改变习惯 产生永久性的变化In order to change habit,in order to bring about lasting change,我们不仅需要一种稳定的变化模式we need to have as much of a solid approach as much..um..也同样需要一种外部介入的力量force in the intervention.仅仅把注意力放在情感上是不够的It's not just enough to focus on the emotions.放在行动上也是不够的It's not just enough to focus on action.放在思维上也是不够的It's not enough just to focus on our thinking.我们要对三元素同时下功夫We want to focus on the three.A B和C三元素The A,the B and the C.大家可以想想看It's ..Think about it.就好象 我们把习惯看成一股洪流It's like a habit can be looked as a flood.一股我们思维的洪流 这股洪流是There's flood in our mind由来自不同通路的神经元构成的of certain neurons firing in certain neuron pathway.我们现在要做的是对抗这股洪流And what we want to do is to overcome this flood.为了做到这点 我们需要足够大的外力And to overcome this flood we need as much force as we can,因此我们要尝试尽可能多的方法therefore we want to use as many approaches as we can.在我们讲A元素之前Before we jump into the A,我再问一个问题 我们想改变什么?one more thing -- what do we want to change?我们能改变什么?不能改变什么?What can we change? And what can we not change?以Lyubomirsky Diener等人为首的So according to researchers led by the lights of研究者宣称 快乐是由三部分构成的Sonja Lyubomirsky,Ed Diener,happiness comprises…在我们试图分析一个人的幸福感时as we're to explain an individual's happiness,我们需要研究三个因素we need to look at the three factors.第一个因素是遗传排列The first factor is the genetic set range,不是遗传点 而是排列not genetic set point,it's a range.我们都生来具备一些We're all born with特定的快乐和健康倾向性体质certain predisposition toward happiness and well-being.有些人生来就是Some people are born more with..一张笑脸 嘴里含着"笑汤匙"you know the smiley face with the smiley spoon in their mouth;另一些人则不然others less so.我们都排列在这条钟形曲线上And we're all somewhere on this,有些人注定比其他人更幸运you know bell curve,some people luckier than others.我之前也提过几次 我就没那么走运As I mentioned couple of times before,I wasn't born that lucky.我一出生就在曲线上偏焦虑的那一端I was born more on the anxious side of this curve not with the,嘴里也没含着快乐的小汤匙with the happy spoon in my mouth,但我的天性令我有资格教这门课which by the way I think helps me teach this class,因为我通过努力和各种尝试because I do these things,I apply these things,改变了自己的人生I make a difference in my life.我可以谈个人的经验You know,been there,done that,doing it.因为我有过那样的经历I can speak from personal experiences as you know.现在有些人可能会说Now some people may look at it and say,"我们还有遗传排列 真是太可怕了"‘that's terrible that we have a genetic set range.'对此 我想说 这不是什么好事Well,my answer to that is,it's not terri..也不是坏事 这只是既定事实it's not good.It's not bad.It is.就好象万有引力 无所谓好坏The law of gravity.It's not good it's not bad.It is.想要支配天性 必先服从天性And nature to be commanded must be obeyed.我们要认识自己的天性We need to look at our nature,理解 并充分善用这些天性understand it and then make the best of it.我们健康中和快乐相关的指数差异About 50 percent of our levels of well-being of the variance有50%并不是由遗传所决定的in explaining happiness can't be accounted for by genes,当然遗传基因是有影响的which explains some of the results,比如 双胞胎研究的案例or for example,the twin studies.为什么有很多对双胞胎Why there were such similarities among the twins在长期分离的情况下even if they were,or between the twins,彼此之间仍有那么多相似之处even if they were real depart.因为遗传决定的 这作用无所谓好坏Because genes matter.Not good,not bad.It is.也不是百分百由它决定 感谢上帝They matter 50 percent,not 100 percent,thank God,只有差异中的50%but 50 percent of the variance.我们应该随时牢记 对于如何运用The important thing to keep in mind is that这些基因 我们是有很多的支配能力的we have a lot of control what we do with these genes.你可以说成功是...我只是随便举例You know one could argue that success...我并不知道确切的数据and I'm just throwing out numbers.I don't know what it is exactly.成功的篮球运动员But successful basketball players50%是由遗传基因决定的 比如is determined 50 percent by genes in terms of how much fast肌肉里有多少快肌纤维和慢肌纤维twitch versus slow twitch they have in their muscles,或者 能跳多高 协调性如何or how high they can jump,how coordinated they are,身高多少 这些都很重要how tall they are.All these things matter.这些都是由基因决定的They go into the… And these are determined by genes.349但是 如果迈克尔乔丹从没练过篮球However,if Michael Jordan hadn't worked on his basketball,我应该能比他打的好I would be a better player than he is.如果他从没练过的话 而且我的确练过If he didn't work on his basketball at all,and I did and do.换句话说 在遗传作用的前提下In other words also with genes,不去努力争取幸福的人people who don't work on their happiness即便他们有最好的遗传基因 也不会比even if they have the best of genes will not do基因不如他们但努力争取的人快乐as well as people with less happy genes who work on it.所以说 后天努力至关重要So work matters a great deal.第二个对快乐差异指数The second thing that matters that有影响的因素makes up the hundred percent of variance of happiness,是外部环境external circumstances.当然了 外部环境很重要Of course,extreme circumstances make a lot of difference,我们生活在一个自由的国度whether we're living in a free country versus oppression.还是受人压迫 带来的结果是完全不同的That makes a lot of difference.但总的来说 外部环境只要不过于极端However,in general,external circumstances beyond the extremes,比如无家可归流浪街头 其实影响不大beyond being homeless on the street,make very little difference,在差异方面只有10%的作用 因此in fact,about 10% of the total variance.So genetic genes 50%,遗传作用50% 外部环境包括居住地external circumstances such as place of residence,包括收入 天气等等such as income,such as weather.另外这个不包括And again not for people,for example,有季节性情感异常的患者who have seasonal affective disorder.对于他们来说 有没有阳光太重要了Then of course it matters whether we get sun or not.我现在说的是大部分人 不包括有I'm talking about,um,most people,not people with SAD.季节性情感异常的人 因此除去极端案例So out of these extremes,external circumstances make,外部环境的作用不大 大概是10%matter about 10%,not much.第三点The third thing,剩下的40%是由意向活动决定the rest of the 40% is accounted for by intentional activities.意向活动包括我们的所作所为所想What that means is what we do,how we act,what we think about,我们对世界的诠释 和我们关注的焦点how we interpret the world,what we focus on.简而言之 就是这门课的内容In essence,what 1504 is about.包括我们从第一节课开始讨论的内容What we have discussed since the first class,以及下半学期我们将要讨论的内容what we're gonna discuss even more in the second half of the semester.这些意向活动 我们关注的焦点These intentional activities,其实就是我们的ABCour focus,these are essentially our ABCs.这也是产生有意义的变化的根源This is what real meaningful change comes.是我们将要关注的重点And this is where we are gonna focus.如果我们能改变遗传基因 当然很好Would be nice if we could do something with our genes.是很好 但是不可能Would be nice.Cannot.Would be nice如果我们能更好的控制外部环境if we had more control of our external circumstances.当然很好 但是即便是我们能控制But even if we did and many people do.结果也不会被改变 虽然在场的Many people sitting in this room or watching at home,或是在家看视频的人中 有很多的确do have more control doesn't make that much of the difference.能更好的控制外部环境What makes the most difference能改变结果的 能被我们所掌控的that we have control over are the internal activities,是内部活动 是我们对世界的诠释our interpretation of the world and our action.和我们的行动 好 现在我们就开始讲So let's jump into it.这部分的内容 A 情感 情绪 是一种连接The A,affect,emotion,the heart, it's a connection between,更多的是从逻辑上 语言上and it's a more logical connection,将情感 动力 动作连接起来linguistic connection between emotion,motivation,motion.情感 感动 移动 没有情感E-motion to move away.Without emotion we wouldn't move.我们将寸步难行 你们在书中读到了You read about it in the book.或者之后会读到 关于Elliott的故事Or you will read about it in the book about Elliott,Damásio做了关于他研究the person who Damásio researchElliott失去了情感功能who just lost his emotional faculty并随之丧失了行动做事的所有动力and with it lost all motivation to act or do anything尽管他还有认知能力even though his cognition was in place.我们要行动就必须要情感We need emotion in order to move.现在我要从两个方面谈情感So I wanna talk about,again,two aspects within emotion.首先 是渐进式变化 之后 是突发式变化The first,gradual change.The Second,more acute change.渐进式变化是一种专注冥想The gradual change is mindful meditation.专注冥想可以带来安宁沉静Mindful meditation is arguably the most powerful intervention被认为是最有效的疗法for bringing about calm and equanimity.有很多与其相关的研究A lot of research on it.我们之后会用一周的时间讲专注冥想We're gonna spend a whole week talking about it.今天我只想做一个简单的介绍Today what I wanna do is just to introduce it,the basic,讲一下专注力的螺旋曲线the foundation of the spiral of mindfulness.从许多方面来说Jon Kabatt-ZinJon Kabatt-Zin who in many ways,在这个学科领域做了很多重要的研究is responsible for bringing serious research into this realm.他和另外一些科学家 包括He along with people like Tara Bennett-Goleman,Tara Bennett-Goleman和哈佛医学院的people like Herbert Benson from the medical school here,Herbert Benson 一起在这个被认为brought serious research to this很神秘的学科领域里做了很多重要研究what was considered a mystical field."对专注力的培养可以引领我们发现“Cultivating mindfulness can lead to the discovery身心纾缓 自身宁静和洞察力of deep realms of relaxation,的最高深的境界calmness and insight within yourself.通向这个境界的路径就在The path to it in any moment lies no farther than your own body你的体内 脑中 和你自己的呼吸里"and mind and your own breathing."这就是专注力的奇妙之处This is the amazing thing about mindfulness.当我们讲到这些研究的时候 你们会看到The result that you'll see that I'll talk about那些研究结果是多么令人难以置信when we talk about research,quite literally mind-boggling.它们仅仅通过专注于呼吸I mean they change the way our mind works,和身体的某个部位 通过亲临现场transform our brain just by focusing on the breath,改变了我们的思维方式 改造了我们的大脑by focusing on parts of our body,by being present."所有人都有专注的能力"All of us have the capacity to be mindful.关键在于开发我们在此时此刻All it involves is cultivating our ability to pay attention全神贯注的能力"in the present moment."让我们花一两分钟体验一下这种感觉Let's experience it just for a minute or two.下面我想请大家做一个练习So here is what I'd like you to do once again还是那句话 如果你愿意做就做if you feel comfortable with it.请大家在椅子上坐好 将后背So sit back,on your,on your chair with your back against,靠在椅背上against the,the back rest.尽量坐舒服了Make yourself as comfortable as you can.两脚放松 平放在地上Plant both feet on the ground comfortably.如果你愿意 如果你愿意的话And if you feel comfortable,if you feel comfortable,闭上双眼just close your eyes.现在把注意力放在你的呼吸上And move your attention to your breathing.深吸一口气 吸至丹田Take a deep breath in,into your belly.慢慢的 静静的 轻轻的呼气Slow,quiet,gentle exhalation.再次慢慢的深吸一口气 直至丹田Deep slow inhalation,all the way into your belly.慢慢的轻轻的静静的长长的呼出来Slow,gentle,quiet,long exhalation.如果你的思绪飘走了 把它放回到呼吸上来If you mind wanders,just return to your breathing.现在想象你在脑中观察自己的身体Now in your mind's eye,just scan your body,your forehand,你的前额 眼睛 鼻子 嘴 脖子 胸膛your eyes,your nose,mouth,your neck,your chest,你的后背 腰 双腿 一直向下your upper back,lower back,your legs,直到你的双脚 上下观察你的身体all the way down to your feet.Just scan your body同时继续深深的慢慢的轻轻的呼吸while continuing to breathe deeply,slowly and gently.在你打量自己的时候 寻找身上的And through your scan,find a part of your body一个部位 比其它部位更紧绷that is a little bit more tense than the others.可能是你的下巴 脖子It could be your jaws.It could be your neck.可能是你的肩膀 你的胃部It could be your shoulders,your stomach.你感到这个部位有些不适You're feeling a little bit of disease.可能是你的腿 膝盖 双脚Could be your legs,your knees,your feet.找到这个部位Identify that one part of the body它比其它部位更紧绷that is a little bit more tense than the others把注意力放在这个部位上 继续呼吸and focus on it and continue to breath.深吸一口气 将气引至那个部位Take a deep breath into that part of your body.然后在你放松呼气的时候And when you let go and you exhale,把那种紧绷感也呼出去 放松also let go of the tension that's there.Just relax it.多深吸几口气至该部位And take a few deep breath into that part of your body然后放松 呼气and relax it and let go.重新将注意力放在呼吸上 深吸一口气Return your focus to your breathing.Take a deep breath in.慢慢的轻轻的静静的长长的呼气Slow gentle quiet long exhale,relaxing with the exhalation.同时放松 深吸一口气 慢慢的轻轻的长吐出来Deep breathing in,deep slow gentle long exhaling.在下次呼气之后At the end of the next

Goleman.Tara Bennett Goleman.如果有人还在说梦话 请把他们叫醒If someone is speaking in their sleep,please wake them up.Tara Bennett Goleman 在她的Tara Bennett Goleman,in her book,‘Emotional Alchemy'.'情感炼金术'一书中写到"专注力“Mindfulness means seeing things as they are,意味着看到事物的本来面目 而不是without trying to change them.试图去改变它们 关键是要消解我们The point is to dissolve our reactions to disturbing emotions,对负面情绪的反应 而不是抵制情绪being careful not to reject the emotion itself."这就是所谓做人的权利This is what permission to be human is all about.随着情绪 感受情绪Along the emotion,experiencing the emotion,在这个过程中呼吸吐纳and just breathing through it.虽然不一定总会这样 但是很多时候And very often when we do that,not always,如此一来 情绪就消解了but very often,it dissolves.随着这种情绪的消解And with it,with the emotional dissolution of the emotion comes令人痛苦的情感也得到了心理解离also the psychological dissolution of this painful emotion.还是那句话 春假回来以后Again we'll talk much,much more我们会谈到很多关于这个疗法的内容about this very important intervention after spring break.这就是渐进式的变化This is about gradual change.在我们待会说到研究报告的时候What we'll see when we talk about research大家会发现 即便这种渐进式变化is that even if this is gradual change,只是短短的8周的日常冥想within as little as 8 weeks of regular meditation,我们的大脑也会开始改变形状our brain actually starts to change its form to transform.我们的免疫系统得到增强Our immune system strengthens即便只有短短8周的日常冥想after as little as 8 weeks of regular daily meditation.而且不一定是一天5小时的冥想It doesn't have to be 5 hours a day.有时候就是一天30或20分钟As little as 30 minutes or 20 minutes a day已经足以带来变化can already affect change.这个过程是循序渐渐的 缓慢的This is gradual, slow,希望大家可以用一生去实践hopefully something that you'll take up as a life time,这是一个终身疗法life long intervention.下面的例子是从突发变化的角度Here is an example of more acute change00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,120分析我们的情感 所以when it comes to our emotion.当我想填满这个3乘2模型的方盒子So when I thought about filling in this box in the 3 by 2 model,我应该怎么去找情感突发式变化的how do I find the acute emotional change?案例呢?我立刻想到了一个临床心理学Immediately my mind went to research in clinical psychology,研究 是关于创伤后应激障碍的specifically to post-traumatic stress disorder.有成千上万的文章Post-traumatic stress disorder,something都是关于创伤后应激障碍that has been studied thousands and thousands of articles;我们系也做了相关的研究research done in our department too.当我想到它的时候 我对自己说And when I look at it,I said,'好吧 这是一个突发式变化的案例'well,this is an example of an acute change,a very acute change非常突然的变化' 因为实际上Because what happens when we have a trauma,当我们有创伤之后 很多人的一生many people after the trauma are changed forever,因为创伤后应激障碍而从此改变了for the rest of their lives if they have PTSD.它实际上改变了It actually has changed,我们大脑中的化学物质changes the chemical that flow through our brain.它改变了我们大脑的结构It changes the structure of our brain,建立了新的神经通路 破坏了很多creates new neural pathways,kills a lot of old neural pathways以前的神经通路 全都是因为as a result of a single experience.一个单独的经历 就像是大锤一挥It's a sledge hammer.很不幸的是这是一个非常常见的疾病It is very widespread unfortunately.我上次已经说过了I mentioned it last time.00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:30,68030%的越南战争老兵有创伤后应激障碍30 percent of Vietnam vets have PTSD.30 percent.30%之多 80%的第一次海湾战争老兵80 percent from the first Gulf War have PTSD.有创伤后应激障碍 我之前也提过As I mention我们现在还没有关于第二次海湾战争we don't have the exact data yet from the second Gulf War.的确切数据 但是相信人数只会更多不会更少But the numbers are likely gonna be higher than that.在911之前 在纽约110号大街以南After 911 or before 911 right,there were 20,000 individuals有两万人有创伤后应激障碍with PTSD south of 110th street New York.911刚刚过去之后Right after 911,有6万人有创伤后应激障碍60,000 individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder.这对人是有影响的Now this has consequences.影响了我们的大脑功能Again it has consequences on the way our brain functions,这种影响很多时候是终其一生的very often,not always,but very often for the rest of our lives.这就是突发式的变化So this is an acute change.伴随着创伤而来It comes immediately one trauma,比如911 或者在战争中的恐怖经历911 or seeing something terrible in war.从而影响了余生And then that often has an effect for the rest of,影响了整个人生for the per..,for the entire life.这是一种休克疗法 消极的休克疗法It's a shock treatment,a negative shock treatment.当我想到创伤后应激障碍的时候Now when look at PTSD when I thought about it,I asked,我问'OK 这和积极心理学有啥关系'‘OK,so what is positive psychology have to do with this.'这属于临床心理学的范畴 就是所谓的I mean this is clinical psychology.消极心理学 但是其实有很大关系This is ”negative psychology”.Well the answer is a lot.首先 从1998年起开始有很多相关研究First of all,a lot of research started only 1998,仅仅是在10年以前 就是在again,10 years ago,人们开始关注幸福心理学的时候the time when positive psychology came in to the scene,开始有很多关于创伤后成长的研究research on post-traumatic growth.研究发现 实际上更多的人在经历创伤后And what was found was that in fact more people experience growth得到的是成长 而不是应激障碍as a result of a trauma than post,than PTSD.然而 没人提起创伤后成长However,we don't talk about post-traumatic growth.每个人都知道创伤后应激障碍Everyone knows about PTSD.但是再次说明了 这又是一个关于But again this is another example of where the light is not shed人们不愿去关注正面事物的案例on something that is actually working well.如何正面呢 就是大部分人And what is working here?其实是非常有能力去承受创伤的Most people are extremely resilient able to withstand trauma.这是一个非常振奋人心的事实And that is a very empowering understanding to have.如果人们知道这是可能实现的We'll become more of a self-fulfilling prophecy,是常见的 如果人们不会对经历and more people will experience post-traumatic growth创伤后成长感到愧疚 那么if they only knew that it was a possibility that it was common.我们就会有更多自我实现的预言If they didn't feel guilty about experiencing growth也会有更多人拥有创伤后成长的经历as a result of trauma.在我经历了越南战争之后 有了How can I grow after what I saw,what I visioned,那样的所见所闻 我怎么会成长呢?what I experienced in Vietnam.It's wrong.这是不对的 再说一次 世事总有不幸Again things don't happen for the best.但是有些人能尽量从世事中受益But some people are able to make the best of things that happen.当人们开始关注事情带来的益处时Post-traumatic growth,就会产生创伤后成长it happens when people begin to focus on the benefit.那么 创伤能带来什么好处呢So what is the benefit of this trauma.发生这种事终归是不幸的It didn't happen for the best.比如 我从患癌症这件事上学到什么呢But what if I learn from my cancer for example.和家人的关系更亲密 更珍惜生命Well,to be closer to my family,to appreciate the breath,更珍惜花草自然 更享受to appreciate the flowers,to enjoy my friends more.和朋友在一起的时光 这件事Didn't happen for the best.的确不幸 但是我却尽量从中受益But I'm gonna make…I did make the best of it.这就是价值发现Benefit finding.再或者 很多人能在写日记的时候Or many people are able to find meaning in it through journaling.得到启示 我们下节课会讲到记日记We'll talk about journaling next class.再或者 有些人能够分享创伤经历Or people who are able to share their experience of the trauma.还记得二战大屠杀的幸存者Remember the difference和越战老兵之间的区别吗?between holocaust survivors and Vietnam vets.对于不幸的经历 大屠杀幸存者拿来Holocaust survivors shared,talked about it,wrote about it.分享讨论 把它写出来 越战老兵则Vietnam vets ruminated about it.只是反复去想 回到我们之前说的Going back to the Lyubomirsky study.Lyubomirsky的研究 当你只想不说And when you just ruminate without sharing,不把心里话倒出来without,without taking it out.它会积压在心里 更容易形成It becomes stronger and it's more likely to become PTSD.创伤后应激障碍 并不一定要这样But it doesn't always do that.了解创伤后成长的好处And it's important to understand是至关重要的the magnetism of post-traumatic growth.那么现在我向大家提一个问题So here is the question that I have.既然这是讲幸福心理学的课程This is a positive psychology course.大家应该还记得幸福心理学Remember what positive psychology is;关注的是有用的有效的事物is that it focuses on what works.因此在备课的时候So the question that I asked myself我问了自己一个问题as I was preparing for this course was this.有没有一个正面的和创伤相对应的元素Is there a positive equivalent to trauma,它的效果强大 但同时是正面积极的something that is so powerful yet positive并最终能像猛击大锤一样that will change the way our brain functions瞬间改变我们大脑的运作模式?in an instance like a sledgehammer?有这样的元素吗?换句话说 我想问Is there something like that? Or in other words,what I asked is,会不会有一种正面的经历可以创造can a single positive experience create a positive channel一条正向的通道 引领我们得到更多that will lead to a permanent increase in wellbeing,健康 宁静 和积极的回忆 也就是说calm and positive memories.和创伤后应激障碍正相反的反应In other words,the opposite of PTSD.再重复一次:勤问必有所得 求索始于追问And again asking you shall receive.A question begins a quest.当我问出这个问题 在我眼前立马开启了And as soon as I ask this question,it open up channels that一条我前所未见的通道I didn't see before that were literally right in front of my eyes这就是我多年来一直钻研其中的And this was the work that我心目中的最伟大的知识分子I've studied for many years of one of my intellectual heroes,马斯洛提出的高峰体验理论Abraham Maslow who talks about the peak experience.我现在要说的这个理论 更多的Now,what I'm gonna talk about now是一种假设性理论 而未经过实证的is more hypothesis than well grounded research.我希望你们当中有人能It's a hypothesis that I hope some of you will,将这个假设性理论当成论文课题研究will research either here as your senior thesis,或者以后 能鼓励别人研究这个理论or in the future,or will encourage people to research these ideas.我在这个课上讲的理论Everything that I share in this class都是经过大量研究证实的is based on very rigorous research.只有这个领域是假设性的This is one area where it's a hypothesis.但还是请大家听一下 我讲完后But bear with me and see what you think of it,请好好想想这个假设性理论of this hypothesis when I finish explaining it.因为虽然是有一些相关研究Because there is some,some research on it,not enough,但是不多 不足以证实其真实性you know for a stand of approval yet.但还是请大家想想看它有没有道理But think about it.Does it make sense.那么 让我们先了解一下什么So let's see what is a peak experience.是高峰体验 马斯洛的定义是Maslow's definition of a peak experience:'高峰体验是人类生命中最精彩‘it's a generalization for the best moments of the human being,最幸福的时刻 最令人心醉神迷for the happiest moments of life,欣喜若狂 极乐体验的高度浓缩for experiences of ecstasy,rapture,bliss,of the greatest joy.我发现 这种体验一般来自于I found that such experiences came from profound aesthetic深度美学体验 包括创作时的喜悦experiences such as creative ecstasies,moments of mature love,爱情 完美的性体验 为人父母perfect sexual experiences,parental love,自然分娩 以及其他的人生体验'experiences of natural childbirth,and many others.'每个人 或是绝大多数人都有这种体验Everyone or most of people have the experience,这种高峰体验peak experiences again不管是你的男女朋友在一起的时候whether it was with your girlfriend boyfriend,还是在读一本好书的时候whether it was reading a book,还是在听你最爱的音乐的时候whether it was listening to your favourate piece of music.这种体验就好象 嗯Just being one with the experience,it was..um..许多神学家会说宗教体验Many of theologians talk about as the religious experience,信仰体验 比如当你走在花园里as spiritual experience where you just walked through the yard突然你看到了约翰哈佛(铜像) 也许and suddenly felt one -it was a John Harvard.不是他 总之是一种集之大成的体验Maybe not.But experience just one with everything.这种体验就是人们所说的禅This is the experience they talk about in Zen,与现在连接起来being connected to the present,感觉是如此美好如此完整feeling so good so complete like you don't need anything else.好像你已经完满了 拥有了一切Everything is right here.我和家人在一起的时候就有这样的体验Now I know I experience with my family at times.昨天晚上我和亲朋好友一起吃晚餐You know last night having dinner with my family and friends.你们知道吗 当我们围坐在一起You know we were sitting around,I just felt this is it.我感觉 这就是了 夫复何求You know what else do I need.感觉如此完整 享受当下 这就是Just being so complete,so in the moment.A peak experience.高峰体验 但是这种体验一般不会长久Now these peak experiences usually don't last for very long.是会消逝的 它只存在于高峰一刻They come and they go.It's a peak.但是 它是有震荡效应的However,they can and often do have repercussions.660现在 也许你们已经知道我Now,maybe you can see now where I'm going with this.接下来要说什么了 当我想到So do I,what I thought about高峰体验的时候 我发现它也许when I thought about peak experiences was maybe,只是也许 和创伤带来的影响是同等的just maybe this is the positive equivalent to the trauma.也许它是一种喜悦式的休克疗法Maybe it's a shock treatment of ecstasy能够带来超越体验本身的效果that can have effect beyond just the experience itself,就好像创伤后应激障碍一样just like PTSD has effect beyond the experience itself.时至今日 仍有人活在911的回忆中There're people today who are living and reliving 911,这些回忆仍然影响着他们的大脑still affecting them,still affecting their brain,创造着新的通道 新的神经通路creating new channels,01年9月11日之前并不存在的通路new pathways that didn't exist before 9/11/01.所以说 高峰体验是一种喜悦式的So is peak experience shock treatment of ecstasy?休克疗法吗?如果它反面对应的是创伤If peak experience is the positive equivalent of a trauma,那么和创伤后应激障碍对应的就是then the equivalent of a post-traumatic stress disorder我管它叫高峰体验后通路is what I called post peak experience order.我知道 是土了一点 但是我觉得I know,cheesy.But I think there is something behind it.是有道理的 相关的研究其实很少Some research on it.Some,very,um,very little.但是我认为这理论是有效的But I think it actually works.其中一个研究So one of the research studies是由马斯洛的一个学生做的that was done it was by one of Maslow's student.她研究是 生过小孩的妇女She studied,um women after child birth.她发现在一些时候And what she found was that sometimes,这种情况并不是大多数 妇女有时候not always,in fact not most times,在生小孩的时候会有高峰体验but often these women experience peak experience.这种体验改变了她们的人生And it changed their lives.体验带来的后果是 她们变得As a result of it,they became more confident,更自信 更宽容 更友善 更快乐more generous and benevolent,and happier,一切都源于一个单独的人生体验just as a result of a single experience,一种喜悦休克疗法 这种体验a shock treatment of ecstasy,something which was,发生在她们身上 对她们意义非凡which happened to them,which meant so much to them.这个实验是在50年代初期做的Now they did this research in the early 50s or late,还是晚期 不 是50年代初no,early 50s.现在 这种情况对于男士也更常见了Today it may also happen more often with men because因为现在的男士比起以前更可能men today are more likely to be present when the child is born.出现在孩子出生的现场 当我儿子I know that in my…when David was born,David出生的时候 我当场喜极而泣you know I burst out crying.对于我来说 那是一种非常强烈的It was a very powerful experience when it happened;体验 绝对是一种高峰体验certainly peak experience for me.下面是马斯洛对于高峰体验的阐释Here's what Maslow says about peak experiences.And他没明白说就是高峰体验后通路again not talking specifically about post peak experience order,但是也算是一种暗示but alluding to it.'高峰体验通常会带来一些后果‘Peak experiences often have consequences...效果等同于心理疗法They can do the same there as psychotherapy,前提是体验者目标明确if one keeps his goals right,有自知之明and if one knows just what he is about,并且清楚自己的方向and if one is conscious of what he is going toward.一方面 我们当然可以只讨论We can certainly talk,on the one hand,怎么分解症状 怎么老调重弹of the breaking up of symptoms,like the breaking up of cliches,分解焦虑 或其它问题 另一方面 我们of anxieties,or the like; or on the other hand,还可以去探讨怎么培养自主性和勇气we can talk about the development of spontaneity,and of courage,怎么培养奥运选手 幽默感 诸如此类and of Olympian or Godlike humor and suchness,感知认识 身体感知 和其它.'sensory awareness,body awareness,and the like.'所以他的意思是说 如果我们做一些So what he's saying here is that these effects事后跟进的工作 那么会产生一些具有can have consequences beyond just the peak experience影响力的效果 而不仅仅是高峰体验if we do certain thing such as follow up on it.W. James在'宗教经验多样化'一书中William James in The Varieties of Religious Experiences talks about谈到改变人生的时刻 以及它们such moments that change lives and how they change lives.怎样改变人生 高峰体验可以创造Peak experience can quite literally lead to a new brain order.新的大脑结构 虽然相关问题And again the jury still out on the research.仍待研究 但已有越来越多的迹象But there's more and more suggestions.显示这是有迹可寻的And we'll talk about it next time as well如果我们知道该怎么做 高峰体验that show that there is something there,可以产生和创伤相对应的正面效应that it can be the positive equivalent of a trauma下次我们会详细讲这部分的内容if we know what we do,to do with it.现在我们要说一个很关键的问题And here's the important issue.首先 我们会有高峰体验吗The question is first我们能有更多的高峰体验吗?do we experience peak experiences and experience more of them?其次 在我们经历了高峰体验之后And second,after we experience peak experience,我们怎样做才能获得高峰体验后通路?how can we make it more likely that we enjoy PPEO?因为正如同 并不是所有人都会经历Because just like not everyone after a trauma experience PTSD.创伤后应激障碍 事实上大部分人没有In fact,the majority don't.Just in the same way,同样 大部分人在高峰体验过后most people don't experience PPEO after a peak experience.并未获得高峰体验后通路How do you increase the likelihood,怎样增加首先是高峰体验发生的概率first of increasing peak experience and second of increasing其次是高峰体验后通路的概率the likelihood of post peak experience order.因此 怎么增强高峰体验So to enhance peak experience,这堂课基本上讲的就是关于这个内容just very briefly because essentially the course is about that.现在我要讲几个概念 当中有So I'm gonna just throw out a few ideas that我们以前讲过的 也有之后要讲的we've talked about and some that we'll talk about.首先 全然为人 接纳 接纳你的情绪First,permission to be human.Acceptance,accepting emotions.为什么呢 因为如果我们不能接受Why? Because if we don't accept painful emotions,痛苦的情绪 如果我们不能让自己if we don't give ourselves permission to be human,全然为人的 我们就阻断了自己的we're blocking our emotional pathways.情绪通路 而所有积极和痛苦的And positive emotions and painful emotions情绪都流动于同一条情绪通路often flow through the same emotional pathways.当我们限制其一的时候 我们也限制了And when we're limiting one,we're very often limiting the other.另一方 因此如果我们开启通路So if we open up the pathways,接受自己全然为人give ourselves the permission to be human无论是出于悲伤或极度的喜悦and give ourselves the permission to cry允许自己哭泣when we're sad or ecstatic.我们就能开启通路That very often opens up,让自己更容易感受到积极的情绪makes it more likely that we experience positive emotions as well看似矛盾Paradoxical,但这就是全然为人的隽语but this is the paradox of the permission to be human.当我们允许自己感受痛苦的情绪When we give ourselves permission to experience painful emotions,我们就会更容易感受到积极的情绪we're more likely to experience the positive emotions.还有就是 专注力 感受当下Mindfulness,being present.举个例子 很多时候 当我们听音乐Lot of time when we are listening to music,就是全神贯注的听音乐的时候for example,really listening to music,不是放着背景音乐 在一边发短信not just having it as background while text messaging,做功课 和朋友聊天doing homework,and talking to our friends.而是全神贯注的听我们喜欢的音乐But when we really listen to music that we love,很多时候 我们会有临场的高峰体验very often we have a peak experience being present.根据马斯洛的理论According to Maslow's research,这两个条件能令我们最可能these are two of the most likely,获得高峰体验most likely areas where we can experience the peak experience.顺便说一下 我相信这也是一种天赋And by the way this I believe is,is innate.我从我一岁的女儿Sherio身上看到了You know even I see with,with Sherio,my one year old daughter.这种天赋 每当音乐响起 我们随之起舞You know when there is music,when we dance,she laughs.她就会开心的笑 这不是我们教她的This is not something we taught her.人对音乐和舞蹈的爱好是天生的We were born with,with this inclination for music and dance.我们需要花时间去发掘这种天赋We need to take time for that.Having a meaningful goal.制定一个有意义的目标When we're on purpose,当我们有所追求 做自己爱做的事情when we're doing things that we love to do,when what we are,做自己觉得有意义 重要的事情we are doing is meaningful and significant to us,我们更容易获得高峰体验we're much more likely to experience peak experiences.最后 我们当今文化中最严重的问题Finally one of the greatest barriers in our culture,time.时间 当我们匆匆忙忙赶时间 倍感It's very difficult to experience peak experiences倍感压力和焦虑的时候 我们很难when we're on the rush,when we're stressed and anxious.获得高峰体验 这些都是高峰体验杀手These are peak experience killers.无论是在做爱的时候Whether it's when making love,还是听音乐的时候whether it's when listening to music,或者和朋友一起的时候whether it's with when spending time with friends,当所有这些发生情况的时候 都一样or all of the above together.那么一旦有了高峰体验 我们应该如何How do we enhance the likelihood of PPEO once增加获得高峰体验后通路的可能性呢we have experienced peak experience?首先 我们可以重演画面First thing,replaying an image.还记得吗 我们说过大脑Remember the mind并不能分辨真实和想象doesn't know the difference within the imaginary and the real.它可以将发生过的画面多次重播It plays it over and over again.当我们多次重播该画面的时候And when we play it over and over again,神经通路得到了巩固the neural pathway is reinforced.这条通路由大锤凿开The sledge hammer begins the neural pathway.之后我们通过画面重演来巩固它And then we reinforce it through replaying through imagination.我们还可以把经历写出来Writing about it.下周我们的心得报告作业This is gonna be a response paper next week.就是要大家写自己的高峰体验Writing about a peak experience.当我们记录这种体验的时候 只是描述When we journal about it,describing it,not analyzing it.而不是分析 记住Lyubomirsky说的两者差别Remember the difference with Lyubomirsky.Positive emotions,正面的情绪和经历不适于被分析positive experiences is not as helpful to analyze.所以 只要去描述这种经历So just to describe it,once again reinforce the neural pathways.再次巩固神经通路We relive it.We replay it.花时间去重演 花时间去重播它Once again taking time,taking time.最后 就是要采取行动And finally taking action通过采取行动 我们能巩固最初的体验which is how we can reinforce the initial experience of the,即高峰体验 巩固神经通路um,the peak experience,reinforce the neural pathways.所以说 当我有了高峰体验之后So I had it inside,我心里会感到柳暗花明 豁然开朗an Ah-ha moment as a result of this peak experience.现在我得付诸行动Now I'm gonna do something about it and act,这也是我今天要讲的第二部分-行为which leads me to the second point,which is B-behavior.20年来 自从我还未满20岁的时候开始I've been teaching and participating in workshops我就一直在教和参与各类关于and seminars and classes on self improvement psychology,自我提升心理学 幸福心理学positive psychology and clinical psychology for almost 20 yeas临床心理学的课程 讲习班和研讨会since I was,since I was,well before I was 20.我发现 不管是在别人的讲习班上And what I noticed in other people's workshops,还是自己的讲习班上or in my workshops in seminars in classes is the following.如果课程效果好的话 大部分人Most people,if the workshop or the class is good,在周末或期末离开的时候exit the classroom,or the weekend or the semester.如果之前他们在这里If they were here before,之后他们都会经历一个高峰they usually experience a relative high after.但是一般人会分为两组But there're two groups of people.两组人都会经历高峰Both groups experience a relative high.第一组人 很不幸这组人占大多数The first group which unfortunately are the majority.在经历了高峰之后 最后回到了原来的After that high,go back to their base level of happiness,幸福基点 我们对此并不陌生something we're familiar with.第二组人 不是多数The second group,not majority,是一小部分人 在经历了高峰之后but not a small minority experience that high after.这种高峰并不持久That high doesn't last forever.但是当他们落下来的时候However,they go back,but when they go back,他们的幸福基点比之前高出来their base level of wellbeing is higher than it was before.之后尽管也有起起伏伏And they continue to have their vicissitudes,但是都是在这个新基点上下起伏but this time along a higher base level of happiness than before.不用说 我当然很想Now needless to say,知道为什么有些人是这样I want to understand why people experience this,另一些人是那样some people and other people experience this,因为我想让参加我课程的人能拥有because I want people who take my class持久性的变化 而不是昙花一现的改变to enjoy lasting change as opposed to temporary.只是短暂的感觉良好是不够的Nice,feels good,not enough.这既对不住他们为课程所付出的努力It doesn't justify the effort that they put into the workshop.也对不住我为课程付出的努力And it doesn't justify the effort that I put into my work.所以我很想弄明白两者之间的差异So I want to understand the difference between the two.下面就是我发现的这两组人And here is the single most important difference之间存在的最重要的差异that I identified between these two groups.第二组人所具备的显著特点Group 2,the distinguishing characteristic就是在讲习班或课程或研讨会结束之后was that after the workshop or class or seminar,会立刻做出行为上的改变not at the end of the semester if it was a semester long class,如果是一个学期的课程 他们不是在学期after each class or after many of the classes结束后才做 而是每节课或几节课之后就做introducing immediate behavioral change.他们不会边等边说'好吧 等课程全结束了They don't wait and say ‘ok,after this course is over,我到时再重新评估人生 看自己能做什么'I'll reevaluate my life and see how I do.而是立刻采取实质上的行为改变Immediately introducing real behavioral change,比如 做一些上课讲过的练习doing exercises that we talked about in class,学着承担以前不敢承担的风险taking risks that they haven't before总之 立刻改变 而不是等着but introducing change immediately,not waiting.而这些立刻改变的人并不会因此And those introduce change immediately而拥有永久的高峰体验don't have a high or peak experience constantly.但是他们的幸福基点会提高But their base level of happiness goes up而不像其他人 因为没有改变as opposed to going down returning to而回落到和以前一样的水平where it was before when there was no behavioral change.所以 现在每当我有长达数天的And now I start every workshop and seminar讲习班和研讨会 我都会在一开始就when I have a few day workshop给大家介绍这种变化的模式or seminar introducing this model of change.我们从很多心理学研究中学到What do we know from a lot of research in psychology态度和行为是密切相关的is there is a relationship between attitudes and behaviors.这一点我们以前讲过 提到过And we talked about it,we illuded into it already in the past.所以说我们都有自己的态度 无论是关于So we all have attitudes whether it's attitudes about psychology,心理学的态度 还是关于其他人whether it's attitudes about another person,或是关于自己的态度whether it's attitude about myself.这些态度影响着我们的行为And these attitudes affect our behavior.比如说 如果我对心理学 或是幸福心理学So for example,if I have a positive attitude towards psychology抱有好感 相对于对心理学or positive psychology,I'm more likely to take 1504 than完全没好感的状况if my attitude towards psychology我更有可能去选1504这门课and positive psychology is negative.或者说 如果我对一种想法Or if I have a good attitude toward a certain belief或对一个人有好感about a certain person,比起对其毫无好感的情况I'm much more likely to want befriend this person我更有可能和他成为朋友if I like him than if I don't.所以说 态度影响行为So attitudes affect behavior.这是显而易见的 很容易理解That's very clear,easy to understand.但是一些心理学家 包括Alice EaglyBut what psychologists have found,Daryl Bem和其他一些人the likes of Alice Eagly,Daryl Bem and others.他们发现行为同样也能影响态度What they have found is that behavior also affects attitude.这是一条双行线It works both ways.所以说如果我有某种行为模式So if I behave in a certain way,我的行为很可能会改变我相应的态度it is likely to change my attitude in accordance with my behavior这个问题我们以前也讲过And remember we talked about it.为什么呢?因为如果说我们有某种态度Why? Because we have an attitude.我们的行为就好像外在的世界And our behavior is the outside world.我们的大脑不能接受The mind doesn't like内在和外在不一致的情况when there is incongruence between the inside and outside.00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:00,200因此如果我们的行为是这样的So if we behave in a certain way,那我们的态度就会被拉下来the attitude is gonna be pulled down to reflect that behavior.和行为相对应 如果我们的行为是这样If we behave in this way,大脑不喜欢不一致的情况the attitude the mind doesn't like incongruence,它就会让两者达到对等it's going to create equality between the two,让两者之间达到一致 谐调congruency consistency between the two.方法就是要不然改变我们的行为 或者And the way it'll do that is either by changing our behavior,这点很关键-更多时候 改变我们的态度and here is the key,or more often by changing our attitude.我们在场的所有人 不管你是Now all of us here,18岁还是80岁 我们都有自己的习惯whether you are 18 or whether you are 80,we all have habits.我们最初养成习惯 习惯之后造就了我们And again,we first make our habits and then our habits make us.习惯是一种行为模式 思维模式Habits are behavioral patterns,thinking patterns.行为 行动比语言更有力Behaviors are more powerful.Action is more powerful than words.如果我们在这堂课之前 有某种行为习惯If we have a certain behavior that we had before the class.这堂课改变了你对某件事的态度What the class does is change your attitude about a certain thing如果因此你的态度变得和行为不相符But if it doesn't match with your behavior,下课之后 你的大脑寻求一致性after the class the mind looks for consistency.你的态度会被拉回到原来的状态The attitude is gonna be pulled down back to where it was before除非你改变自己的行为unless your behavior changes to match your change of behavior.所有的课程 不管是1504还是公正课或All the class can do,whether it's 1504 or Justice or Psych 1.心理学1 所有的课程 讲习班 研讨会All the class all workshop and seminar.所做的都是改变态度All they can do is introduce attitudinal change.在这门课上In this class,态度的转变就是 比如说 自尊attitudinal change is one,for example,self-esteem.什么是自尊?是一种我对自己的态度What is self-esteem? The attitude that I have toward myself;高自尊就是正面的 低自尊是负面的high self-esteem positive,low self-esteem negative.价值发现者和错误发现者的不同What is the benefit finder versus the fault finder在于他们看待世界的态度不同is the attitude toward the world.我把这个看成是积极的 能带给我Do I see this positive as a resource for wellbeing?幸福的呢 还是像错误发现者一样觉得是消极的Or do I focus on the negative as a fault finder.完美主义 是一种对待失败的态度Perfectionism.It's an attitude toward failure.这门课能做的 我和你们的助教所能做的But all this class can do all I can do all your TFs can do就是激发或鼓励你们在态度上的转变is introduce or encourage attitudinal changes,通过介绍这些研究 让你们相信to convince you through research正向思维的作用that learn to focus on the positive.但是 如果你们不在行为上做出改变However,if you don't follow up with behavior比如去做感恩练习and that means doing the gratitude study,比如这周要交的感谢信um the gratitude exercise that means writing the letter这个练习是应该定期去做的you are responsible for this week but doing it regularly.除非之后有相应的行为Unless behavior is gonna follow,否则你的态度会回复原状the attitude will go back and reflect your attitude你的态度和行为都和上课and your behavior from before the class或是接受疗法之前没有两样or before the intervention.必须要有行为上的改变There has to be behavioral change.现在我要给你们看一些研究Let me show you some studies showing00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:39,120这些研究的结果显示了行为改变的影响力the impact of the behavioral change.这个研究实验的对象是This was done prisoners of war朝鲜战争期间的美国战俘in American prisoners of war during the Korean War.当时就在街对面的MIT 科学家E.ScheinAnd what Edgar Schein who's just across street here at MIT showed发现关押战俘的人最终改变了美国战俘was that the captors of the Americans got them对于共产主义 对于中国人的态度to change their minds about Communism,about the Chinese.这些关押他们的人只是很简单的Captors.要求他们把共产主义的优越性How gradually by simply asking them写下来write about the good things within Communism.我们知道 我们不喜欢共产主义We know we don't like Communism.如果喜欢的话 我们也不会打仗了We wouldn't be fighting if we did.但是要求他们只写优越性But write about the positives of it.写给你的狱友看Write it to your prison-mates.写信回家 告诉家人你被如何对待Write letters home,telling them how you being treated当然确保他们只能写好话 所以他们and making sure of course they only focus on the good.并没有要求战俘们撒谎 虽然战俘确实So they didn't ask them to lie necessarily though often they did.951时常写些谎话 他们要求战俘只写优越性But they asked them to focus on the positive.长此以往 态度发生了转变Over time,the attitude actually changed.他们对关押者的戒备少了And they became actually more open好感多了and more positive toward their captors.因为他们的态度变了 通过写信Because their behavior,writing letters,和朋友聊天talking to their friends about it,还要做报告 每一次都在they have to give lectures on it,说"我觉得这样很好"was one of “I feel positive about this”.长此以往 他们的态度发生了转变And their attitude over time actually changed.变得更积极正面了And they became more positive.认知距离-这个词Cognitive distance,你们中间上过心理学1的人可能听说过those of you who have taken Psych 1 or others heard about it.认知距离的产生是因为两种想法Cognitive distance is when there is incongruence之间不一致 两种信念相冲突between two thoughts when two beliefs are conflicting.或者说行为和信念相冲突We don't like it.We want there to be a match.我们不愿看到这种情况 我们想要一致Or when there is a conflict between behavior and a belief.认知距离理论是讲这种冲突And what cognitive distance says is that this is...必须要被消解has to be resolved.我们消解它的方法就是让我们的And the way we resolve it is usually by getting our attitudes,态度 我们的想法和信念 尽量符合our thoughts,our beliefs to match our behavior.我们的行为 因为行为比语言更有力Again behaviors is more powerful than words.自我认知理论 我们已经讲过很多次了Self perception theory,we talked about a lot.这次我不打算详细说了I'm not gonna elaborate on it any more.就是我们认识自己We see ourselves.并从中衍生出自我结论And we derive certain conclusions about ourselves.脸部回馈假说Facial feedback hypothesis.如果你现在皱眉或者轻柔的微笑If you put on a frown now or a nice gentle smile,你体内的化学物质会发生变化your body chemistries are actually going to change to reflect这种变化反映了你表情的变化whatever your face is showing.引用一句名言 是...一行禅师说的So this is a quote by..where is it? By Thich Nhat Hanh.他的名字不好念 他是一个佛教僧侣Kind of difficult to pronounce his name,a Buddhist monk."有时你的欢乐是微笑的源泉"Sometimes your joy is the source of your smile,但有时你的微笑也可以成为欢乐的源泉"but sometimes your smile can be the source of your joy."所以说实际上 我们面部表情的变化So we actually influence our body.能够对我们的身体和情绪产生影响We actually influence our mood through our face.这也解释了为什么演员 不管演的That's why actors very often can get into是什么角色 都经常会入戏很深whatever character they're playing simply by acting.因为脸部回馈于身体其它部位Because there's the facial feedback to the rest of your body.在你做面部表情的时候You actually release chemicals你体内释放了相应的化学物质according with the face that you are making.William James的一段话William James."吹口哨壮胆绝不仅仅是一种比喻“Whistling to keep up courage is no mere figure of speech.同样 无精打采的坐一天On the other hand,sit all day in a moping posture,sigh,哀声叹气 语气阴沉and reply to everything with a dismal voice,00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:02,都会加重你的忧郁and your melancholy lingers...舒展眉头 发亮双眼Smooth the brow,brighten the eyes,挺胸收腹 声音洪亮contract the dorsal rather than the ventral aspect of the frame,友善的夸奖别人and speak in a major key,pass the genial compliment,除非你的心如钢铁and your heart must be frigid indeed否则不会不为这样的人所动"if it does not gradually thaw."William James所说的已经不仅仅What essentially William James is talking about是脸部回馈假说is something beyond the facial feedback hypothesis.而是一个很少有相关研究的假说It's something where there is not much research身体回馈假说just a little research on which is the body feedback hypothesis.如果你整天这样坐着 而不是骄傲的If you sit down all day like this versus upright in proud,挺胸抬头 你的情绪会因此受到影响it will affect your mood.它会从几个方面影响你对自己的观感It will affect how you feel about yourself in a few ways.首当其冲的是 你向自己传递的信息First of all,the message you communicate to yourself,也就是自我认知理论说的self perception theory.但是同时 还有别人是如何看你的But also in terms of how other people perceive you.如果你握手是这样软绵绵的If you shake hands like this limply versus shake hands firmly,而不是这样坚定有力的握手your are communicating message to the person你在向与你握手的人传递某种信息with whom you are shaking your hands.那种信息最终会回到你这里And that message comes back right at you both in terms of一是通过别人对你的观感how they perceive you and that impacts you一是通过你的自我认知but also in terms of how you perceive yourself.你们知道 之前有个学生选了这门课You know one of the ex students from 1504.她当时是冰球队的She played,er..she was on the hockey team,去年毕业了 今年夏天我碰到她的时候just graduated last year.So I met her over the summer.她走过来 同我握手And she comes over.And she shakes my hand.然后我哭了 因为实在是太疼了And I was in tears.It hurt so much.我想她绝对是专心听课了And I thought she must have listened in class.所以千万不要太过分 坚定也得友好So don't exaggerate,just firm,nice.我是说真的 我觉得她把我的手骨I mean really I think she broke some of the bones in my hand.握碎了好几块 但是这真的很重要But it matters.因为握手传递了信息It communicates a message.我以后绝对不会找她的麻烦 永远不会You know I'm not gonna mess with her ever.我现在怕死她了I'm scared of her right now.这个握手传递的信息就是力量和信心It communicates a message of strength and confidence.如果我们走路时昂首阔步 我们在传递If we walk around proud,we're communicating a certain message.一种信息 如果我们走路时弯腰驼背If we walk around stooped,我们同样也是在向外界传递一种信息we're also communicating a message to the environment外界因此会给予我们回馈that then reflects on us,这种信息我们也会传递给自己but also to ourselves and that also reflects on us too.并产生自我回馈 最后我想给大家And finally,I must share a study with you.讲的是Hammerly做的研究This is by Hammerly.This is a study done...算了 我还是下次再讲这个研究you know what,actually I'm gonna leave that to next time因为我今天还有一些重要的事情要讲because I wanna get to something important.所以下节课一开始我就会讲这个研究So I'm gonna start next time with this,with this study.这个研究报告很长Because it's say,it's a long study.但是又很重要 所以下节课But it's a very important study.我要讲的第一件事就是这个研究So I will,I will talk about it next time first thing in class.今天下课前我还要讲一些内容I want to get to something before we end,这些内容足以改变我们的人际关系something that will change our relationship.弄假直到成真Fake it till you make it.David Myers在这个属于幸福心理学David Myers has done a lot of important work的领域里做了很多相关的研究in this area of positive psychology.他在研究中发现 很多时候即便我们是What he showed was it very often even if we act happy,假装快乐 假装很有自尊 像William Jameseven if we act with high self-esteem,说的假装高兴 我们的情绪也会因此改变even if I act joyful as William James said,that affects our mood问题来了:那我们怎么能全然为人呢The question now becomes what about permission to be human.好 首先 总有些时候Well,first of all,我们不想弄假直到成真there are times when we don't want to fake it till we make it,我们想要哭泣we wanna cry,我们想要难过 并表现出来we wanna be miserable and we wanna act that way.但是 同时 我们还得要However,we need to find准时出门 参加派对when is it the time to get out and to go to that party即便我们一点也不想出门even if it's the last thing in the world that I wanna do.这里的区别就在于积极接受And the difference here is about active acceptance.我仍然接受我的情绪I can still accept up my emotions.接受我的痛苦 并感受它I can still accept my pain and experience it同时选择用最适当 最对自己有益and still choose to act in accordance with how I deal more,的方式去面对most appropriate or most helpful.所以说 我能接受So I can accept the fact you know被女友抛弃这个现实 我能接受I was just dumped say by my girlfriend,自己感觉糟透了的现实 但是三天之后I can accept the fact that I feel terrible about it and awful照样出门到Oaks参加派对 疯玩一通but then three days later go out to Oaks and party,go wild.因此 正是因为脸部回馈假说So faking it again because of the facial feedback hypothesis因为身体回馈假说because of the body feedback hypothesis因为自我认知理论because of self-perception theory.行为影响了我的态度The behavior will affect my attitude.在Oakes狂欢一夜之后And after a crazy night out in Oaks,我实际上感觉好多了 也更健康了I will actually feel better and healthy.好吧健康不一定 但是感觉是好多了well,may be not,but better.下面我要播放一段Marva Collins的录像Here's a quick video of Marva Collins,当中她谈了一些自己的经历talking the,talking about some of her experiences."我觉得也许我现在这样是因为“I think that maybe what I am is my parents and their consistency我的父母和他们的坚持 我想要和他们一样成功I mean I wanted to be as successful as my parents,和我的祖父母一样成功my grandparents.在以前 成功的黑人是很少见的In those days,it was quiet rare to be black and to be successful所以我认为是我父母和祖父母的决心So I think the determination of my parents and grandparents,他们...我们会抬头挺胸they are...we would get chest high.我和比我小14岁的妹妹As I said I was 14 years older than my one sister.去教堂的时候 如果我们没有挺胸抬头But if we walked in church and didn't hold our heads up.我妈妈会说My mom would say,'你们今天这么了?老低着头走路?'‘what was wrong with you today walking with your head all down?'她会在我上学的时候She would scream down the street,在街上喊'抬起你的头来!'‘get your head up!' on my way to school.我常听见别人对她说People I've often heard them comment to her.'我一眼就能在操场找出你的小孩'I can always tell you child are on the playground.我们就是在这种骄傲的氛围里长大的"We were brought up the great sense of pride."抬起你的头 直着走 如果你仔细观察Get your head up,walk up straight when you watch Marva Collins.Marva Collins 你会发现她就是这么走路的That's how she walks.That's how she carries herself.她的姿势就是如此 并因此给她的学生和其他人And that communicates a message to her students也给她自己传递了一种信息to other people to herself.我现在要跳过一些内容I'm gonna jump to this point.所以大部分行为上的变化都是渐进式的So very often behavioral change is gradual.那什么是突发式变化呢So what is the acute change.突发式变化关注的是如何应对The acute change is about coping.关注的是承担风险It's about putting ourselves on the line.当我们去应对的时候And when we cope,我们需要冒险the important thing…when we to... it's to take risks.需要做一些不太愿意做的事It's to do something we don't feel comfortable doing.换句话说In other words,就是 离开舒适区 进入学习区it's about exiting our comfort zone and entering our stretch zone现在我要给大家讲两个我自己的故事Now what I wanna do now is share with you two stories from,这两个故事乍听起来毫不相干 但如果from my past,two stories that initially you will see unconnected大家听明白了的话 就会发现它们息息相关but as you will understand soon are very much connected.第一个故事不轻松 另一个也不轻松One a difficult story,the other a difficult story.我的第一个人生记忆My first memory.大家知道当人们开始记事的时候You know most people can,记得的第一件事就是most people have a first memory the first time第一个人生记忆when the first thing that you remember.我的第一个人生记忆是发生在My first memory is from September 1973.1973年9月 那时我快满三岁了I was almost 3 years old.那天是赎罪日 一年当中最神圣的一天And it was Yom Kippur the holiest day of the year.我记得我当时在家 突然电话响了And I remember being at home and suddenly the phone rings.我的父母是非常正统的教徒 我从小Now the phone my parents orthodox.I was raised orthodox.成长在正统的家庭里 我们的电话在安息日The phone never rings on Shabbat,on a Saturday;周六都不会响的 更不要说赎罪日了 但是let alone Yom Kippur.But the phone rings.这天电话响了Both of my parents.我记得他们当时跳了起来 向电话奔去I remember them jump up and run to the phone.我爸爸拿起了电话My dad picks it up.我当时站在父母中间And I'm standing between my parents.我爸爸看着我妈妈 小声说着什么He looks at my mom and said something whispering.我听不清 但是我看到我妈妈的脸色Couldn't hear what it was.But my mom's face changes.变了 我从她眼里看到了恐惧 我哭了起来And there's terror,fear in her eyes.And I begin to tear.我爸爸把我抱起来 他对我说And my dad picks me up我要离开几天 不过我会回来的and says I'm going for a few days but I'll be back.现在我知道当时发生了什么事Now I know what happens.当时 我父母接到我叔叔打来的电话So what happened was that my parents got a call from my uncle他当时在军队服役 在情报部门who at that time was doing his reserves in the military.他说战争爆发了He's in,he is in intelligence.And war had just broke out.在以色列一年当中最神圣的一天Young people at the holiest day of the year in Israel.年轻人 以色列军队The Israel military当时都不在边防线上is most of the people are not the boarders,are not protecting.完全出乎大家的意料It is a complete surprise,5个阿拉伯国家同时向以色列宣战5 Arab armies,launch a war against Israel.我爸爸把我放下来 走进他的房间My dad puts me down,goes to his room from the top of the ..一切仍历历在目 我看到他拿出自己的军装I still see him taking out his army uniform putting it on,穿好 拿出他的M16自动步枪 背好taking his M16 sub machine gun,putting it on,穿上鞋 系好鞋带putting on his shoes tieing them.我妈妈一直在他身边帮他整理And my mom all the while with him making him things.他们交谈当中偶尔会向我微笑一下They are talking once in a while smiling at me.但是我感到一种紧张不安 我不明白为什么But I sense a tension there.I don't know why.然后我们一起下楼走到我爸爸的车旁边We then walk down to my dad's car.他当时有一辆老式的绿色福特跑天下He had a tur- old turquoise Ford Cortina.他把鞋油拿出来 涂在车前灯上He takes shoe polish and paints the lights of the of the car.为什么呢 也是后来我才知道Why? Again later I know因为在夜里开车的时候 你开着车灯because at night when you drive with your lights on,车灯不能太亮 以防会遭到空袭you don't want the lights to be too bright in case of an air raid所以他涂了车灯 我就在一旁看着他So he paints the lights.And I watch him do all that.然后他把我抱起来 又一次的And then he picks me up and hugs me抱着我说 "我过几天就回来"and says once again “I'll be back in a few days."然后他上了车 我开始控制不住的哭泣He gets into his car.And I begin to sob uncontrollably.我们的邻居 SharlonOne of our neighbours whose name is Sharlon.他年岁太高不能服役He is too old to go into the army.他站在一边So he is standing there.我们一起看着我爸爸开车走了We all look at my dad going off in the car.他把我抱起来 我还在哭He picks me up.And I'm crying.他看着我说And he looks at me and says,"Tal 你长大以后想和爸爸一样'Tal,do you want to be a soldier like Aba,去当兵吗?"like your dad when you grow up?'我说 "我想"and I say,'Yes,I do.'他说 "那好 士兵是不会哭的" 于是我不哭了'Well,soldiers don't cry.' And I stopped crying.之后将近20年 我再也没哭过And I didn't cry for almost 20 years after that.我上了哈佛大学 我开始学心理学Then I came to Harvard.And I started to study psychology.你们知道我要讲什么是吧You know where I'm going,right? I started to study psychology.我开始学心理学And studying psychology,我知道自己想要做的I realized one of the things that I wanted to work on.想要做的最重要的事情之一One of the most important things that I wanted to work on就是找到自己女性化的一面was getting in touch with my feminine side,用荣的话说 就是阴和阳knowing Jung's language,the Yin and the Yang;雌雄同体the anima the animus.我想要找到自己女性化的一面是因为I wanted to be more in touch with of my feminine side我知道压抑情感是不健康的because I knew that it wasn't healthy to repress emotions.我压抑痛苦的情绪I was repressing painful emotions.同时也压抑积极正面的情绪The exact same thing happens with positive emotions.因为是同一条情绪通路Same emotional channels.但是我在一个非常强调男子气概的But I grew up in a culture that's very macho.文化环境中长大 男人不哭 士兵不哭Men don't cry.Or soldiers.Or tough.我们很坚强 可以搞定任何事情We can handle anything.这是我长大的文化背景And that's the culture that I grew up.而且 那是我人生的第一个回忆And again this was my first memory.之后我反复听过同样的话无数次I heard the same thing over and over and over again,传递的都是同样的讯息the same message.这样不行 表露情绪一点也不爷们It's not cool.It's not manly to show emotions.我现在想起来It reminds me up那时候我输掉了对于我来说最重要的after losing one of the most important squash tournaments for me,壁球比赛 全国冠军losing the national championships之前的一年我是冠军 当时我很震惊after I'd won it the year before.Surprise.我本不该输掉 本该赢的Wasn't supposed to lose it; was supposed to win.之后我和女朋友一起回家I go to my house with my girlfriend after.我们就是一起消磨时间And we're just hanging out.突然间她哭了起来And suddenly she begins to cry.我问她 "你哭什么?"And I say to her,'why are you crying?'她说 "我哭是因为你不哭"And she said,'I'm crying because you are not crying.'因为她明白这场比赛对于我有多重要Because she understood how important it was for me.这就是我在童年 青少年阶段的体验And this is how I basically experience my childhood,teenage,要坚强 要像个男人being tough,being macho.然后我来到这里 我明白我要释放出来And then I came here and understood I need to let go.我要找到自己女性化的一面I need to be more in touch with the feminine side.这就是我的第一个故事So this is story number one.现在让我来讲第二个故事Let me move on to story number two.我以前的一个学生 你们当中可能有人认识她One of the students that I had here,some of you may know her,她是04届毕业的 叫Lindsay Hydeclass of 04,was Lindsay Hyde.Lindsay Hyde在我这里学习Lindsay Hyde studied with me.我们也有一对一教学 经常一起学习We had one on one tutorial as well.We worked a lot together.Lindsay Hyde是'顽强女人顽强女生'Lindsay Hyde is the founder of 'Strong Women Strong Girls',组织的创始人 一个非常棒的组织wonderful organization part of PBHA.隶属于菲利普斯布鲁克斯内务协会She found it,now a national organization.现在已是全国性的组织 我也是筹款委员会I was also one of the funding board member of that organization.的一员 有兴趣的人可以去他们的网站Wonderful site swsg.org for those of you interested.swsg.org看看 Lindsay邀请我给I was invited by Lindsay to give a talk for'顽强女人顽强女生'的导师们做报告'Strong Women Strong Girls' for the mentors这些导师都是些哈佛学生 以及来自who were Harvard students as well as students from…波士顿其它院校的女会员other women from other colleges around Boston.于是我去做了一个报告 照片上的就是LindsayAnd I gave a talk.And here's Lindsay.这是她和一个三年级学生在一起 她She was with one of the students,3rd grade student,还有其他几位哈佛学生是这个学生的导师who she mentors and other Harvard students mentor他们一起做了很多很棒的事and do wonderful work.我非常相信这个机构的理念And I believe in this organization.几乎从筹备的最初阶段我就支持他们I support it from the from the get-go almost.And I gave a talk.所以我做了一个报告 这个报告是关于And the talk was about teaching the importance of role modeling,模范人物的重要性 关于诚实was about integrity.我跟他们讲了Marva CollinsI talked to them about Marva Collins讲了他们要做的重要工作and about the important work that they were doing.我觉得 对于我和所有与会者来说And at the end of the talk which went well,整个报告进行的非常顺利I think for myself for the participants,最后 我收到了一份表示感激的礼物I got a present,a gift a token of appreciation.礼物是一件衬衣And the present was a shirt.这可不是普通的衬衣It wasn't any shirt.是一件粉色的衬衣 这个颜色我平时It was a pink shirt,the color I don't normally wear.不穿 当然在以色列我从来没穿过Certainly I never wore it in Israel.因为这是一件'顽强女人顽强女生'衬衣Not only it was a pink shirt,it was,这衬衣不仅是粉色的 而且since it was the Strong Women Strong Girl shirt.尺码还很小It was also a very small shirt,给三年级学生穿应该比较合适more suited for the 3rd graders than for older ones.但是他们还是对我说But still they said,'我们希望你能收下这份表达我们谢意的礼物'' we wanted you to have it as a token of our appreciation.'然后我就犯了一个错误 我当然是在开玩笑And then I made a mistake.And I said jokingly of course.当时我在教1504课程 我开玩笑的说I was teaching 1504 at the time.'我会穿着这件衣服去上课的' 然后我笑了I said jokingly,'I will wear the shirt to class 'and laughed.这就是我收到的那件衬衫And here it is the shirt that I got.我在1504班上的另一个学生And then there was another student of mine from 1504,Tory Martin 她在Lindsay走后Tory Martin,who was who run the organization接管了这个机构 她当时是主席at that time took over from Lindsay at Harvard.Tory Martin说 '我会确保你兑现承诺的'And Tory Martin said,'I'm gonna hold you to it.'然后我又笑了 然后我差一点就哭了And I laughed and then almost cried.Becau..我说 '你什么意思?什么确保我兑现承诺'what do you what do you mean hold me to it.我是开玩笑的' 她说 '你看I mean I was joking.' She said,你不是刚给我们讲过诚实的重要性么''look,you just talk to us about the importance of integrity.'我的确是讲了 你们看 这里 诚实which I did,I mean look here,integrity.尽管这么靠后也能看见 我是讲了It's even behind.I did.I said,that's right,I did.我说 '好吧 我讲了 我现在怎么办'So what am I gonna go back on my word?'诚实可是我的核心价值之一That's one of my core values,integrity.然后我的眼前闪过了我的整个童年And then my whole childhood flashed before my eyes.然后我就想到了丘吉尔说过的一句话And I thought about something that Churchill said'在逆境中寻找转机'which was 'find opportunity in difficulty.'于是我一直在寻找转机So I looked for the opportunity.现在转机来了 就在这件粉色衬衫上And here it was an opportunity handed to me in a pink shirt,让我找到自己女性化的一面to be more in touch with my feminine side.女士们 先生们 2008年春装展So ladies and gentlemen.Spring fashion 2008.[音乐][MUSIC]我懂 我懂的 你们也许不会相信Now I know I know you're gonna find this hard to believe.但还是相信我 当我说But believe me这个对于我来说是在我的舒适区之外when I say that this for me was going out of my comfort zone.实际上这已经都不在我的学习区之内了In fact maybe it was going out from my stretch zone a little bit,已经到我的恐慌区了but into my panic zone.上课之前 备课的时候I was telling the TFs before class that你们知道我都是要做笔记的when I prepared for this class.所以我在这里写下要干什么You know I have,I have all my notes you know.我跟助教们说And here I write.我刚写进笔记的时候 每次看过去Every time I went over it,when I initially wrote it on my notes.我都感到肾上腺素在胃里飙升It was like a ...adrenalin rush in my stomach,这就是在舒适区之外going out of my comfort zone.现在我也是在舒适区之外Now I'm also out of my comfort zone这就是为什么我要在下课前which is why I have to have it at the end of the class而不是刚上课的时候干这件事as opposed to the beginning of class.关键是要达到最适度的不适感But the key is to attain optimum levels of discomfort.我可能的确是有点太吓人了I may have a little overshock a little bit.但是关键是最适度的不适感But the key is optimum levels of discomfort.为什么呢?想要改变 别无他法And why? There is no other way to change.我可以想一天想破头I can think about it all day long一直说我要找到女性化的一面and say I want to be in touch with my feminine side我要更勇敢 我要释放出来or I want to be more courageous,I want to get out.我可以想一整天I can think about it all day long.什么也不会发生的Nothing will happen.什么也不会发生的Nothing will happen除非我们有真正的实质的行为改变unless we bring about real actual behavioral change,真正的实质的行为动作real actual behavioral action.当我们做到这一点的时候 天高任鸟飞And when we do that,then the sky is the limit.谢谢大家 下周四再见Thank you.I will see you on Thursday.
