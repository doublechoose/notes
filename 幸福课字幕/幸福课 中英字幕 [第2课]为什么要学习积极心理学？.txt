幸福课 中英字幕 [第2课]为什么要学习积极心理学？
早上好
Hi. Good morning.
很高兴你们都来了
I'm so glad that you came.
我还担心在这种天气没人会来
I was worried that no one would show up in this weather.
很高兴你们都很好
I'm glad you are Ok.
首先做几个声明
Just a couple of announcements.
我通过邮件收到的几个问题
Questions that I received via email.
在开始课程之前我要说的几件事情
A few things before we jump into the material.
首先 有人问我"这门课程是为谁设置的?"
First of all,I was asked,"who is this class for?
"这是积极心理学"
Is it for people-- you know it's positive psychology --
"它是为非常不开心的人设置的吗?"
people that are very unhappy?
"它只是为抑郁的人设置的吗?"
Is it only for people who are depressed?
"这门课程是为谁设置的?"
who is this class for?"
这门课程的授课对象是
Well,the class is for anyone who is interested in
对积极心理学有兴趣的人及想更开心的人
Positive psychology and anyone who wants to be happier.
如果你非常开心 你还可以更开心
If you are extremely happy,you can still be happier.
如果你非常不开心 你也可以更开心
If you are very unhappy,you can still be happier.
所以这门课程适合任何
so the class essentially is for anyone
对它感兴趣的人
who's interested in the material-
我会邀请有兴趣投入
and I would add someone who is really interested to work,
我们上次谈到的那种努力的人上来
to put the kind of effort that we talked about last time.
你不需要投入那种
Just not the kind of effort that we would require you to
为了明白某个概念而大为头痛的努力
wreck your head about understanding certain concept,
而是努力把这些观念融入你的生活
but it is effort in terms of applying these ideas to your lives.
也许你之所以上这门课程
Now you may want to take this class,
是因为你对积极心理学的理论感兴趣
because you are interested on academic level in positive
这也没问题
psychology that's perfectly fine.
你将会得到很多...
And you'll get many--
我们每节课都会谈到非常多的研究
we'll talk about numerous studies in every lecture,
从下节课开始
starting next time.
我们将接二连三地谈到那些研究
We'll talk about study after study after study,
所以你也可以得到理论方面的知识
so you'll get that element as well.
但是 如果你修积极心理学
However,if you are thinking about taking positive psychology
是为了个人利益 那么你就需要努力
for personal benefits,you need to put the effort in.
对此今天我会作进一步的阐述
And I'll talk more about that today.
所以这门课程任何人都可以修
So the class is for everyone.
包括那些非常开心而且想更开心的人
Anyone who's extremely happy and wants to be happier,
及那些不开心但是想更开心的人
and anyone who's not happy and wants to be happier.
考试成绩 这不是个问题
Pass/fail-- perfectly fine.
这门课程的宗旨以你们的利益为上
Again the idea about this class is first and foremost for you.
所以我建议如果你想及格
So I would urge you if you do take pass
那么就要努力
and fail to put in the work,
因此是否及格的决定因素之一
and that's why the one element of pass/fail is not negotiable is
就是所有的回应报告必须交上来
that all the response papers have to be submitted.
回应报告不会评分
Now the response papers,as you know,are not graded.
它们基本上就是心得体会
They are basically reflection papers.
也就是你会思考能够融入
Will you reflect about the ideas about things
你的生活的想法和事情吗?
that can be applied to your life?
它们是必需要交的
But they are required.
你交上来 你就及格
So you hand them in,you pass.
不交就不及格
If you don't hand them in,you fail.
除此之外
But other than that,by all means,
如果你想参加考试 那也没问题
if you want to take this class pass/fail,it's perfectly fine.
第三件事
Third thing,
在这门课程你将会接触很多理论和观点
you'll be exposed to many theories,to many ideas in this class.
不是所有理论观点都会引起你的共鸣
Not everything would resonate of you.
2008年出版了一本很棒的书
There's a wonderful book just came out in 2008,
就在两周前 书名叫《快乐之道》
just two weeks ago,called "The How of Happiness"
它由Sonja Lyubomirsky所著
by Sonja Lyubomirsky.
在书中她谈到了一个概念...
And there she talks about the concept--
她是加州大学河滨分校的教授
she's a professor at Riverside (UC),
哈佛大学的毕业生 斯坦福大学的研究生
Harvard college graduate and went to Stanford for graduate school
她谈到了找到"适合"的重要性
she talks about the importance of finding fit,
63
也就是某种方法
meaning the fit between certain technique,
某种工具 某种观点是否适合你
or tool,or idea,and yourself.
并不是你听到的每种观点
Not every idea,
每种研究
not every study that you've heard about,
以及你运用的每种介入方法...
not every intervention that you actually practice
你在生活中将会运用介入方法
and you will practice interventions in your life,
不管是作善举
whether it's doing acts of kindness,
还是表达感激
whether it's expressing gratitude,
还是体育锻炼 还是写日记
whether it's physical exercising,whether it's journaling.
这些事情你在整个学期里都要做
You will do all these things throughout the semester.
然而并不是一切都适合你
Not everything would be right for you.
你将会接触它
You'll be exposed to it.
尝试它
You'll try it.
然后你将作出决定
And then you'll make up your mind,
"对 我想把它融入到生活中"
"yes,this is what I want to incorporate"
或者"不 它对我没什么意义"
or "no,this is just not relevant for me."
所以记住这一点很重要
So it's important to keep that in mind.
我所说的一切都有研究论证
Anything that I talk about is backed by research,
但是研究没有说它适合所有人
but the research doesn't say it's right for everyone.
它说这对于大多数人或者对于很多人
It says it's for most people or for many people;
都有作用或者正在起作用
this has worked or it is working.
所以你要积极参与到课程中
So again be an active participant in this class
而非某种学说的被动接受者
as opposed to passive recipient of a doctrine.
鉴别哪些东西适合你...不是一切东西
And identify the things that work for you-- not everything.
我敢说并非一切东西都适合你
I guarantee not everything will work for you,
但是有很多东西会适合你
but a lot of things will.
关于我之前提到的回应报告
Your response papers that I just mentioned earlier:
它们在下午五点钟就要交 很抱歉
they are due at 5 pm,sorry,
从下周二开始你将在每周二下午五点收到
you'll get them by 5 pm on Tuesday,starting next Tuesday.
然后在周日下午五点前交到你的任务组
And they will be due at 5 pm on Sunday to your TF.
回应报告对大多数人来说
Again the response papers are usually for most people fun,
都是有趣而好玩的活动
interesting and engaging activities.
它不会评分 它让你去思考
Not graded,just basically for you to reflect,
并通过它们去成长
for you to grow through them.
要写论文的人
Thesis writers.
你们中有多少人要写论文?
How many of you are thesis writers?
请举手让我看看
Just so I get a show of hand here.
好的 很抱歉 我没有在开玩笑
Ok,I am sorry. No I'm kidding.
要写论文的人 你们不用参加期中考试
Thesis writers: you'll not need to take the midterms.
我知道那段时间里非常紧张...
I know it's crunch time around that time-
我自己也经历过那段时期
being through it myself here.
所以你们不用参加期中考试
So you'll not have to take the midterm.
你的期末考占更多分数
Your final will account for more.
除非你想参加期中考试
Unless you want to take the midterm,
当然我们非常欢迎你参加
of course you'll more than welcome to.
我们不会把你扔到教室外面
we won't throw you out of the classroom.
写论文的人可以不用参加
Your thesis writers may.
网上将会有很多公告
There'll be many announcements online.
请经常查看网站
Do check the website on the regular basis.
我们会发布很多东西 而不是向你发邮件
We communicate a lot of things. Instead of sending you emails,
我们会发布公告
we'll have the announcements.
需要经常查看一下 大概每天六七次
Check them regularly,about 6 7 times a day.
这只是开玩笑
Just kidding.
一两天一次就已经足够了
Once a day or once every two days is more than enough.
在开始课程之前...
I'd like Before I do jump into the material
今天的课程非常令人兴奋
and we have a very exciting lecture today,
我们会邀请进修学院任务组组长Deb Levy
to invite Deb Levy who is the head TF for extension school--
哈佛进修学院的同学们
so extension school students,
我知道该学院的一些同学在这里
I know there are a couple of you here,
还有一些在家里...
those of you at home--
有请 Deb Levy
here she is. Deb Levy.
00:06:13,050 --&gt; 00:06:14,280
好的
Deb Levy:Alright.
我大概有二三十分钟的发言时间
I have about 20,30 minutes to talk
所以我会从我小时候讲起...这只是开玩笑
so I'm gonna start with my childhood. I am just kidding.
我是进修学院的任务组组长 我们很激动
I am the head TF for the extension school and we are thrilled.
进修学院有296名学生在选修这门课程
We have 296 extension students taking this course online,
也就是说他们会收看视频
which means they are going to watch videos,
进修学院的学生们
and then extension students
你们会参加电话会议
you'll be in sections on teleconference,
人们会打电话进来
When people are gonna call in,
所以我们将会有电话会议
there are gonna be teleconferences
这是个很好的机会
which is going to be a great opportunity.
我们跟新西兰的人打声招呼
Let's say hi to people out there in New Zealand.
还有法国的 肯塔基州的 莱克星顿的人
Hi. France. Kentucky. Lexington.
真是难以置信
It's really unbelievable.
另一件事就是 我想拍一张照片
So the other thing is I want to take a picture actually.
教室里不准拍照
(Tal: No pictures in the classroom.)
也给你拍一张 Tal
You'll take a picture Tal.
我不会授课
So I am not going to do any lecturing.
但是Tal和我有着相似的系统知识
But since Tal and I have very similar systematic stuff,
所以如果Tal因某种原因缺席的话
so if Tal is absent for any reason,
我会代你授课
I'll be doing the lecture for you.
很好
(Tal: Good.)
另一件事就是 进修学院的学生们
The other is: people who are extension,
希望你们要耐心点
I want to you be patient.
我们会尽快把信息发出去
We are going to get information out there as soon as we can.
大概下周你们就会分组
And you'll all be sectioned in next week or so.
能来这里真是太激动了
And feel thrilled to be here.
好的 谢谢你 Deb
Great. Thank you Deb.
我想以一个故事开始今天的课程
So I want to start with a story,
那是两年前发生在我身上的事
something that happened to me exactly 2 years ago,
恰好两年
just about to the day,
那是我上次教积极心理学的最后一节课
when was the last time when I taught positive psychology.
那学期开始的时候
As the semester started,
同时那是压力很大的一个时期 我的导师
it was a very stressful period also,my mentor,
我要把这节课程
who I am dedicating this class as well as
以及将来的积极心理学课程献给
all my future positive psychology class is to,
在课程开始前一天去世的Philip Stone
Philip Stone passed away just the day before the class started.
那时候我压力非常大
Very stressful period.
我生病了 病得非常严重
And I got sick. And I got very sick.
然而我还是上完了课
Somehow I got through the class.
我教授周四的课程 它从两年前开始
I taught the Thursday class. That started 2 years ago.
课程在周二上
It started on Tuesday. So I taught on Tuesday.
后来改为周四 我服了很多药
Somehow Thursday,completely drugged.
然而我还是上完了课
This lecture I made it through somehow.
我回家后无法入睡
And I went to home  and I couldn't fall asleep.
我感到非常痛 所以我去看医生了
I was in real pain. I went to the doctors.
那是周五下午 我说
That was on Friday afternoon,just saying
"我必须要看医生 我服的药不起作用"
"you know I have to go. The medication I took didn't help."
我去看了医生 验了血
Went to the doctors. Had some blood tests.
几天无法入睡之后
And finally after days I couldn't sleep
由于痛苦我终于睡着了
because of pain,fell asleep.
那是周五晚上
This was Friday night.
午夜的时候电话响了
In the midnight,there was a phone call.
我没有去接 我很快睡着了
I don't hear it. I am fast asleep.
我的妻子Tommy拿起了话筒
My wife picks it up. Tommy picks it up.
那是医生打来的
It's the doctor.
医生对Tommy说
And the doctor says to Tommy,
结果出来了
"the test results just came in.
Tal要立刻到医院来
And Tal should get to the hospital now."
她对医生说
She said to the doctor,
他刚睡着 他几天没睡了
"He just fell asleep. He hasn't slept for days.
能不能等到明天再去?
Can it wait til tomorrow morning?"
医生说 不行 他要到Beth Israel医院
And the doctor said,"No. And he has to go to Beth Israel,
那里有最好的实验室可以给他提供治疗
because they have the best labs for what he needs right now."
她没有再说
And she doesn't elaborate it any more.
Tommy叫醒了我 告诉我发生的事
Tommy wakes me up,retells me the story of what's happening.
我起来了
Somehow I get up.
她不能带我去医院 因为David
She can't take me to the hospital because David,
当时他才一岁 他正在睡觉
at that time one year old,is asleep.
我们不想叫醒他
We don't want to wake him up.
我们叫了一辆计程车带我到Beth Israel医院
So we get a cab to take me to Beth Israel.
路上...这是我不做
On the way-- so this was the year
Leverett的常驻导师资格的第二年
after I was no longer resident tutors in Leverett.
我们驶经查尔斯河
We were (?),driving down the Charles River.
然后我们经过哈佛
Up and drive and then next to Harvard.
我当时看着哈佛 看着美丽的河
I look at Harvard. I look at the beautiful river.
四周静悄悄
It's very quiet.
周五午夜之后没有多少车辆
Not many cars just after midnight on a Friday night.
我情不自禁地想
And I can't help myself but think,
如果情况真的很严重呢?
"what if there's something really terrible going on?"
他们为什么午夜叫我去医院
I mean,why would they call me midnight to the hospital--
还指定是Beth Israel医院?
Beth Israel,insisting on just one specific hospital?
一定是出了很严重的问题
There must be something really wrong.
我开始思考
And my mind begins to wander.
我说
And I say,
如果我只剩下一年时间呢? 我在这一年里会做什么?
"what if I only have a year left? What would I do in that year?"
我变得非常伤心 因为我看不到David长大
I become very sad because I think I won't see David grow up.
我以后再也不会有孩子
I won't see-- I won't have any future children.
在上面要小心谨慎
Be careful up there.
我变得十分忧郁悲伤
And I become very wistful and sad.
然后我问自己 好的 在职业上
And then I ask myself,"Ok so professionally,
我在最后一年想做什么?
what would I want to do in that last year?"
我知道在生活在我要做什么
So I know personally exactly what I'll do.
我会用所有时间和家人一起度过
I'll spend all the time that I can with my family.
但是在职业上在这一年我想完成什么?
But professionally what do I want to accomplish in this year?
我的第一反应就是
And my immediate response was
我要留下一个系列的课程
I want to leave behind a coherent body of work,
一个向人们介绍积极心理学的系列课程
a coherent course introducing people to positive psychology.
我到达医院之后再进行了一些检查
While I arrived at the hospital,I had some more checks.
结果是没什么严重情况
It ends up being nothing too serious.
他们让我服抗生素
They put me on antibiotics.
几天之内我就开始复原了
And within a couple of days I am on the way to recovery.
但是今天我要和你们探讨
I want to share with you today though why.
为什么对我最重要的事情...
Why is it the most important thing for me
那时和现在都是如此
at that time and still today,
就是留下一系列
is to leave behind a coherent body of work
关于积极心理学的课程
about positive psychology,
向你们介绍这个奇妙的领域?
to introduce you to this wonderful field?
为什么是积极心理学?为什么是这个领域?
Why positive psychology?Why is it? Its own field?
为什么不只是研究
Why is it not--well,just study happiness,
社会心理学或临床心理学的幸福?
wellbeing as part of social psychology or clinical psychology?
为什么世界上这么多学者
Why have so many scholars around the world
都在研究积极心理学这个概念?
united around this concept of positive psychology?
这是我今天要说的
So this is what I want to do today.
2000年 David Myers做了一项研究
In the year of 2000,a research was done by David Myers.
霍普学院的David Myers 你们当中学过
Davis Myers,from Hope College-- some of you
社会心理学的可能读过他的书
who've studied social psychology may have read his textbook,
他做了心理学概念方面的研究
did research,looking at psychological abstracts.
他研究的是
What he looked at was the ratio
"消极研究"和"积极研究"之间的比率
between "negative research" and "positive research".
这是他的研究结果
Here is what he found.
从1967年到2000年
From 1967 to year of 2000-
这是积极心理学的形成期
this was around the time when positive psychology started,
他发现在这33年里有5000篇文章研究愤怒
what he found in the 33 years are over 5000 articles on anger,
5000篇文章研究愤怒
5000 research articles on anger.
超过41000篇文章研究焦虑
He found over 41000 research articles on anxiety
还有超过54000篇研究抑郁
and over 54000 articles on depression.
然后他看看积极的概念 积极的研究
And then he looked at the positive words,positive research.
他寻找关于快乐的研究
He looked for research on joy.
他仅仅找到了415篇研究
And he found staggering 415 studies.
情况会有所改善
It does get better.
他寻找关于幸福的研究
He looked at research on happiness
他发现在33年里有接近2000篇文章研究幸福
and he found close to 2000 articles on happiness in 33 years.
生活满意度研究最多 超过2500篇研究文章
Life satisfaction came on top: over 2500 studies.
但是 如果你看看
Still,if you look at that,
消极研究和积极研究的对比
the negative studies versus the positive studies,
你得到的比率是21比
the ratio that you get is 21 to 1.
每份研究某个积极方面
For every one article on some positive aspect,
积极因素的文章
some positive element of life,
不管是研究健康 满意程度 快乐还是幸福
wellbeing,satisfaction,joy,happiness,
都有21份消极方面的文章 包括抑郁 焦虑
you get 21 articles on depression,anxiety,
精神分裂 神经衰弱等等
schizophrenia,neurosis and so on.
21比1的比率
Ratio of 21 to 1.
我得承认这是非常令人郁闷的比率
Very depressing ratio,I must admit.
实际上它让我非常生气和忧虑
In fact,it made me very angry and anxious.
那些研究主要集中于不起作用的东西上
Studies focus on,primarily on what doesn't work,
大部分都是这样 而且这也不是新现象
mostly on what doesn't work. And this is not a new phenomenon.
这是Abraham Maslow写的一些东西
Here is something from Abraham Maslow,
我们上次提到过他
who we mentioned last time,
他在1954年谈到过这种现象
talking about this phenomenon in 1954:
"心理学这一学科对于消极方面的研究"
"The science of psychology has been far more successful
"远比对于积极方面的研究成功"
on the negative than on the positive side.
"它向我们展示了人类的短处"
It has revealed to us much about man's shortcomings,
"他的缺点 他的过失"
his illnesses,his sins,
"但很少谈到他的潜能 他的长处"
but little about his potentialities,his virtues,
"他的实际愿望或精神高度"
his achievable aspirations or his psychological height.
"好像心理学自愿固步自封"
It is as if psychology had voluntarily restricted itself to only
"让自己仅限于研究黑暗低劣的一半"
half its rightful jurisdiction and that darker,meaner half."
心理学研究什么?
So what does psychology study?
学心理学的人
I mean the psychology concentrators here know that,
可能会猜
probably guess that.
我们大量地研究偏见
We study a lot of prejudice.
我们大量地研究抑郁和焦虑
We study a lot depression and anxiety.
我们大量地研究相似性
We study a lot about conformity.
我们大量地研究判断错误和过失
We study a lot about misjudgments and errors,
大概就是专门研究这方面而很少...
very much focusing on this aspect and very little--
21比1的比率表明很少研究积极方面
again,21 to 1,very little-- on the positive.
看到这个比率时 我想
And when I look at this ratio and I think about it,
那是1954年 到现在也没多大改变
this is 1954-- hasn't changed much since.
当我思考它调查它的时候
And when I think about it and I look into it,
我觉得心理学需要帮助
I think that psychology needs help.
我真的这样觉得
I really do.
你可以从个人的角度想想它
I mean think about it at a personal level.
如果一个人一天里有21小时感到消沉
that if you had a person who 21 hours a day was depressed
而只有一个小时感觉良好会怎样?
and one hour in a day felt good?
或者有一天感觉良好 便有21天觉得焦虑
Or one day feeling good and then 21 days feeling anxious
和消沉会怎样?
and depressed?
你会说这个人需要帮助
You would say that this person would need help.
我觉得这个领域需要帮助
And the field I think,needs help.
但问题是 这是正确的比喻吗?
But the question becomes "is it the right analogy?"
我们应该这样去看待它吗?
Should we look at it this way?
因为21比1的比率是不健康的
Because the 21 ratio is unhealthy,
从个人的角度来看肯定也是这样
certainly would be so on the individual level,
但是它从多个角度反映了现实
but it reflects reality in many ways.
因为我们今天所看到的
Because what we are seeing today
是越来越多的研究表明
in more and more research showing that there is more and more
世界上出现了越来越多的抑郁症
depression around the world,
还有越来越多的焦虑 东南西北
that there is more and more anxiety,east,west,north,south--
世界各地
around the world.
有些人会争辩道...
And one could argue--
那些主张继续研究这片领域
people who argue for continuing to do research in this area,
而少点研究积极心理的人认为
for doing less in positive psychologies,--
我们应该让这个比率大于21比
well we should be doing even more than the 21 to 1 ratio,
因为我们想缓和人们受到的
because we want to alleviate the anxiety
焦虑和抑郁
and depression that people experience.
今天的抑郁症病例比1960年高十倍
Today depression is 10 times higher than it was in 1960.
部分的原因是人们的意识程度高了
Now part of it is because there's more awareness,
我们对抑郁症的诊断更准确
because we measure better.
但这并非全部原因
But that's not all.
还因为抑郁症在客观上增加了
It's also simply because objectively there's more depression.
其中的一种迹象就是 最客观的"诊断"
And one way of knowing that is that the most objective "measure"
不幸的是 就是自杀
that we have is unfortunately suicide.
自杀人数在世界范围内明显上升
And numbers have risen significantly around the world,
327
不仅是在美国
not just in the United States--
不管是在中国 澳大利亚还是这里
whether it's in China,whether it's Australia-- as well as here.
现在抑郁症人群的平均年龄小于15岁
The mean age for depression today is less than 15.
孩子们在很小的时候就接触了
Kids at very young age are introduced to the
信息高速公路
"information highway".
通常来说他们都没有准备好
And very often,they are not prepared,
他们无法有效地应对它
not able to deal with it in an effective way.
所以当我们看到这个数据时
So when we look at this data,
我们认为我们需要更多的研究帮助人们
we say we do need more research to help people
克服抑郁症 克服焦虑
overcome depression,to help people overcome anxiety.
这应引起足够的重视
And I don't want to belittle that.
这非常重要 极度的重要
That is important. It is extremely important.
我主张的
What I'm arguing,what I will argue for,
是天平的偏移
is the shift of the pendulum.
这样它将不会再是21比
So it's no longer 21 to 1.
要有更多的研究关于积极心理学
There are more,many more studies in positive psychology,
不是要只研究它 根本不是
-- not to the exclusion of,not at all,
而是让天平偏移一点
but just shifting the pendulum.
这里的情况如何?
How about here?
我们的象牙塔里的情况如何?
In our local village?
有一篇文章...我无法找到更新的研究
This article,-- I couldn't find a study that is more recent,
它是在2004年发表的
this was published in 2004.
《哈佛克里姆森》
Harvard Crimson (http://www.thecrimson.com/).
这篇文章说 经过他们6个月的研究
This article says that,in their 6 months study of this,
哈佛大学八成的学生在过去一年
80% of Harvard students experienced depression
都经历过抑郁期
over the past year.
我们说的不是大多数人一天里
Now we are not talking about the regular ups and downs
经常出现的情绪起伏 我也是如此
that most people have ten times a day-- I certainly do.
我们说的是抑郁
We are talking about depression here.
它会持续一段时间
For an extended period of time.
根据这份研究 47%的哈佛学生...
47% of Harvard students,according to this,--
这不是学术研究
and grant it: this is not academic study,
但是我待会就和你们分享学术研究
but I will share with you academic study in a minute,
它发表在高级期刊上
published in a top-tier refereed journal.
但是克里姆森里的研究表明
But Crimson has founded in its survey
47%的哈佛学生在过去一年
that 47% Harvard students over the past year
经历过无法正常生活学习的抑郁期
have experienced depression to the point of not functioning.
他们无法出门
So they couldn't leave home.
他们要痛苦地度日
They were really struggling to just basically get through the day.
47%的人
47%.
人们看到这个数据的时候 他们说
Now when people look at this,they say
"当然了 我们要努力研究精神病理学"
"well of course,we need to focus more on psychopathology.
"21比1还不足够 30比1才像样"
21 to 1-- not enough! 30 to 1 sounds more like it."
这样的情况各个校园都有
We see it around campuses.
而不仅仅是哈佛
This is not peculiar to Harvard.
绝对不是哈佛才有的现象
Not at all peculiar to Harvard.
Richard Kadison
Richard Kadison,
他是这里的心理健康服务中心的领导
who is the head of mental health services here,
他最近在医学领域的领先杂志
in the New England Journal of Medicine--
《新英格兰医学杂志》上
probably the leading journal in the field of Medicine,
发表了一篇文章
recently published an article,
他谈到了一项调查
where he talked about a survey
调查对象是全国13500名大学生
that was done among 13500 college students nationwide,
他们来自不同类别的学院
different kinds of colleges,
大学 公立学校 私立学校
universities,states schools,private schools.
他们在这项重要的研究里发现
And what they found in this very significant study
全国45%的大学生在过去一年
was that 45% of college students nationwide over the past year
经历过无法正常生活学习的抑郁期
have experienced depression to the point of not functioning.
《哈佛克里姆森》的数据是47%
So The Harvard Crimson found 47;
在全国范围的数据是45% 基本上是一样
nationwide,it was 45-- essentially identical,
两者之间的差异并不大
no significant difference among the two.
这是一个全国性的现象
This is a nationwide phenomenon.
这份研究表明
In this study,
全国94%的大学生感到压抑
94% of college students nationwide feel overwhelmed
因为他们必须要做的事而不堪负重
and stressed by everything that they have to do.
94%
94%.
这本应该是我们一生中最美好的四年
I mean these are supposed to be the best four years of our lives.
事情不对劲
Something is going on here.
不仅是美国才有这种现象
Now this is not unique to United States.
我最近刚从一次游历回来
I just recently came back from a tour.
我到了欧洲 包括英国 法国
I was in-- spent time in Europe-- in the UK,France;
我在中国逗留了很久 也去了澳洲
spent a lot of time in China and some time in Australia.
所有这些地方
In every one of these places,
政府都非常担忧...
the governments are really concerned;
大学校长们都非常担忧
university presidents are very concerned
越来越多的抑郁现象
about the growing level of depression,
焦虑 精神紊乱
anxiety and general mental disorder,
自杀率的上升 上面提到的所有国家都是如此
rise of suicide rates in all of these countries that I mentioned.
所以这是全球性流行病
So we have a global epidemic here.
我们再看看 21比1的比率是好事吗?
And once again going back so: Is it the 21:1 ratio good?
它重要吗?它不是应该扩大吗?
Is it important? Shouldn't it be increased?
我们怎么可以去研究幸福
How can we even think about studying happiness
健康 爱和快乐?
and well-being and love and joy?
我们不是应该首先处理
Shouldn't we first deal with
真正迫切的问题吗? 比如抑郁
the real pressing problem of depression,
焦虑 神经衰弱等等
anxiety,neurosis and so on?
这样说确实有些道理
--Some truth to that,
但是在这个课程里我要主张的是
but again what I'm going to argue for in this class
我们也要...
is that we do need to also,
不是专门 也不用主要
not only,not exclusively,not even necessarily primarily,
我们也要集中研究积极心理学
we need to also focus on the positive.
我要说三个为什么应该这样做的理由
I am going to talk about three reasons why we should do that.
首先 集中研究有用的东西至关重要
The first reason is that it is important to focus on what works,
因为有用的或者集中研究的会成为现实
because what works or what we focus on rather creates reality.
如果我们集中研究起作用的
If we focus on what is working,
它就会在世界起更大的作用
we'll have more working in our world,
在我们身上以及关系上起更大作用
more working in ourselves,more working in our relationships.
其次 为什么积极心理学
The second reason why positive psychology
作为一门独立领域的研究学科
as an independent field of study as a course in
是重要的 这是因为快乐
and of itself is important is that being happy
并非只是对痛苦的否定
is not just the negation of happiness.
摆脱我正在经历的
It doesn't mean just get rid of depression or anxiety
抑郁或者焦虑并不意味着
that I am experiencing,
我同时就变得快乐了
I spontaneously become happy.
情况并非是这样 问题不会这样被解决
That's not the case. That's not how it works.
最后 预防在今天来说非常重要
And finally,prevention which is very important today,
预防困苦最有效的方法...
the most effective way of preventing hardship,
不管是抑郁还是焦虑
-- whether it's depression,whether it's anxiety,
实际上是通过专注于培养积极心态
-- is actually by focusing on and cultivating the positive.
我会跟你们分享一些关于这点的研究
Now I will share with you some studies about this.
这三个原因表明我们需要积极心理学
So for these three reasons,we need positive psychology.
我从专注于有效方法的重要性开始
Let me begin with the importance of focusing on what works.
在《积极心理学手册》的序言里
In the introduction to the Handbook of Positive Psychology,
我们上次提到的Martin Seligman...
Martin Seligman who we talked about last time,
他被认为是积极心理学之父
considered the father of positive psychology,
影响了很多学者 他说
network of scholars,says this:
"积极心理学的目标是促成一种变化"
"The aim of positive psychology is to catalyze a change
"让心理学从只关注补救生活中最糟糕的事"
in psychology from a preoccupation only with repairing the worst
"到同时建立生活中最美好的事"
things in life to also building the best qualities in life."
请留意他说的是同时
Note that he says also.
他没有说专门 甚至没有说主要
He doesn't say exclusively or even primarily.
专注于研究有效的东西至关重要
It's important to focus on what works,
不管是对我们的关系 对我们自身
-- whether it is in our relationship,whether it's in ourselves,
对其他人 对哈佛
whether it's in others,whether it's in Harvard,
对美国还是对世界而言
whether it's in United States or the world--
这是为了获得更多有效的东西
in order to have more what works.
问题是"如何专注于研究有效的东西?"
Now the question is "how do we focus on what works?"
这个问题的答案
And the answer to this question
就在我们提出的问题的本身
is through the questions that we ask.
我通过一个案例研究来阐明这点
Let me illustrate through a case study.
心理学家在20世纪40年代末开始
Psychologists,starting in the late 1940s,
研究受危人群
studied at-risk population.
越来越多的钱 政府资金 大学资金
More and more money-- government money,university money,
慈善基金都投入到研究城市或地区里
philanthropist money-- went into study in the cities or places
所谓的受危儿童的身上
where generally the kids were considered at risk--
他们更容易退学
more prone to dropping out of school,
以后更容易犯罪 少女妊娠等等
more prone to later-on crime,teen pregnancy and so on.
他们为这项研究投入了大量金钱
So this study they put in a lot of money,
大量的精力
a lot of effort into this.
心理学家们问的问题是
The question that the psychologists asked was
"为什么这些人会失败"
"why do these individuals fail?
00:25:47,760 --&gt; 00:25:50,240
"为什么受危人群中"
why does such a high percentage of students in
"有如此高比例的学生退学?"
that as-risk population end up dropping out of school?
"怀孕?犯罪?"
Getting pregnant? Crime?"
我们下周再谈统计数据
--And we'll talk about the statistics later on next week.
"为什么他们当中有这么多人会失败?"
"Why do so many of these individuals fail?"
他们提出了很重要的问题
Now an important question,
心理学家们动机良好 头脑灵活 投入了很多钱
good intentions of the psychologists,smart people,lot of money,
投入了很多资源
lot of resources going in.
然而 变化却非常少
However,very little change was introduced.
这些研究带来的变化微乎其微
Very little change came about as results of these studies.
很多地区的情况继续恶化
And the situation in many areas continued to exacerbate.
情况没有任何好转 虽然动机良好
Certain didn't get any better,despite the good intentions,
虽然资源充足 虽然人们头脑灵活
despite the resources,despite the brain power
它们都被投入去研究这个问题
that twined into the researching into this question.
得到的答案却非常有意思
Interesting answers--
我们需要更好的教育 更好的建筑
well,we need better education,we need better buildings,
更多的资源
we need more resources,
但是实际上发生的变化很少
but very little change actually in practice came about.
然后出现了一种范式
And then there was a paradigm,
20世纪80年代出现了范式转移
quite literally a paradigm shift in the 1980s.
通过Antonovsky的努力 我上次提到过他
Through the work of Antonovsky who I mentioned last time
今天我要再次提到他 通过Antonovsky
and I'll mention again today,through the work of Antonovsky,
及Ellen Langer和Alice Isen等其他人的努力
and other people like Ellen Langer,other people like Alice Isen,
心理学家们提出了不同的问题
different questions started to be asked by psychologists.
他们不去问为什么这些人会失败
Instead of asking what did these individuals fail,
积极心理学家开始问是什么让某些人
positive psychologists started to ask what made some individuals
成功了?即便面对的是不理想的环境?
succeed despite unfavorable circumstances?
也许是有很多人失败了 但并非所有人
Maybe it was the case that many failed,but not everyone.
有些人成功了 而且非常成功
Some succeeded and succeeded big time.
心理学家们此时便开始问 为什么
And what psychologists started to do then was to ask why.
为什么他们如此成功?
What is it about them that is so successful?
用Frost的话来说 这才是至关重要的
And that,in the words of Frost,made all the difference.
心理学家们开始识别这些人的各种因素
The psychologists started to identify elements,
以及各个方面并深入分析他们
aspects of these individuals and studied them in depth,
他们开始研究这些成功的人
starting to study the successful individuals,
并识别出各种因素
and identify elements that they could then teach later
然后他们通过研究想出介入方法
in creating interventions based on what they had studied.
突然间结果出来了 真正的结果
And suddenly,there were results,real results,
切实的结果 打破了数十年零结果的局面
tangible results,after decades of virtually zero results,
这仅仅是基于一个简单的问题
simply based on the question.
那时候出现的主要概念
And the main concept that came out at that time,
通过这些心理学家的研究
through the research of these psychologists
正是他们开始问积极的问题
who started to ask the positive question,
开始专注于研究成功的孩子们
started to focus on what is working on the successful children.
那时出现的概念是心理弹性
The concept that came out was the concept of resilience.
现在大家都在谈心理弹性
Now today everyone talks about resilience.
我们在学校谈心理弹性
We talk about resilience in school,
在工作上谈 在卧室里谈
at work,in the job,in the bedroom.
在哪里都谈心理弹性
Everywhere resilience.
然而 在20世纪80年代
However,at that time in the 1980s,
很少人谈及甚至很少人知道它的意思
very few people even talked about or knew what that means.
研究心理弹性的时候 它被定义如下
When they studied resilience,which is defined as following,
它的定义关系重大
it made all the difference.
心理弹性
Resilience,--
一种现象 特征是积极适应的模式
a class of phenomena characterized by patterns of positive
即使是面对非常不利或危险的环境
adaptation in the context of significant adversity or risk.
这些成功的孩子最终成功了
These kids,who succeeded-- ended up succeeding,
这是通过纵向研究得出的结论
and they look through longitudinal studies--
五年后 十年后 三十年后
5 years later,10 years,30 years later,
这些成功的孩子都具有适应力
the kids who succeeded,were resilient.
一开始 当他们研究这些孩子时
Initially,when they studied these kids,
他们认为这些孩子一定很优秀
the assumption was these must be super kids,extraordinary kids,
百里挑一甚至千里挑一
one in a hundred,one in a thousand-
因此是不可以模仿的
not really replicable,therefore.
然而
However,
当他们继续研究
what they found when they continued to study
这些成功的人时 继续研究虽然环境不理想
those people who work,those people who succeeded,
然而仍然成功的人时
despite the unfavorable circumstances,
他们发现这些并非是非常优秀的孩子
-- what they found was these were not super kids.
实际上这些是普通的孩子 他们性格普通
In fact these were ordinary kids with ordinary characteristics
但是成就非凡
that led to extraordinary results.
例如 我告诉你们几件事
For example,let me share with you some of the things.
这些孩子都很乐观
These kids were optimistic,
不是那种不切实际的盲目乐观
-- not optimistic in the detached Pollyannish sense,
而是乐观地相信
-- optimistic in that they believe in things
事情会被圆满地解决
that would work out well,
我们会经常把乐观主义当作诠释谈及
and we'll talk a lot about optimism as an interpretation style,
也就是Martin Seligman和karen Reivich的乐观主义
in the work of Martin Seligman and karen Reivich.
他们的乐观在于认为
They were optimistic in the sense of thinking,
"好吧 也许这次不会成功"
"well,it may not work well this time.
"它以后会成功的"
It will work out later.
"我从刚发生的事学到了东西"
I have learned from what had just happened."
他们对生活有信心 认为它有意义
They had faith and sense of meaning in life.
有时它是宗教信仰 但却不总是这样
Sometimes it was religious faith,not always.
这种信仰是做他们相信的事
It was doing something that they really believed in.
他们中很多人都是理想主义者
Many of them were idealistic.
我们在这门课程里谈及的话题之一
One of main topics we will discuss in this class is
就是理想主义就是现实主义
that to be idealistic is to be realistic,
因为我们的内心需要理想主义
because we have a real internal need,innate need for idealism.
所以这些孩子有"意义感"
So these kids experienced sense of meaning,
不管是个人成功方面的意义
whether it was meaning in terms of personal success
以及他们的行事方式的意义
and how I will make it,
或者是服务社区的意义
or sense of meaning in their community contributing,
还有事情的目标意义
something meaningful in sense of purpose.
顺便说一下 我说的这一切
By the way,when I go through all these,
它们对所有人都一样重要
these are no less important for any other person in the world.
我们之前提到的心理弹性
This resilience as we mentioned earlier
不但对受危人群很重要
is just not important for the at-risk population.
对哈佛大学里的人也一样重要
It's as important at Harvard.
也不仅是在考试期间重要
And not just during exam period.
把心理弹性与幸福联系起来非常重要
It's important that resilience is associated with wellbeing.
思考这些特点 你就会展示它们
So think about these characteristics and you display them.
我在这里提到的这些特点
And the interesting thing about all these characteristics
你可以学到它们
they can all be learned.
有趣的一点就是它们都可以习得
that I'll mention here is that they can all be taught;
从多个方面来说 这门课程说的就是这个
In many ways,this class is about that.
当心理学家们识别出这些特点之后
And when the psychologists identified these,
他们开始教授它们 人们也开始学了
they started to teach them and the individuals started to learn
情况便发生了变化
and that made all the difference.
除了信心以及"意义感"
In addition to the faith and sense of meaning,
利社会行为 帮助他人
pro-social behavior,helping other people,
从无助转变到有益 它们都非常重要
shifting from helplessness to helpfulness,they were significant.
我们要讨论的事情之一就是
One of the things that we'll talk about is
帮助他人的意义
how meaningful it is to help other people.
它不但帮助他人
And how much it doesn't just only help others,
它还会帮助我们自己
it also helps ourselves.
我们便进入了自助和助他人的上升式螺旋里
And we enter an upward spiral between self-help and other-help.
因为我们帮助他人时也在帮助自己
Because when we help others,we are helping ourselves.
当我们帮助自己时在帮助他人
when we help ourselves,we help others.
循环往复
And so on and so on.
所以他们都是利社会者
So they were pro-social.
他们都在帮助别人
They were helping other people.
他们的眼光集中在自己的长处上
They focused on their strength
而不是缺点
rather than primarily deficiencies.
他们不忽视自己的缺点 但他们会问
They did not ignore their weaknesses,but they asked,
我真正擅长的是什么?
"what am I good at? What am I really,really good at?"
重申一次 这门课程的目标之一
And again,part of this course,
就是你会认清自己的长处
you'll identify your strength,
不管是通过线上测试
whether it's through online test,
通过回应报告
whether it's through reflection papers,
通过小组学习
whether it's in section.
还是通过阅读 你都会思考它
You'll think about it whether it's through your readings.
认清长处
Identify the strength.
他们擅长的是什么?
What are they good at?
他们为自己设立目标
They set goals for themselves.
他们面向未来
They were future-oriented,
他们不但思考事情现在有多糟糕
not just thinking about how bad things are today perhaps,
同时也在思考
but also thinking about
五年后或十年后的目标
"this is where I wanna be 5 years or 10 years from now."
607
我们会用三节课谈论设立目标
We are going to devote three classes to goal setting,
这是心理弹性的重要组成部分
very significant part of resilience.
他们有一个榜样
They had a role model.
他们会说
Someone who they said about
"我想像她那样 我想像他那样"
"I want to be like her; I want to be like him."
榜样可以是老师 可以是亲戚朋友
It could be a teacher. It could be a parent,sibling,friend.
有时候
Sometimes,
它是一个历史人物或小说的人物
it was a historical figure or a fictional character,
一个他们可以效仿的人
someone that they want to emulate,to be like.
榜样给予他们力量 给他们方向感
That gave them strength. That gave them sense of direction.
最后 最重要的就是他们不单干
And finally,most significantly,they did not bowl alone.
他们有社会的支持 他们不会说
They had social support. They did not say :
"我够能干 可以自己做"
"well I am tough enough to do it by myself."
他们说"我够能干 我可以请求帮助"
Rather they said :"I'm tough enough to reach out for help."
因为那确实需要某种能力
Because that does require certain toughness.
还有承认弱点的勇气
The strength to admit weaknesses as well,
承认有某种需要的勇气
the strength to admit a need.
想想
Now think about these:
你在哈佛 在生活中你有这些东西吗?
do you have these things here for yourself at Harvard in life?
如果没有 你可以培养这一切
And if not,you can cultivate all of these things,
不管是社会支持...
whether it's a social support--
不用是每天
and it doesn't have to be a hundred people
与你交谈的一百人
whom you talk to everyday;
它可以是一两个好朋友 父母 室友
it can be one or two close friends,mom,dad,roommates--
这至关重要
makes a big difference.
它是心理弹性最重要的因素
No. 1 contributor to resilience.
社会支持重要的一点
Now the important thing about social support
就是找到适合的人
is identifying the right people.
那些你向他们请求帮助
People who,when you reach out to them,
便会给予回应的人
will reach back to you and will be able to give back.
现在我向你们展示一个并不太好的榜样
I want to show you an example now of a not so good role model
不太好的社会支持
for social support.
这是Grace和Karen之间的一段交流
And that is an interaction
视频片断来自剧集《Will and Grace》
between Grace and Karen from Will and Grace.
《Will and Grace》（第3季第9集）
Will and Grace (From Episode 309):
这台游戏机是份不错的生日礼物
SALESMAN: This video game makes a nice birthday gift.
你觉得你的继子会喜欢吗?
Do you think your stepson would like that?
我不知道 亲爱的
KAREN: I don't know,honey.
他可以吃它或者摩擦它吗?
Can he eat it or rub up against it?
我们换一种方式了解
SALESMAN: Let's come at this a different way.
他的兴趣是什么?
What are his interests?
火腿
KAREN: Ham.
还是你自己到处看看吧
SALESMAN: Why don't I just let you browse awhile?
好的 谢谢
KAREN: Yeah. Thanks. Ooh,and,uh,
你可以处理一下
do you think there's anything you could do
这些小孩吗?
about all these kids in here?
夫人 这是玩具店
SALESMAN: Ma'am,it's a toy store.
好的 处理一下
KAREN: Yeah. See what you can do.
别挡道 矮个子
Move it,shorty.
Karen
GRACE: Hi,Karen. Um...
今天我不能和你买东西了 我得走了
I can't help you shop today. I've gotta go.
怎么回事?发生什么事了?
KAREN: What's going on? What's happening?
为什么要装害羞?
What's with the geisha hand?
没什么
GRACE: Nothing.
我在皮肤科医生那里做了点手术
I just had something zapped at the dermatologist's,
看起来有点恐怖
and it looks kinda funky,
现在我不想任何人看到它
and I just don't want anyone to see it right now.
Grace
KAREN: Grace,
我敢说它并没有你想的那么糟糕
I'm sure it's not nearly as bad as you think it is.
也许不值一提 一个小点 让妈妈看看
It's probably nothing,a little dot. Come on. Show mama.
啊 我的天啊
KAREN: Aah! Whoa! Oh! Oh,my God! Oh!
嘘 Karen 冷静下来
GRACE: Shh! Shhhhh! Karen,Will you calm down?
你叫我怎么冷静下来?
KAREN: How do you expect me to calm down
我看到它的心脏在我面前跳动
when I can see its heart beating right in front of me?! Aah!
嘘
GRACE: Shh!
好的
KAREN: Well,uh,alright.
好的 非常抱歉
Alright,I'm sorry.
你患疱疹多久了？
So how long have you had the herpes?
这不是疱疹
GRACE: It's not herpes.
它跟疱疹挨不着边
It's not even herpes adjacent.
是吗?
KAREN: Oh,yeah? Well,
它可以参加疱疹的家庭野餐了
it's close enough to be invited to the herpes family picnic.
这是一个奇怪的雀斑
GRACE: It was a weird freckle,
医生想要冻结它
and the doctor wanted to freeze it,
然后他告诉我要十天才能复原
and then he told me that it was going to take 10 days to heal.
他怎么会认为我可以丑陋十天?
I mean,what made him assume that I could look awful for 10 days?
因此 我要拿着你的尼龙包擦它
Respond to that,and I will rub it all over your Prada.
你在看什么 大肚婆?
KAREN: What are you lookin' at,prego?
以前没见过疱疹吗?
Haven't you ever seen herpes before?
天啊 胖子真是麻木不仁
Jeez. Fat people are so insensitive
我的天啊 我的天啊
GRACE: Oh,my God. Oh,my God.
从这块小玩具镜照出来的样子看来
Would you look at it in this little toy mirror?
它变大了 就像芭比梦想中的青春痘
It's gotten...bigger. It's like Barbie's dream zit.
幸亏我取消了和Mark的约会
Thank God I canceled my date with Mark.
没错 因为它看起来
KAREN: Yeah,'cause that thing looks like
要交通柱和警察拦护带才能遮住
it needs orange cones and police tape around it.
来吧 我们离开这里
GRACE: Come on. Let's get outta here.
Karen也许不是社会支持的好选择
So Karen may not be a good choice for social support.
但是有很多人却是好的选择
But there are many people who are.
想想一个问题的力量
Now think about the power of the question.
想想一个问题带来的结果
Think about what a question did.
数十年间
For decades,
很多可以得到帮助的人没有得到
many kids who potentially could have been helped weren't helped,
因为没有提出正确的问题
because the right question was not asked as well.
只有在积极问题...
And it was only after positive question,
专注于积极的问题被提出来后
the focusing on the positive question was asked
心理学家们突然能够看到
that suddenly psychologists were able to see
数十年来一直都在眼前的东西
what was right in front of them for decades.
它就在那里 显而易见 等待着被发现
It was right there,apparent evident,waiting to be discovered,
但是他们完全忽略了
but they completely missed it.
他们聪明 动机良好 资金充足
Smart,well-intentioned,well-funded,
但是仍然没有提出正确的问题
but also didn't ask the right question.
问题制造现实 它们制造可能性
Questions create reality. They create possibilities.
一个问题引起一场探索
A question begins a quest.
他们在积极心理学方面的成就...
What they did in positive psychology again,
其中很大部分都是通过Antonovsky的努力
a great deal through the work of Antonovsky was move us
就是让我们从致病模型转到有益健康模型
from the pathogenic model to the salutogenic model.
健康本源学 健康的基础 起源
Salutogenesis,the foundation,the origin of health.
据Antonovsky所说
And Antonovsky was talking about,
研究疾病很重要
he said that it's important to study illness,
不管是精神疾病还是身体疾病
mental illness,physical illness,
但是研究健康的人也同样重要
but it's equally important to study the healthy people,
看看他们为什么会如此健康
the healthy individuals to see how they make it,
不管是否是哈佛大学里的人
whether it's people at Harvard.
哈佛大学是一个压力非常大的环境
Harvard is a stressful environment.
但是有些人却能走完它
However,there are some people who are able to go through it,
表现优秀 茁壮成长
to do well,to thrive,flourish and--
他们也经历起起伏伏
well still going through the ups and downs,
我们都是这样 但是总体上
we all do-- overall experience it
他们的经历更积极更快乐
as a much more positive experience as a happy experience overall.
他们是如何做到的?为什么?
How do they do that? Why?
Antonovsky说我们要研究这点
Antonovsky said we need to study that
这样我们就能了解健康的本源
so that we understand the origin of health.
他研究了这些东西
And he studied these things
而且它在该领域产生了很大影响
and it made a big difference in the field as a whole.
Antonovsky说"那些熟悉科学史的人"
Quote Antonovsky: "All those familiar with the history of science
"都知道重要的进步"
are aware thatimportant advances come
"伴随着新问题的形成而来"
with the formulation of the new questions.
"问题才是突破点"
The question is the breakthrough;
"答案来之不易"
the answer comes with difficulty,
"但重要的是新问题"
but it is the new question that is important.
"有益健康问题"
The salutogenic question,
"也就是我向你传播的"(正在发生)
I submit to you,(that is what is working)
"是一个极为新颖的问题"
is a radically new question,
"它推动新范式的形成"
which provides the impetus for formulating a new paradigm
"以帮助我们了解健康和疾病"
to help us understand health and illness.
"它对研究人员和医生有着重要意义"
It has serious implications for researcher and clinician,
"生物学家和社会科学家也是如此"
biological and social scientist alike."
正是那个问题缔造了
It was that question that essentially created the field of
积极心理学和积极社会学
positive psychology as well as positive sociology.
他是训练有素的社会学家和其他领域的专家
He was a sociologist by training as well as many other fields.
问题导致改变
Questions make a difference.
问题缔造现实
Questions create reality.
现在我想和你们做一个练习
I want to do an exercise with you now.
我们在课堂上会做一些练习
We'll do quite a few exercises in class.
这是第一个
Here's the first one.
为了阐明问题的重要性
To illustrate the importance of question,
我要让你数几何图形的个数
now I'm going to ask you to count the number of geometric shapes
你在屏幕上看到多少个...
that you see on the screen--
不 不是这个屏幕
no,not this screen,
是下一个屏幕
the next screen.
你们是哈佛大学的学生 没问题的
And you are Harvard students. It's fine.
下一个屏幕
The next screen,
我要让你们数几何图形的个数
I am going to ask you to count the number of geometric shapes
你在屏幕上看到的 这是个非常难的问题
that you see on the screen. It's a very difficult question.
我把它给世界各地的人看过
I've given it to people around the world.
我让数学家和视觉艺术家看过
I've given it to mathematicians,to artists who are very visual.
这里的挑战是
And the challenge here is you are only going to
你只有30秒去看它
have 30 seconds in which to do it,
30秒之后告诉我你在屏幕上你看到了
30 seconds to tell me how many geometric shapes
多少个几何图形
you see on the screen.
准备好了吗?30秒
Ready? 30 seconds.
你看到屏幕上有多少个几何图形?
How many geometric shapes do you see on the screen?
开始
Go.
好的 31秒过去了
Ok. So that's 31 seconds.
应该没有问题了
So there should be no problem.
如果你没有做过...
Now if you haven't done-
我知道你们有些人做过这个练习
I know a couple of you have done this exercise before,
但是如果你以前没做过这个练习
but if you haven't done- this exercise before,
应该是大多数人
-- and that's most of you,
我希望你们能参与其中
I'd like you to participate.
你数出了屏幕上的多少个图形?
So how many geometric shapes could you count on the screen?
把数字说出来
Throw out the numbers.
6 8 48 58 44 36 110 
6. 8. 48. 58. 44. 36. 110. 38.
多少?
How many?
上面呢?
Up there?
你们的视角很好
You have a good perspective.
8 有多于110个的吗?
8. Anyone more than 110?
好的 多少?300?
Yeah,how many? 300?
200 有多于200个或少于6个的吗?
200. Anyone more than 200 or less than 6?
好的 很大的范围
Ok. So quite a range.
但是我承认这是个很难的问题
But I grant you that it's a tough question.
顺便说一下 如果你下载的PPT上
By the way if you have it on your power points
有这幅图...
that you downloaded,
后来我取消下载了
I took it off on the later downloading,
但是如果你下载了它
but if you downloaded it,
请现在不要看
don't look at it now please.
数到的个数在6个到200个之间
So we have the rate between 6 and 200.
这是一个很难的问题
Now it's a tough question.
实际上
In fact,
它难到我根本不知道有多少个几何图形
it is so tough that I have no idea how many geometric shapes
在屏幕上
there are on the screen.
但是我有另一个问题要问你们
But I have another question for you.
如果你知道这个问题的答案
Now if you know the answer to this question,
就把手举起来
just put your hand up
如果你以前没做过这个练习
--and if you haven't done this exercise before,
就把手举起来 别说出来
-- just put your hand up. Don't shout it out.
如果你知道答案 把手举起来
If you know the answer,put your hand up:
时钟上显示的是几点钟?
what time was it on the clock?
如果你知道答案就把手举起来
If you know the answer,put your hand up.
如果你认为你知道答案 举一半
If you think you know the answer,half way up.
也许知道 举四分之一
Maybe maybe,quarter.
剩下的可以离开了
And the rest of you may leave now.
有几个举了一半 所以在整个教室里
Ok,so we have a few halves. So out of the room,
这里有多少...这里大概有六七百个学生
--how many were there-- probably 600,700 students here,
在七百个哈佛学生里
out of 700 Harvard students,
五个半人能看到时钟上的时间
five and a half people can read the time on the clock.
但是我知道 我们今天都有电子表
But I understand,we all have digital watches today.
这很困难
It's difficult.
我来问你们另一个较容易的问题
So let me ask you an easier question.
如果你知道答案就把手举起来
If you know the answer,just put your hand up.
没错
That's right!
你看到巴士上有多少个小孩?
How many kids were visible on the bus?
如果你知道答案 把手举起来
If you know the answer,put your hand up.
如果你觉得你知道 举一半
If you think you know,half way up.
也许知道 举四分之一
Maybe,quarter.
大多数人都在想"什么巴士?"
Yeah,most of you think,"what bus?!"
"什么小孩?"
You know. "What kids?"
就在那里
Well it was there.
整个教室里的七百个哈佛学生
So out of a room of --again -- 700 Harvard students,
大概有11.75人数出来了
there are approximately 11 and 3/4. Who can count?
但那没关系
But that's Ok.
这不是55号数学课程
That's not my 55 (Math 55 course in Harvard) here.
我明白
I understand.
另一个问题
Another question.
它比较容易
A little bit easier.
屏幕上最左边的几何图形
What was the color of,the dominant color of
它的主要颜色是什么?
the left-most geometric shape on the screen?
不是较大的那个图形
Not the big one on screen,
而是屏幕上最左边的几何图形
but the left-most geometric shape on the screen.
主要颜色是什么?
What was the dominant color?
如果你知道答案 把手举起来
If you know the answer,hand right up.
如果觉得自己知道 举一半
If you think you know,half way.
好的 大概是12.25人
Ok. So that's about 12 1/4 people.
根据我的估计研究
According to my estimated research,
这个教室里大概有五到七人
there are probably between 5 and 7 people in this room
是色盲的
who are color blind.
真的 根据统计资料
Really-- according to the statistics.
其余的人则没有借口说看不清
The rest of you have no excuse.
我们来看看
Let's look.
时钟上显示的时间?
So the time on the clock?
有谁觉得很难看清时间吗?
Someone difficult to obscure the time?
十点十分
10:10.
这是有点难
Well it's a bit difficult.
可以看见车上有多少个小孩?
Visible children on the bus?
汽车在这里 有些人还是看不见
Here's the bus,for those of you still can't see it.
五个 还有颜色
5. And the color.
最左边几何图形的主要颜色?
The dominant color of the geometric shape?
855
黄色
Yellow.
怎么回事?
What happened?
这是说 这些并不是非常难的问题
I mean these are not very difficult questions.
就算是积极心理学的期末考
Even the final of positive psychology
都要比它难
is going to be difficult than that.
真的 难很多
I mean,really. A lot more.
为什么?
Why?
862
原因是 我问了你们某个特定的问题
Well the reason is I asked you a certain question,
那个问题让你注意现实的某一部分
and that question directed you to a certain part of reality.
00:47:46,350 --&gt; 00:47:47,240
这是件好事
And that's a good thing.
因为如果我们总是专注于一切事情
Because if we were focusing on everything all the time,
那就不是件好事
that wouldn't be a good thing.
每种噪音都会让我们分心
We would be distracted by every single noise,
所有物体运动都会让我们分心
by every single movement.
所以我们能集中注意力是件好事
So it's a good thing that we can focus.
但是 我们也要记得
However,we also need to remember
这种集中精神的能力带来的后果
the consequences of this ability to focus
却不总是好事或者有益的
that is not always good it's not always helpful.
因为在你们看来
Because as far as you were concerned,
巴士上没有小孩
there were no children on the bus.
在你们看来
As far as you were concerned,
上面只有几何图形
there were only geometric shapes.
换句话说 我的问题给你们大多数人
In other words,my question,for most of you,
制造了一种特定的现实
created a very specific reality,
一种只有几何图形
a reality which there were geometric shapes
巴士上没有小孩的现实
and no children on the bus.
这有着非常重要的含义
Now that has very important implications.
想想以下的问题 蜜月期过后
Think about the following question: what question is mostly asked
夫妻间问的最多的问题是什么?
by couples beyond the honeymoon phase?
他们度过蜜月期之后
so they go through the honeymoon phase
不管是一个月 一年还是两年
whether it's a month,a year or sometimes two years.
那段时期后他们会开始问什么问题?
What questions do they begin to ask after that period of time?
"怎么回事?有什么问题?"
"What's wrong? What's not working?
"我们怎样去改善关系?'
How can we improve the relationship?"
这是一个非常重要的问题
Now that's a very important question to ask.
非常重要
Very important.
但如果这是我们所问的
But if that's the only question
唯一一些问题
or the only questions that we ask,
那么我们看到的也只有这件事
then that is the only thing we will see.
我们能看到的只是我们的不足
The only things that we will see are our deficiencies,
出了差错的事情
the things that are not working,
需要去改善的事情
the things that need to be improved,
我伴侣的缺点
the weaknesses of my partner,
我们关系的缺点
of the relationship.
如果我只是问"什么出了差错"
If the only questions that I ask are "what is not working",
"怎么回事 我要改善什么" 重申一次
"what's wrong","what do I need to improve"-- and again,
我们不需要去掉这些问题
these are not questions we need to do away with,
它们很重要 但如果它们是唯一的问题
they are important. However if they are the only questions,
而通常它们确实是
and usually they are the only questions
被提出或主要提出的问题
that are asked or primarily asked,
那么在这对夫妇看来 不是客观上
then as far as the couple is concerned,not objectively,
在这对夫妇看来
but as far as the couple is concerned,
他们的关系里没有好的事物
good things do not exist in the relationship.
就像在你们看来
Just like as far as you are concerned,
巴士上没有小孩
there were no children on the bus,
虽然他们就在你们面前
even though they were right there in front of you,
盯着你
staring at you.
但是他们不存在
But they do not exist.
或者从个人的角度思考它
Or think about it at an individual level.
这非常重要
This is very important.
我们问得最多的问题...
What is the question that we,
大多数美国人 澳大利亚人 中国人
most Americans,most Australians,most Chinese,
以色列人 欧洲人 非洲人
most Israelis,most Europeans,Africans--
大多数人最经常问自己的是什么问题?
what is the question that is mostly asked about the self?
我之所以要提到那些地方
And the reason why I mentioned all these places
是因为这是跨文化的研究
is because this is cross-cultural study.
大多数人都会问自己
People mostly ask themselves,
我的弱点是什么?我要改善什么?
"what are my weaknesses? What do I need to improve?"
通常排除了
Very often to the exclusion of
我的长处是什么?我擅长于什么?
"what are my strengths? What are my virtues? What am I good at?"
如果我们问自己的
And if the only question
唯一问题是
that we ask ourselves are the only questions that are
我的缺点 我的不足是什么?
"what are my weaknesses? Deficiencies?",
那么我们能看到的
then the only thing we'll see in ourselves
只有自己的缺点和不足
are weaknesses and deficiencies.
在我们看来
And as far as we are concerned,
好的东西 我们的长处 热情 美德
the good things-- our strengths,our passions,our virtues--
我们身上的美好事物并不存在
the wonderful things within us do not exist.
就像在你们看来
Just like as far as you are concerned,
巴士上的小孩并不存在
the children on the bus did not exist.
现在我问你们
Now I ask you,
一个主要关注缺点的人
could a person who only or primarily focuses on weaknesses
看不到
and does not see,
也不欣赏他们的长处 热情
does not appreciate their strength,their passions,
他们的美德的人
their virtues--
一个这样的人会有很高的自尊心
can a person like that experience high levels of self-respect,
自信心和很多的快乐吗?
self-confidence,happiness?
我们还奇怪 为什么这么多婚姻会失败?
And we wonder,why do so many relationships fail?
我们还奇怪 为什么抑郁 焦虑
And we wonder,why depression,anxiety
以及自尊心低落的情况增加了这么多?
and low self-esteem are increasing so much?
00:51:52,430 --&gt; 00:51:53,990
动机是有的
The intentions are there.
它们都是好的动机 我们问的是
They are good. We are asking
"我们如何改善?怎样才能做得更好?"
"How can we improve? What can we do better?"
但如果我们不问积极的问题
But if we don't also ask the positive question,
在我们看来那部分现实并不存在
that part of reality will not exist as far as we are concerned.
就像数十年来对那些心理学家一样
Just like for the psychologists for decade,
他们问题的答案 问题的解决方案
the answer to their questions,the solution to the problem
并不存在
that they wanted to solve did not exist,
即使它就在那里
even though it is right there,
在他们的眼前 在那些成功孩子的身上
in front of their very eyes within the successful kids,
在他们的心理弹性里
within their resilience.
问题缔造现实
Questions create reality.
我们所问的问题通常决定了
The questions we ask very often determine
我们追求的东西
the quest that we will pursue,
我们会走的道路
the path that we will take,
我们会过的生活
the life that we will lead,
不管是从个人方面来说
whether it's individually,
从人际关系方面来说
whether it's interpersonally,
从组织方面来说都是这样
whether it's organizationally.
什么问题...
What is the question?
我知道你们很多会要当心理辅导师
Many of you I know are going into consulting.
心理辅导师最经常问的问题是什么?
What's the question that most consultants ask,
不管他们是否说出来
Either explicit question or implicit question,
他们首次见到客户问的问题是什么?
the first time when they meet a client?
"有什么问题?有什么需要改善的?"
--"What's wrong? What can we improve?
"有什么缺点需要改正?"
What are the weaknesses that we need to strengthen them?"
再说一次 它们是很重要的问题
Again,important questions to ask.
但如果你只问这些问题
But if you only ask these questions,
那么你就忽视了这个机构的
then you are ignoring the strengths,
优势以及美德
the virtues of the organization.
你所做的只是在让他们失去活力
And what you are doing,you are enervating,
你在让公司慢慢地变弱
you are weakening the organization over time.
欣赏起作用的东西
It is as important,if not more important,
也同样重要 如果不是更重要的话
to also appreciate what is working,
不管是在机构里 人际关系里或个人方面
organizationally,interpersonally,as well as individually.
欣赏好的事物非常重要
It is important to appreciate what is good.
看看"Appreciate"这个词
I mean,look at the word,"appreciate".
它有两个意思 其一就是为某事感激
Two meanings: first meaning-- to say thank you for something,
而不是认为某事理所当然
not to take it for granted.
这样做很好
And that's a nice thing to do.
我们不应该把长处 成功看作理所当然
We shouldn't take for granted our virtues,our successes.
我们不应把别人看作理所当然
We shouldn't take for granted others.
这是很好的事情
That's a nice thing to do.
但是"Appreciate"还有一个意思就是增值
But appreciate has a second meaning,which is to grow.
钱在银行里会增值
Money appreciates in the bank.
经济会增长
The economy hopefully appreciates.
当我们感激好的东西
When we appreciate the good,
好的东西便会增值 它会增长
the good appreciates-- the good grows.
不幸的是 反过来也是成立的
Unfortunately,the other side of the same coin applies as well.
当我们不感激好的东西
When we don't appreciate the good,
把它看作理所当然 好的东西会贬值
when we take it for granted,the good depreciates.
那就是大多数婚姻
And that's what happens in most relationships
蜜月期后发生的情况
after the honeymoon phase.
那就是发生在多数人身上的情况
That's what happens to most people,
特别是对于那些有动力去提高
especially to very driven people who want to improve,
想变得更好的人
who want to get better.
那是件好事
And that's good thing,
如果那让你感到开心的话
if that is what makes you happy.
同时
At the same time,
欣赏自己的优点也同样重要
it's equally important to also appreciate what is good inside me
我的长处 优点是什么
what my strengths,what my virtues are.
我们在课堂中将经常练习这点
And we are going to do a lot of that in the course.
但是不会做到自我陶醉的程度
And again,not to go to the point of narcissism.
我们会谈到自我陶醉
If anything narcissism-- and we'll talk about it
就在本学期倒数第二节课
in the second last lecture in the semester-
自我陶醉不是自信 不是自尊
narcissism is not about self-confidence,about self-esteem.
它正好相反
It's exactly the opposite.
我们说的是有根据的自信
We are talking about grounded self-confidence.
有根据的大方有益的快乐
Grounded,generous,benevolent happiness.
为了过上那种生活
In order to lead that kind of life,
我们还要欣赏起作用的东西
we need to also appreciate what is working,
用比喻的意义上说 还要留意巴士上的小孩
to also focus on,metaphorically speaking,the children on a bus.
Stavros和Torres在一本关于婚姻的好书里说
Stavros and Torres in the wonderful book on relationships,
"我们会看到要寻找的东西"
"We see what we look for and we miss much of
"错失不去寻找的东西 虽然它在那里"
what we are not looking for even though it is there.
"我们的阅历"
Our experience of the world is heavily influenced
"被我们的关注点深深地影响了"
by where we place our attention."
问题经常会缔造现实
Questions very often create reality.
理解什么是问题的首要事情
The first important thing to understand about questions
就是我们要理解那些问题
is that we need to understand the questions.
在这点我同意一位重要哲学家
And here I want to defer to a very important philosopher,
一位20世纪和21世纪的哲学家
a 20th and 21st century philosopher,
他阐明了理解问题的重要性
who illustrates the importance of understanding questions--
荷马辛普森
Homer Simpson.
能不能把声音调低一点
If you can just turn down the voice,the sound a little bit,
因为它非常大声 谢谢
because this is very loud. Thank you.
辛普森一家
The Simpsons
现在我们要做几项测试
SCULLY: Now we're gonna run a few tests.
这是一台简单的测谎仪
This is a simple lie detector.
我会问你几个问题 你回答是或否
I'll ask you a few yes or no questions
你要老实回答
and you just answer truthfully.
明白吗?
Do you understand?
明白
HOMER: Yes.
很精彩
Love it. Love it.
所以第一步是真正理解问题
So the first step is really understanding the question.
但是我们理解问题之后
But once we understand it,
知道我们要问什么问题也很重要
it is also important to know what questions are we going to ask.
我之前提到过培养心理弹性的要事之一
I mentioned earlier that one of the most important things
就是要有一个榜样
in cultivating resilience is having a role model.
现在我要告诉你们我的榜样
I want to share with you now my role model,
实际上 正是因为她
in fact,the person who is the reason
我才决定成为一名教师
why I decided to become a teacher.
她叫Marva Collins
Her name is Marva Collins.
Marva Collins20世纪30年代生于阿拉巴马州
Marva Collins was born in Alabama in the 1930s.
她父亲是非洲裔美国人 母亲是印地安人
Her father was African American; her mother,Native American.
她出生的时候
she was born at a time in a place
种族岐视风行
where there was a great deal of discrimination.
幸运的是 对于Marva
Fortunately,for Marva,
她父亲对她非常有信心
her father really believed in her
从小他就对她说
and said to her from a very young age,
"Marva 你将会有所作为"
"Marva,you can make something of your life.
"你可以成为一名秘书"
You can become a secretary."
他之说以说秘书是因为
Now the reason why he said secretary is because
那就是无形的障碍
that was where the glass ceiling,
或者说是有形的障碍
or rather concrete ceiling exists
鉴于她的种族背景
for a person of her ethnic background,
鉴于她的性别
a person of her gender.
Marva Collins努力工作
Marva Collins worked hard.
她很聪明 她成功了
She was smart. She succeeded. She made it.
她成为了一名秘书
And she became a secretary.
做了几年秘书之后 虽然干得不错
After a few years of working as a secretary,doing well,
她觉得这不适合她 不是她的使命
she decided this was not for her and what her calling in life.
她真正的热情在于教书
Her real passion was in teaching.
她想成为学校里的一名教师
She wanted to be a school teacher.
于是她上夜校
She went to night school.
几年之后
A few years later,
她得到了教师证书
she got her teaching certificate,
她结婚了并和丈夫搬到了芝加哥
got married and with her husband moved to Chicago.
她在那加入了芝加哥内城的公立学校
There she joined the public school system in inner city,Chicago.
她在那里看到的现实
The reality that she found,
是大量犯罪
that she encountered there was a reality of much crime,
毒品泛滥 最重要的是没有希望
much drugs and more than anything,hopelessness.
老师们的希望是让孩子们
The hope of the teachers was to keep the students in school
在学校里尽可能呆久点
for as long as possible.
为什么?因为这样他们就不会12岁加入街头帮派
Why? --So that they don't join the street gangs at the age of 12;
这样他们就不会接触毒品 不会犯罪
so that they are protected from the drugs,from crime.
"我们怎样让学生呆在学校里?"
"How can we keep the students in school for as long as possible?"
老师们问
asked the teachers.
Marva Collins面对这种现实说
Marva Collins walks into this reality and says,
"事情将有所改观"
"Things are going to be different."
在上课的第一天...
On the first day of class,
她教一年级到四年级
-- she teaches first graders to fourth graders--
在上课的第一天
--on the first day of class,
她对学生们说
she says to her students,
"我们要练习自信"
"We are going to do a lot of believing in ourselves."
她不断地重复地说着这则信息
And she repeats this message over and over and over again,
整个学期犹如不断重播的唱片
like a broken record throughout the semester
最后坚持了整年 几年
and the year and years.
"我相信你 你能做好 你能成功"
"I believe in you. You can do well. You can succeed.
"承担生活的责任"
Take responsibility for your life.
"停止抱怨 停止抱怨政府"
Stop blaming. Stop blaming the government.
"停止抱怨老师 停止抱怨父母"
Stop blaming your teachers. Stop blaming your parents.
"成功与否全在你自己"
It is up to you to succeed."
00:59:59,100 --&gt; 01:00:03,
她继续不断地重复着这则信息
And she continues with this message over and over and over again.
她对学生们充满期望
Having really high expectations of her students,
把眼光放在他们的长处
looking at what they are good at,
和优点上 并而加以培养
their strength and cultivating those.
奇迹开始发生了
Miracles begin to happen. These students,
这些被老师认为是"不可教"的学生
considered by many of the teachers to be"unteachable"-
到了四年级便可以读
these "unteachable" ones by the time that they are in
欧里庇得斯 爱默生和莎翁的作品
fourth grade are reading Euripides,Emerson and Shakespeare.
这些"不可教"的学生在十岁时
These "unteachable" ones at the age of 
便可以做高中的数学
are doing high school mathematics.
关于Marva Collins的谣言开始传播
Now rumor begins to spread about Marva Collins,
她怎能让这些学生在教室里呆这么长时间
because how can she keep these students in class for so long,
而其他学生却想着离开学校?
when all the other students are just trying to get out of school?
她一定是在强迫他们
She must be using force.
Marva Collins受够了谣言的中伤
And Marva Collins has enough of these rumors,
她离开公共学校成立了自己的学校
leave the public school system,opens up her own school
就在她的厨房里 开始只有四个学生
in her own kitchen with 4 students and initially,
其中两个是她的孩子
two of them her own kids.
逐渐地 越来越多的学生进入了Marva Collins学校
Gradually,more and more students join the Marva Collins school,
她称之为西岸小学
Westside preparatory she calls it.
一开始进入这间学校的学生
All the students that initially joined the school
都是从公共学校退学的
are public school dropouts.
Marva Collins是他们成为街头混混前最后的希望
Marva Collins is the last resort before the street.
奇迹继续发生
And the miracles continue.
逐渐地 越来越多的学生进入
Gradually more and more students come in.
她不得不搬出去
She has to move out of her home.
他们在芝加哥租了一间小室
They wretchedly rent a small shack in Chicago place,
冬天寒冷无比 夏天酷热难当
freezing in winter,scorching hot in summer.
然而学生们被他们的热情所驱动
And yet the students are driven by their passion.
他们继续学习 奇迹继续发生在他们身上
And they continue. Miracles continue to happen to them.
Marva Collins所有的学生
Every one of Marva Collins' students graduates
都从小学毕业了
from elementary school.
所有学生都上了高中并毕业了
Everyone goes to high school and graduates from high school.
她所有的学生最后都上了大学
Every one of her students ends up in college
并从大学毕业
and graduates from college.
没错 那些"不可教"的学生
Yes,those "unteachable" ones.
Marva Collins数十年生活困苦
Marva Collins lives in a dire poverty for decades,
然而她努力平衡收支
somehow making ends meet.
毕竟 她的学生都无法付学费
After all,most of her students can't pay.
但是 月继一月 她熬过去了
But somehow,months to months,she makes it.
1979年 情况一夜发生了变化
1979 it changes overnight.
CBS《60分钟》的制片人

他们的惩罚就是要写100个原因
their punishment is they have to write 100 reasons
说明为什么他们棒到要做那样的事
why they are too wonderful to do what they are doing.
而且它们要按字母顺序写

一直写到最后一个字母 如果他们再犯
And it goes on to z. And if they do it again,
他们必须要用另一个同义词

她传递的信息是什么?
So what's her message?
首先
First of all,
她本身就是榜样
she herself is the message as a role model.
她和孩子们学习榜样
And she studied with her kids,role models.
他们读小说 历史书
They read fiction books. They read historical books.
他们读关于英雄的书 谈论英雄的事
They read books about heroes and talk about heroes.
他们都认清了谁是榜样
They all identify role models.
他们从社区里挑出榜样
They identify role models in their neighborhood,
在家庭里挑出榜样 不断地这样做
in their families,constantly doing that,
这就是你培养心理弹性要做的事
which is exactly what you need to cultivate resilience.
首先 她就是榜样
First and foremost,she herself is the role model.
她有着很高的期望

Marva Collins并不是软弱的人
Marva Collins is no push-over.
教室里的她要求很严格
If you see her in the classroom,she is tough. She is demanding.
同时 她尊重每个人
At the same time,she respects each individual.
她不是不切实际的"感觉良好"
She is not one of the Pollyannish "feel-good",
我们不惜一切代价让他们感觉良好
"let's make them all feel good" at all cost.
根本不是
Not at all.
她相信他们 她尊重他们
She believes in them.She respects them.
而且她要求很严格
And she is tough and demanding--
这是领导的重要因素
important combination for leadership.
这就是为什么我之前提到
It's why I mentioned earlier

in the context of great leadership book.
有很多非常和善的前总裁

帮助他们为自己和社区设立目标

最后
And finally,
从专注缺点到专注优点
from focusing on deficiencies to focusing on strength.
来自教育学校的Howard Gardner
Howard Gardner from the ED(Education) school here talks about
谈到了多元智力 他说我们要停止问
multiple intelligences,says that we need to stop asking
一个学生是否聪明
whether or not a student is smart.
我们要问这个学生有什么优点
What we need to ask is what is the student smart at.
认清这个学生的优点
And when we identify what that student is smart at,
长处之后 我们便欣赏它
strong at,virtuous at,good at,then we appreciate it.
当我们欣赏它的时候

优点和那整个人都会增值

假如有一粒种子...种子是有潜力的

flower,tree-- what would happen to a seed,
如果它没有受到灌溉 没有阳光照耀会怎样?
if it is not watered,if no light is shed on it?
它会枯萎死去
It will wither and die.
01:08:52,280 --&gt; 01:08:54,860
人类的潜力也是这样
The exact same thing with human potential.
如果我们不灌溉它 如果我们不照耀它
If we don't water it,if we don't shed a light on it,
它会枯萎死去
it will wither and die.
人际关系也是这样
The same with interpersonal relationship potential.
如果我们...我们会经常谈到关系
If we don't-- we'll talk a lot about relationships:
如何培养健康长期的关系
how to cultivate healthy long-term relationships--
如果你不灌溉它 不照耀它
if you don't water it,if you don't shed light,
如果你不欣赏它的好处 好处就会贬值
if you don't appreciate the good,the good will depreciate.
本质上
Essentially,
Marva Collins所做的
what Marva Collins does is create for students--
也就是心理弹性的作用就是
what the research in resilience does is
缔造一个与传统智慧不同的榜样
create a very different model than the conventional wisdom.
范式转移实质上是从被动接受者...
The paradigm shift essentially is from being a passive victim
也就是政府没有投入足够资金
because the government is not putting enough money,
这是一个问题 应该重视
which is an issue,not belittling it.
用外部条件 比如资源
It's important to have those external
影响内在性格很重要
affect the internal like more resources.
但那并不足够
But that's not enough.
从一个不积极 被动的受害者
From an inactive,from a passive victim,
成为一个主动的人 她改变了看法
she changes her perspective to be an active agent.
你并非"不可教"
You are not "unteachable".
你可以发展 你可以做好 你可以成功
You can thrive. You can do well.You can succeed.
而她所做的实质上
And what she does,essentially,
就是把他们带到连续体的极点
is take them to the extreme of continuum,because every event,
因为每件事每个人都处于连续体的某处
every person can be situated somewhere along this continuum,
我是说 不同的地方和不同的事物
I mean different places with different things.
想想你自己的生活
Think about your own life.
你是哪种人?
What are you,
各种情况的被动受害者还是主动者?
passive victim in different situations or an active agent?
例如 假如说我女朋友离开了我
For example,let's say my girlfriend leaves me.
当我还是这里的学生的时候
I know when I was an undergrad here.
我主要想的是 我女朋友要离开我了
This was top on my mind: girlfriends leaving me.
是的
Yes.
那点我们以后再谈
We'll talk about that later in this semester
当我们熟悉彼此之后
when we get to know one another a little bit better.
现在我有点害羞
I'm a little bit shy at this point.
但是假如我女朋友离开了我
But let's say my girlfriend leaves me.
如果我是被动受害者 那我只会自怜
If I am the passive victim,what I experience is self-pity.
为自己感到难过 思考
Feel sorry for myself. ruminate-- remember the word?
思考这种情况以及它有多糟糕
Ruminate about the situation and how terrible it is.
我从一个被动受害者变成抱怨者
她很糟糕
From a passive victim,I then move to blame: she's terrible;
都是她的错 我怨她
it's her fault; I blame her;
我抱怨我的父母 他们养育不当
I blame my parents,the way they raise me;
我抱怨她的父母 我抱怨布什总统
I blame her parents; I blame President Bush or whomever.
抱怨之后 我变得沮丧和愤怒
And after I blame,I experience frustration as well as anger.
对她生气 对我父母生气 对她父母生气
Anger toward her,toward my parents,her parents,
布什总统 希拉里 总之我很愤怒
President Bush,Hilary,whoever it is. I feel anger.
结果呢 很少结果
And results-- very few results.
因为我沉迷于反思和自怜中
Because I wallow in illumination and self-pity.
我们再反观积极主动者
Let's take the other extreme of the active agent.
首先 从定义来看 我会行动
First of all,by definition,I take action.
我承担责任
I take responsibility.
经历痛苦之后我会到处走走
I go on to places after experiencing the pain--
它很痛苦 下节课我们会谈谈
it's painful,and next time we are going to talk about
经历痛苦的重要性
the importance of experiencing the pain of giving ourselves
谈谈允许自己人性化
what I called the permission to be human,
但是我经历痛苦之后 我会行动
but once I experience it,I take action.
我去能认识他人的地方
I go out there to places where I will meet someone.
我去匹诺曹(哈佛的比萨店)
I go to Pinnochio's (Pizza place at Harvard).
或者另一个约会地点
Or another meeting place,the Stax in Whitener (?).
我想时世变迁了
Well I guess things have changed
现在的哈佛和我毕业时的不同了
at Harvard since I was an undergrad.
我承担责任
I take responsibility for it.
这样做的结果是...
And then as a result of that--
我们会谈谈自我知觉理论
and we'll talk about research on self-perception theory,
它是Daryl Bem的研究
research by Daryl Bem.
我们会详细讨论它 你不用现在把它写下来
We'll talk a lot about it. You don't need to write it down now.
我会行动 行动会增加我们的自信
I'll take action and action will increase our level of confidence
结果是更多的希望和乐观
And then more hope and optimism is a result.
就像在自我应验预言课程中所说的
As we talk about belief in self-fulfilling prophecy lecture,
希望和乐观会变成自我应验预言
hope and optimism become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
我更容易找到伴侣
I'm much more likely to find someone.
我更可能变得开心
I'm certainly much more likely to be happy.
重申一次 作为积极主动者
Once again,being an active agent
并不意味着不给我们自己时间
does not mean not giving ourselves the time,
空间去让自己感受痛苦的情感
the space,the permission to experience painful emotions,
以及摆脱这种情感
to go through the emotion.
没错 我们一定会摆脱它 然而
Yes,by all means,we go through it. However,
我们要在适合的时间...
what it is also saying is that we need to find the right time--
它可能是现在 可能是一两天后
it could be immediately,it could be a day or two later--
去行动 去承担责任 去做事情 这样
to take action,to take responsibility,to do things so that
我们对希望和乐观的自信就会增加
our confidence levels in our hope and optimism increase.
我要说几件关于
I want to just say a few things about this idea
做一个积极主动者及责任的事
of being an active agent and responsibility.
它可以融入你的哈佛生活 这取决于你
It applies to your life here at Harvard. It is up to you.
让你的哈佛时光充满意义
It is your responsibility to make the most out of
是你的责任
your Harvard experiences.
从这门课程学尽量多的东西是你的责任
It is your responsibility to make the most out of this class.
我们作为教师
We,the teaching staff,
肯定会为它创造条件
are certainly going to create conditions for it.
我们会以各种方式支持你们
We are going to support you in every way that you need.
然而 最终
However,ultimately,
小组讨论是你们的责任
it's your responsibility to do it in section.
作出行动是你们的责任
It's your responsibility to make it.
下周你们在小组里
One of the first questions that you'll be asking question
首先要问的问题之一就是
in section next week when they start to meet is
"你如何让它成为一个优秀的小组?"
"how can you make this an excellent section?"
"你能做什么? 你能有什么贡献?"
"What can you do?" "what can you bring?
"你能给小组带来什么优势"
What strength can you bring into the section
"让它成为一个优秀的小组?"
so that it's an excellent section?"
而不是抱怨其他学生 组长 布什 克林顿
As opposed to blaming,other students,TF,Bush,Clinton,whoever
你要为它承担责任
Taking responsibility for it.
关于责任 有一个很好的故事
There is a wonderful story about responsibility
Nathaniel Branden的书里提到了
in the book by Nathaniel Branden.
1354
当我们谈到自尊时
We are going to read some stuff by Nathaniel Branden
我们要读点Nathaniel Branden的东西
when we talk about self-esteem.
Nathaniel Branden谈到了六根支柱
Nathaniel Branden talks about six pillars
自尊的六根重要支柱
six important pillars in self-esteem.
其中一根就是自我负责
One of those pillars is self-responsibility.
自尊心强的人会承担责任
People who have high self-esteem take responsibility.
想培养高自尊心
People who want to cultivate high self-esteem
培养自信的人会承担责任
and create confidence,take responsibility
承担生活的责任等等
for their lives and so on.
在他的研讨会上 他在书中说到的
So in his workshop,one of the main things that he says
主要一件事就是 明白你必须
there in his book is that understanding that you have to
为生活承担责任就是理解
take responsibility for your life is recognizing understanding
没人会来
that no one is coming.
1367
没人会来...穿着闪亮铠甲的骑士
No one is coming to-- the knight in shining armour
不会来带你到幸福乐园
who will take you to the happily-ever-after land.
没人会来让你的生活更美好
No one is coming to make your life better for you.
没人会来
No one is coming.
你为自己的生活负责 获得自信
You are responsible for your life,for your self-confidence,
自尊 幸福
for your self-esteem,for your happiness.
没人会来
No one is coming.
他在研讨会上谈到了这个
So he was talking about this in one of his workshops
那是一个为期三天的研讨会
that's a three-day workshop.
这已经是第三天了
And this was already on the third day
研讨会进展顺利
and the workshop was going well.
参与者都学到了很多
The participants were getting a lot out of it.
他说 他告诉他们没人会来
And he said,he told them about this idea that no one is coming.
其中一名参与者举手说
And one of the participants raises his hand and says,
"Branden博士 事实并非这样"
"Dr. Branden,that's not true."
Nathaniel Branden问他"为什么?" 他说
And Nathaniel Branden asks him,"What do you mean?" And he says,
"Branden博士 你来了" Branden回应道
"Dr. Branden,you came",to which Branden responded,
"没错 我来了 但我是来告诉你没人会来"
"Yes,I came. But I came to tell you that no one is coming."
没人会来
No one is coming.
能否最大限度地从这次经历中获益全在于你
It's up to you to make the most out of this experience,
1504号课程 你的小组 你的哈佛经历等等
1504,your sections,your Harvard experiences and beyond.
我们作为教师
And we,as the teaching staff,
我们迫不及待想为之创造适合条件
can't wait to create the right conditions for that to happen.
