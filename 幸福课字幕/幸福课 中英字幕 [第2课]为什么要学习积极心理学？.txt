幸福课 中英字幕 [第2课]为什么要学习积极心理学？
早上好Hi. Good morning.很高兴你们都来了I'm so glad that you came.我还担心在这种天气没人会来I was worried that no one would show up in this weather.很高兴你们都很好I'm glad you are Ok.首先做几个声明Just a couple of announcements.我通过邮件收到的几个问题Questions that I received via email.在开始课程之前我要说的几件事情A few things before we jump into the material.首先 有人问我"这门课程是为谁设置的?"First of all,I was asked,"who is this class for?"这是积极心理学"Is it for people-- you know it's positive psychology --"它是为非常不开心的人设置的吗?"people that are very unhappy?"它只是为抑郁的人设置的吗?"Is it only for people who are depressed?"这门课程是为谁设置的?"who is this class for?"这门课程的授课对象是Well,the class is for anyone who is interested in对积极心理学有兴趣的人及想更开心的人Positive psychology and anyone who wants to be happier.如果你非常开心 你还可以更开心If you are extremely happy,you can still be happier.如果你非常不开心 你也可以更开心If you are very unhappy,you can still be happier.所以这门课程适合任何so the class essentially is for anyone对它感兴趣的人who's interested in the material-我会邀请有兴趣投入and I would add someone who is really interested to work,我们上次谈到的那种努力的人上来to put the kind of effort that we talked about last time.你不需要投入那种Just not the kind of effort that we would require you to为了明白某个概念而大为头痛的努力wreck your head about understanding certain concept,而是努力把这些观念融入你的生活but it is effort in terms of applying these ideas to your lives.也许你之所以上这门课程Now you may want to take this class,是因为你对积极心理学的理论感兴趣because you are interested on academic level in positive这也没问题psychology that's perfectly fine.你将会得到很多...And you'll get many--我们每节课都会谈到非常多的研究we'll talk about numerous studies in every lecture,从下节课开始starting next time.我们将接二连三地谈到那些研究We'll talk about study after study after study,所以你也可以得到理论方面的知识so you'll get that element as well.但是 如果你修积极心理学However,if you are thinking about taking positive psychology是为了个人利益 那么你就需要努力for personal benefits,you need to put the effort in.对此今天我会作进一步的阐述And I'll talk more about that today.所以这门课程任何人都可以修So the class is for everyone.包括那些非常开心而且想更开心的人Anyone who's extremely happy and wants to be happier,及那些不开心但是想更开心的人and anyone who's not happy and wants to be happier.考试成绩 这不是个问题Pass/fail-- perfectly fine.这门课程的宗旨以你们的利益为上Again the idea about this class is first and foremost for you.所以我建议如果你想及格So I would urge you if you do take pass那么就要努力and fail to put in the work,因此是否及格的决定因素之一and that's why the one element of pass/fail is not negotiable is就是所有的回应报告必须交上来that all the response papers have to be submitted.回应报告不会评分Now the response papers,as you know,are not graded.它们基本上就是心得体会They are basically reflection papers.也就是你会思考能够融入Will you reflect about the ideas about things你的生活的想法和事情吗?that can be applied to your life?它们是必需要交的But they are required.你交上来 你就及格So you hand them in,you pass.不交就不及格If you don't hand them in,you fail.除此之外But other than that,by all means,如果你想参加考试 那也没问题if you want to take this class pass/fail,it's perfectly fine.第三件事Third thing,在这门课程你将会接触很多理论和观点you'll be exposed to many theories,to many ideas in this class.不是所有理论观点都会引起你的共鸣Not everything would resonate of you.2008年出版了一本很棒的书There's a wonderful book just came out in 2008,就在两周前 书名叫《快乐之道》just two weeks ago,called "The How of Happiness"它由Sonja Lyubomirsky所著by Sonja Lyubomirsky.在书中她谈到了一个概念...And there she talks about the concept--她是加州大学河滨分校的教授she's a professor at Riverside (UC),哈佛大学的毕业生 斯坦福大学的研究生Harvard college graduate and went to Stanford for graduate school她谈到了找到"适合"的重要性she talks about the importance of finding fit,63也就是某种方法meaning the fit between certain technique,某种工具 某种观点是否适合你or tool,or idea,and yourself.并不是你听到的每种观点Not every idea,每种研究not every study that you've heard about,以及你运用的每种介入方法...not every intervention that you actually practice你在生活中将会运用介入方法and you will practice interventions in your life,不管是作善举whether it's doing acts of kindness,还是表达感激whether it's expressing gratitude,还是体育锻炼 还是写日记whether it's physical exercising,whether it's journaling.这些事情你在整个学期里都要做You will do all these things throughout the semester.然而并不是一切都适合你Not everything would be right for you.你将会接触它You'll be exposed to it.尝试它You'll try it.然后你将作出决定And then you'll make up your mind,"对 我想把它融入到生活中""yes,this is what I want to incorporate"或者"不 它对我没什么意义"or "no,this is just not relevant for me."所以记住这一点很重要So it's important to keep that in mind.我所说的一切都有研究论证Anything that I talk about is backed by research,但是研究没有说它适合所有人but the research doesn't say it's right for everyone.它说这对于大多数人或者对于很多人It says it's for most people or for many people;都有作用或者正在起作用this has worked or it is working.所以你要积极参与到课程中So again be an active participant in this class而非某种学说的被动接受者as opposed to passive recipient of a doctrine.鉴别哪些东西适合你...不是一切东西And identify the things that work for you-- not everything.我敢说并非一切东西都适合你I guarantee not everything will work for you,但是有很多东西会适合你but a lot of things will.关于我之前提到的回应报告Your response papers that I just mentioned earlier:它们在下午五点钟就要交 很抱歉they are due at 5 pm,sorry,从下周二开始你将在每周二下午五点收到you'll get them by 5 pm on Tuesday,starting next Tuesday.然后在周日下午五点前交到你的任务组And they will be due at 5 pm on Sunday to your TF.回应报告对大多数人来说Again the response papers are usually for most people fun,都是有趣而好玩的活动interesting and engaging activities.它不会评分 它让你去思考Not graded,just basically for you to reflect,并通过它们去成长for you to grow through them.要写论文的人Thesis writers.你们中有多少人要写论文?How many of you are thesis writers?请举手让我看看Just so I get a show of hand here.好的 很抱歉 我没有在开玩笑Ok,I am sorry. No I'm kidding.要写论文的人 你们不用参加期中考试Thesis writers: you'll not need to take the midterms.我知道那段时间里非常紧张...I know it's crunch time around that time-我自己也经历过那段时期being through it myself here.所以你们不用参加期中考试So you'll not have to take the midterm.你的期末考占更多分数Your final will account for more.除非你想参加期中考试Unless you want to take the midterm,当然我们非常欢迎你参加of course you'll more than welcome to.我们不会把你扔到教室外面we won't throw you out of the classroom.写论文的人可以不用参加Your thesis writers may.网上将会有很多公告There'll be many announcements online.请经常查看网站Do check the website on the regular basis.我们会发布很多东西 而不是向你发邮件We communicate a lot of things. Instead of sending you emails,我们会发布公告we'll have the announcements.需要经常查看一下 大概每天六七次Check them regularly,about 6 7 times a day.这只是开玩笑Just kidding.一两天一次就已经足够了Once a day or once every two days is more than enough.在开始课程之前...I'd like Before I do jump into the material今天的课程非常令人兴奋and we have a very exciting lecture today,我们会邀请进修学院任务组组长Deb Levyto invite Deb Levy who is the head TF for extension school--哈佛进修学院的同学们so extension school students,我知道该学院的一些同学在这里I know there are a couple of you here,还有一些在家里...those of you at home--有请 Deb Levyhere she is.

Thank you Deb.我想以一个故事开始今天的课程So I want to start with a story,那是两年前发生在我身上的事something that happened to me exactly 2 years ago,恰好两年just about to the day,那是我上次教积极心理学的最后一节课when was the last time when I taught positive psychology.那学期开始的时候As the semester started,同时那是压力很大的一个时期 我的导师it was a very stressful period also,my mentor,我要把这节课程who I am dedicating this class as well as以及将来的积极心理学课程献给all my future positive psychology class is to,在课程开始前一天去世的Philip StonePhilip Stone passed away just the day before the class started.那时候我压力非常大Very stressful period.我生病了 病得非常严重And I got sick. And I got very sick.然而我还是上完了课Somehow I got through the class.我教授周四的课程 它从两年前开始I taught the Thursday class. That started 2 years ago.课程在周二上It started on Tuesday. So I taught on Tuesday.后来改为周四 我服了很多药Somehow Thursday,completely drugged.然而我还是上完了课This lecture I made it through somehow.我回家后无法入睡And I went to home  and I couldn't fall asleep.我感到非常痛 所以我去看医生了I was in real pain. I went to the doctors.那是周五下午 我说That was on Friday afternoon,just saying"我必须要看医生 我服的药不起作用""you know I have to go. The medication I took didn't help."我去看了医生 验了血Went to the doctors. Had some blood tests.几天无法入睡之后And finally after days I couldn't sleep由于痛苦我终于睡着了because of pain,fell asleep.那是周五晚上This was Friday night.午夜的时候电话响了In the midnight,there was a phone call.我没有去接 我很快睡着了I don't hear it. I am fast asleep.我的妻子Tommy拿起了话筒My wife picks it up. Tommy picks it up.那是医生打来的It's the doctor.医生对Tommy说And the doctor says to Tommy,结果出来了"the test results just came in.Tal要立刻到医院来And Tal should get to the hospital now."她对医生说She said to the doctor,他刚睡着 他几天没睡了"He just fell asleep. He hasn't slept for days.能不能等到明天再去?Can it wait til tomorrow morning?"医生说 不行 他要到Beth Israel医院And the doctor said,"No. And he has to go to Beth Israel,那里有最好的实验室可以给他提供治疗because they have the best labs for what he needs right now."她没有再说And she doesn't elaborate it any more.Tommy叫醒了我 告诉我发生的事Tommy wakes me up,retells me the story of what's happening.我起来了Somehow I get up.她不能带我去医院 因为DavidShe can't take me to the hospital because David,当时他才一岁 他正在睡觉at that time one year old,is asleep.我们不想叫醒他We don't want to wake him up.我们叫了一辆计程车带我到Beth Israel医院So we get a cab to take me to Beth Israel.路上...这是我不做On the way-- so this was the yearLeverett的常驻导师资格的第二年after I was no longer resident tutors in Leverett.我们驶经查尔斯河We were (?),driving down the Charles River.然后我们经过哈佛Up and drive and then next to Harvard.我当时看着哈佛 看着美丽的河I look at Harvard. I look at the beautiful river.四周静悄悄It's very quiet.周五午夜之后没有多少车辆Not many cars just after midnight on a Friday night.我情不自禁地想And I can't help myself but think,如果情况真的很严重呢?"what if there's something really terrible going on?"他们为什么午夜叫我去医院I mean,why would they call me midnight to the hospital--还指定是Beth Israel医院?Beth Israel,insisting on just one specific hospital?一定是出了很严重的问题There must be something really wrong.我开始思考And my mind begins to wander.我说And I say,如果我只剩下一年时间呢? 我在这一年里会做什么?"what if I only have a year left? What would I do in that year?"我变得非常伤心 因为我看不到David长大I become very sad because I think I won't see David grow up.我以后再也不会有孩子I won't see-- I won't have any future children.在上面要小心谨慎Be careful up there.我变得十分忧郁悲伤And I become very wistful and sad.然后我问自己 好的 在职业上And then I ask myself,"Ok so professionally,我在最后一年想做什么?what would I want to do in that last year?"我知道在生活在我要做什么So I know personally exactly what I'll do.我会用所有时间和家人一起度过I'll spend all the time that I can with my family.但是在职业上在这一年我想完成什么?But professionally what do I want to accomplish in this year?我的第一反应就是And my immediate response was我要留下一个系列的课程I want to leave behind a coherent body of work,一个向人们介绍积极心理学的系列课程a coherent course introducing people to positive psychology.我到达医院之后再进行了一些检查While I arrived at the hospital,I had some more checks.结果是没什么严重情况It ends up being nothing too serious.他们让我服抗生素They put me on antibiotics.几天之内我就开始复原了And within a couple of days I am on the way to recovery.但是今天我要和你们探讨I want to share with you today though why.为什么对我最重要的事情...Why is it the most important thing for me那时和现在都是如此at that time and still today,就是留下一系列is to leave behind a coherent body of work关于积极心理学的课程about positive psychology,向你们介绍这个奇妙的领域?to introduce you to this wonderful field?为什么是积极心理学?为什么是这个领域?Why positive psychology?Why is it? Its own field?为什么不只是研究Why is it not--well,just study happiness,社会心理学或临床心理学的幸福?wellbeing as part of social psychology or clinical psychology?为什么世界上这么多学者Why have so many scholars around the world都在研究积极心理学这个概念?united around this concept of positive psychology?这是我今天要说的So this is what I want to do today.2000年 David Myers做了一项研究In the year of 2000,a research was done by David Myers.霍普学院的David Myers 你们当中学过Davis Myers,from Hope College-- some of you社会心理学的可能读过他的书who've studied social psychology may have read his textbook,他做了心理学概念方面的研究did research,looking at psychological abstracts.他研究的是What he looked at was the ratio"消极研究"和"积极研究"之间的比率between "negative research" and "positive research".这是他的研究结果Here is what he found.从1967年到2000年From 1967 to year of 2000-这是积极心理学的形成期this was around the time when positive psychology started,他发现在这33年里有5000篇文章研究愤怒what he found in the 33 years are over 5000 articles on anger,5000篇文章研究愤怒5000 research articles on anger.超过41000篇文章研究焦虑He found over 41000 research articles on anxiety还有超过54000篇研究抑郁and over 54000 articles on depression.然后他看看积极的概念 积极的研究And then he looked at the positive words,positive research.他寻找关于快乐的研究He looked for research on joy.他仅仅找到了415篇研究And he found staggering 415 studies.情况会有所改善It does get better.他寻找关于幸福的研究He looked at research on happiness他发现在33年里有接近2000篇文章研究幸福and he found close to 2000 articles on happiness in 33 years.生活满意度研究最多 超过2500篇研究文章Life satisfaction came on top: over 2500 studies.但是 如果你看看Still,if you look at that,消极研究和积极研究的对比the negative studies versus the positive studies,你得到的比率是21比the ratio that you get is 21 to 1.每份研究某个积极方面For every one article on some positive aspect,积极因素的文章some positive element of life,不管是研究健康 满意程度 快乐还是幸福wellbeing,satisfaction,joy,happiness,都有21份消极方面的文章 包括抑郁 焦虑you get 21 articles on depression,anxiety,精神分裂 神经衰弱等等schizophrenia,neurosis and so on.21比1的比率Ratio of 21 to 1.我得承认这是非常令人郁闷的比率Very depressing ratio,I must admit.实际上它让我非常生气和忧虑In fact,it made me very angry and anxious.那些研究主要集中于不起作用的东西上Studies focus on,primarily on what doesn't work,大部分都是这样 而且这也不是新现象mostly on what doesn't work. And this is not a new phenomenon.这是Abraham Maslow写的一些东西Here is something from Abraham Maslow,我们上次提到过他who we mentioned last time,他在1954年谈到过这种现象talking about this phenomenon in 1954:"心理学这一学科对于消极方面的研究""The science of psychology has been far more successful"远比对于积极方面的研究成功"on the negative than on the positive side."它向我们展示了人类的短处"It has revealed to us much about man's shortcomings,"他的缺点 他的过失"his illnesses,his sins,"但很少谈到他的潜能 他的长处"but little about his potentialities,his virtues,"他的实际愿望或精神高度"his achievable aspirations or his psychological height."好像心理学自愿固步自封"It is as if psychology had voluntarily restricted itself to only"让自己仅限于研究黑暗低劣的一半"half its rightful jurisdiction and that darker,meaner half."心理学研究什么?So what does psychology study?学心理学的人I mean the psychology concentrators here know that,可能会猜probably guess that.我们大量地研究偏见We study a lot of prejudice.我们大量地研究抑郁和焦虑We study a lot depression and anxiety.我们大量地研究相似性We study a lot about conformity.我们大量地研究判断错误和过失We study a lot about misjudgments and errors,大概就是专门研究这方面而很少...very much focusing on this aspect and very little--21比1的比率表明很少研究积极方面again,21 to 1,very little-- on the positive.看到这个比率时 我想And when I look at this ratio and I think about it,那是1954年 到现在也没多大改变this is 1954-- hasn't changed much since.当我思考它调查它的时候And when I think about it and I look into it,我觉得心理学需要帮助I think that psychology needs help.我真的这样觉得I really do.你可以从个人的角度想想它I mean think about it at a personal level.如果一个人一天里有21小时感到消沉that if you had a person who 21 hours a day was depressed而只有一个小时感觉良好会怎样?and one hour in a day felt good?或者有一天感觉良好 便有21天觉得焦虑Or one day feeling good and then 21 days feeling anxious和消沉会怎样?and depressed?你会说这个人需要帮助You would say that this person would need help.我觉得这个领域需要帮助And the field I think,needs help.但问题是 这是正确的比喻吗?But the question becomes "is it the right analogy?"我们应该这样去看待它吗?Should we look at it this way?因为21比1的比率是不健康的Because the 21 ratio is unhealthy,从个人的角度来看肯定也是这样certainly would be so on the individual level,但是它从多个角度反映了现实but it reflects reality in many ways.因为我们今天所看到的Because what we are seeing today是越来越多的研究表明in more and more research showing that there is more and more世界上出现了越来越多的抑郁症depression around the world,还有越来越多的焦虑 东南西北that there is more and more anxiety,east,west,north,south--世界各地around the world.有些人会争辩道...And one could argue--那些主张继续研究这片领域people who argue for continuing to do research in this area,而少点研究积极心理的人认为for doing less in positive psychologies,--我们应该让这个比率大于21比well we should be doing even more than the 21 to 1 ratio,因为我们想缓和人们受到的because we want to alleviate the anxiety焦虑和抑郁and depression that people experience.今天的抑郁症病例比1960年高十倍Today depression is 10 times higher than it was in 1960.部分的原因是人们的意识程度高了Now part of it is because there's more awareness,我们对抑郁症的诊断更准确because we measure better.但这并非全部原因But that's not all.还因为抑郁症在客观上增加了It's also simply because objectively there's more depression.其中的一种迹象就是 最客观的"诊断"And one way of knowing that is that the most objective "measure"不幸的是 就是自杀that we have is unfortunately suicide.自杀人数在世界范围内明显上升And numbers have risen significantly around the world,327不仅是在美国not just in the United States--不管是在中国 澳大利亚还是这里whether it's in China,whether it's Australia-- as well as here.现在抑郁症人群的平均年龄小于15岁The mean age for depression today is less than 15.孩子们在很小的时候就接触了Kids at very young age are introduced to the信息高速公路"information highway".通常来说他们都没有准备好And very often,they are not prepared,他们无法有效地应对它not able to deal with it in an effective way.所以当我们看到这个数据时So when we look at this data,我们认为我们需要更多的研究帮助人们we say we do need more research to help people克服抑郁症 克服焦虑overcome depression,to help people overcome anxiety.这应引起足够的重视And I don't want to belittle that.这非常重要 极度的重要That is important. It is extremely important.我主张的What I'm arguing,what I will argue for,是天平的偏移is the shift of the pendulum.这样它将不会再是21比So it's no longer 21 to 1.要有更多的研究关于积极心理学There are more,many more studies in positive psychology,不是要只研究它 根本不是-- not to the exclusion of,not at all,而是让天平偏移一点but just shifting the pendulum.这里的情况如何?How about here?我们的象牙塔里的情况如何?In our local village?有一篇文章...我无法找到更新的研究This article,-- I couldn't find a study that is more recent,它是在2004年发表的this was published in 2004.《哈佛克里姆森》Harvard Crimson (http://www.thecrimson.com/).这篇文章说 经过他们6个月的研究This article says that,in their 6 months study of this,哈佛大学八成的学生在过去一年80% of Harvard students experienced depression都经历过抑郁期over the past year.我们说的不是大多数人一天里Now we are not talking about the regular ups and downs经常出现的情绪起伏 我也是如此that most people have ten times a day-- I certainly do.我们说的是抑郁We are talking about depression here.它会持续一段时间For an extended period of time.根据这份研究 47%的哈佛学生...47% of Harvard students,according to this,--这不是学术研究and grant it: this is not academic study,但是我待会就和你们分享学术研究but I will share with you academic study in a minute,它发表在高级期刊上published in a top-tier refereed journal.但是克里姆森里的研究表明But Crimson has founded in its survey47%的哈佛学生在过去一年that 47% Harvard students over the past year经历过无法正常生活学习的抑郁期have experienced depression to the point of not functioning.他们无法出门So they couldn't leave home.他们要痛苦地度日They were really struggling to just basically get through the day.47%的人47%.人们看到这个数据的时候 他们说Now when people look at this,they say"当然了 我们要努力研究精神病理学""well of course,we need to focus more on psychopathology."21比1还不足够 30比1才像样"21 to 1-- not enough! 30 to 1 sounds more like it."这样的情况各个校园都有We see it around campuses.而不仅仅是哈佛This is not peculiar to Harvard.绝对不是哈佛才有的现象Not at all peculiar to Harvard.Richard KadisonRichard Kadison,他是这里的心理健康服务中心的领导who is the head of mental health services here,他最近在医学领域的领先杂志in the New England Journal of Medicine--《新英格兰医学杂志》上probably the leading journal in the field of Medicine,发表了一篇文章recently published an article,他谈到了一项调查where he talked about a survey调查对象是全国13500名大学生that was done among 13500 college students nationwide,他们来自不同类别的学院different kinds of colleges,大学 公立学校 私立学校universities,states schools,private schools.他们在这项重要的研究里发现And what they found in this very significant study全国45%的大学生在过去一年was that 45% of college students nationwide over the past year经历过无法正常生活学习的抑郁期have experienced depression to the point of not functioning.《哈佛克里姆森》的数据是47%So The Harvard Crimson found 47;在全国范围的数据是45% 基本上是一样nationwide,it was 45-- essentially identical,两者之间的差异并不大no significant difference among the two.这是一个全国性的现象This is a nationwide phenomenon.这份研究表明In this study,全国94%的大学生感到压抑94% of college students nationwide feel overwhelmed因为他们必须要做的事而不堪负重and stressed by everything that they have to do.94%94%.这本应该是我们一生中最美好的四年I mean these are supposed to be the best four years of our lives.事情不对劲Something is going on here.不仅是美国才有这种现象Now this is not unique to United States.我最近刚从一次游历回来I just recently came back from a tour.我到了欧洲 包括英国 法国I was in-- spent time in Europe-- in the UK,France;我在中国逗留了很久 也去了澳洲spent a lot of time in China and some time in Australia.所有这些地方In every one of these places,政府都非常担忧...the governments are really concerned;大学校长们都非常担忧university presidents are very concerned越来越多的抑郁现象about the growing level of depression,焦虑 精神紊乱anxiety and general mental disorder,自杀率的上升 上面提到的所有国家都是如此rise of suicide rates in all of these countries that I mentioned.所以这是全球性流行病So we have a global epidemic here.我们再看看 21比1的比率是好事吗?And once again going back so: Is it the 21:1 ratio good?它重要吗?它不是应该扩大吗?Is it important? Shouldn't it be increased?我们怎么可以去研究幸福How can we even think about studying happiness健康 爱和快乐?and well-being and love and joy?我们不是应该首先处理Shouldn't we first deal with真正迫切的问题吗? 比如抑郁the real pressing problem of depression,焦虑 神经衰弱等等anxiety,neurosis and so on?这样说确实有些道理--Some truth to that,但是在这个课程里我要主张的是but again what I'm going to argue for in this class我们也要...is that we do need to also,不是专门 也不用主要not only,not exclusively,not even necessarily primarily,我们也要集中研究积极心理学we need to also focus on the positive.我要说三个为什么应该这样做的理由I am going to talk about three reasons why we should do that.首先 集中研究有用的东西至关重要The first reason is that it is important to focus on what works,因为有用的或者集中研究的会成为现实because what works or what we focus on rather creates reality.如果我们集中研究起作用的If we focus on what is working,它就会在世界起更大的作用we'll have more working in our world,在我们身上以及关系上起更大作用more working in ourselves,more working in our relationships.其次 为什么积极心理学The second reason why positive psychology作为一门独立领域的研究学科as an independent field of study as a course in是重要的 这是因为快乐and of itself is important is that being happy并非只是对痛苦的否定is not just the negation of happiness.摆脱我正在经历的It doesn't mean just get rid of depression or anxiety抑郁或者焦虑并不意味着that I am experiencing,我同时就变得快乐了I spontaneously become happy.情况并非是这样 问题不会这样被解决That's not the case. That's not how it works.最后 预防在今天来说非常重要And finally,prevention which is very important today,预防困苦最有效的方法...the most effective way of preventing hardship,不管是抑郁还是焦虑-- whether it's depression,whether it's anxiety,实际上是通过专注于培养积极心态-- is actually by focusing on and cultivating the positive.我会跟你们分享一些关于这点的研究Now I will share with you some studies about this.这三个原因表明我们需要积极心理学So for these three reasons,we need positive psychology.我从专注于有效方法的重要性开始Let me begin with the importance of focusing on what works.在《积极心理学手册》的序言里In the introduction to the Handbook of Positive Psychology,我们上次提到的Martin Seligman...Martin Seligman who we talked about last time,他被认为是积极心理学之父considered the father of positive psychology,影响了很多学者 他说network of scholars,says this:"积极心理学的目标是促成一种变化""The aim of positive psychology is to catalyze a change"让心理学从只关注补救生活中最糟糕的事"in psychology from a preoccupation only with repairing the worst"到同时建立生活中最美好的事"things in life to also building the best qualities in life."请留意他说的是同时Note that he says also.他没有说专门 甚至没有说主要He doesn't say exclusively or even primarily.专注于研究有效的东西至关重要It's important to focus on what works,不管是对我们的关系 对我们自身-- whether it is in our relationship,whether it's in ourselves,对其他人 对哈佛whether it's in others,whether it's in Harvard,对美国还是对世界而言whether it's in United States or the world--这是为了获得更多有效的东西in order to have more what works.问题是"如何专注于研究有效的东西?"Now the question is "how do we focus on what works?"这个问题的答案And the answer to this question就在我们提出的问题的本身is through the questions that we ask.我通过一个案例研究来阐明这点Let me illustrate through a case study.心理学家在20世纪40年代末开始Psychologists,starting in the late 1940s,研究受危人群studied at-risk population.越来越多的钱 政府资金 大学资金More and more money-- government money,university money,慈善基金都投入到研究城市或地区里philanthropist money-- went into study in the cities or places所谓的受危儿童的身上where generally the kids were considered at risk--他们更容易退学more prone to dropping out of school,以后更容易犯罪 少女妊娠等等more prone to later-on crime,teen pregnancy and so on.他们为这项研究投入了大量金钱So this study they put in a lot of money,大量的精力a lot of effort into this.心理学家们问的问题是The question that the psychologists asked was"为什么这些人会失败""why do these individuals fail?00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,240"为什么受危人群中"why does such a high percentage of students in"有如此高比例的学生退学?"that as-risk population end up dropping out of school?"怀孕?犯罪?"Getting pregnant? Crime?"我们下周再谈统计数据--And we'll talk about the statistics later on next week."为什么他们当中有这么多人会失败?""Why do so many of these individuals fail?"他们提出了很重要的问题Now an important question,心理学家们动机良好 头脑灵活 投入了很多钱good intentions of the psychologists,smart people,lot of money,投入了很多资源lot of resources going in.然而 变化却非常少However,very little change was introduced.这些研究带来的变化微乎其微Very little change came about as results of these studies.很多地区的情况继续恶化And the situation in many areas continued to exacerbate.情况没有任何好转 虽然动机良好Certain didn't get any better,despite the good intentions,虽然资源充足 虽然人们头脑灵活despite the resources,despite the brain power它们都被投入去研究这个问题that twined into the researching into this question.得到的答案却非常有意思Interesting answers--我们需要更好的教育 更好的建筑well,we need better education,we need better buildings,更多的资源we need more resources,但是实际上发生的变化很少but very little change actually in practice came about.然后出现了一种范式And then there was a paradigm,20世纪80年代出现了范式转移quite literally a paradigm shift in the 1980s.通过Antonovsky的努力 我上次提到过他Through the work of Antonovsky who I mentioned last time今天我要再次提到他 通过Antonovskyand I'll mention again today,through the work of Antonovsky,及Ellen Langer和Alice Isen等其他人的努力and other people like Ellen Langer,other people like Alice Isen,心理学家们提出了不同的问题different questions started to be asked by psychologists.他们不去问为什么这些人会失败Instead of asking what did these individuals fail,积极心理学家开始问是什么让某些人positive psychologists started to ask what made some individuals成功了?即便面对的是不理想的环境?succeed despite unfavorable circumstances?也许是有很多人失败了 但并非所有人Maybe it was the case that many failed,but not everyone.有些人成功了 而且非常成功Some succeeded and succeeded big time.心理学家们此时便开始问 为什么And what psychologists started to do then was to ask why.为什么他们如此成功?What is it about them that is so successful?用Frost的话来说 这才是至关重要的And that,in the words of Frost,made all the difference.心理学家们开始识别这些人的各种因素The psychologists started to identify elements,以及各个方面并深入分析他们aspects of these individuals and studied them in depth,他们开始研究这些成功的人starting to study the successful individuals,并识别出各种因素and identify elements that they could then teach later然后他们通过研究想出介入方法in creating interventions based on what they had studied.突然间结果出来了 真正的结果And suddenly,there were results,real results,切实的结果 打破了数十年零结果的局面tangible results,after decades of virtually zero results,这仅仅是基于一个简单的问题simply based on the question.那时候出现的主要概念And the main concept that came out at that time,通过这些心理学家的研究through the research of these psychologists正是他们开始问积极的问题who started to ask the positive question,开始专注于研究成功的孩子们started to focus on what is working on the successful children.那时出现的概念是心理弹性The concept that came out was the concept of resilience.现在大家都在谈心理弹性Now today everyone talks about resilience.我们在学校谈心理弹性We talk about resilience in school,在工作上谈 在卧室里谈at work,in the job,in the bedroom.在哪里都谈心理弹性Everywhere resilience.然而 在20世纪80年代However,at that time in the 1980s,很少人谈及甚至很少人知道它的意思very few people even talked about or knew what that means.研究心理弹性的时候 它被定义如下When they studied resilience,which is defined as following,它的定义关系重大it made all the difference.心理弹性Resilience,--一种现象 特征是积极适应的模式a class of phenomena characterized by patterns of positive即使是面对非常不利或危险的环境adaptation in the context of significant adversity or risk.这些成功的孩子最终成功了These kids,who succeeded-- ended up succeeding,这是通过纵向研究得出的结论and they look through longitudinal studies--五年后 十年后 三十年后5 years later,10 years,30 years later,这些成功的孩子都具有适应力the kids who succeeded,were resilient.一开始 当他们研究这些孩子时Initially,when they studied these kids,他们认为这些孩子一定很优秀the assumption was these must be super kids,extraordinary kids,百里挑一甚至千里挑一one in a hundred,one in a thousand-因此是不可以模仿的not really replicable,therefore.然而However,当他们继续研究what they found when they continued to study这些成功的人时 继续研究虽然环境不理想those people who work,those people who succeeded,然而仍然成功的人时despite the unfavorable circumstances,他们发现这些并非是非常优秀的孩子-- what they found was these were not super kids.实际上这些是普通的孩子 他们性格普通In fact these were ordinary kids with ordinary characteristics但是成就非凡that led to extraordinary results.例如 我告诉你们几件事For example,let me share with you some of the things.这些孩子都很乐观These kids were optimistic,不是那种不切实际的盲目乐观-- not optimistic in the detached Pollyannish sense,而是乐观地相信-- optimistic in that they believe in things事情会被圆满地解决that would work out well,我们会经常把乐观主义当作诠释谈及and we'll talk a lot about optimism as an interpretation style,也就是Martin Seligman和karen Reivich的乐观主义in the work of Martin Seligman and karen Reivich.他们的乐观在于认为They were optimistic in the sense of thinking,"好吧 也许这次不会成功""well,it may not work well this time."它以后会成功的"It will work out later."我从刚发生的事学到了东西"I have learned from what had just happened."他们对生活有信心 认为它有意义They had faith and sense of meaning in life.有时它是宗教信仰 但却不总是这样Sometimes it was religious faith,not always.这种信仰是做他们相信的事It was doing something that they really believed in.他们中很多人都是理想主义者Many of them were idealistic.我们在这门课程里谈及的话题之一One of main topics we will discuss in this class is就是理想主义就是现实主义that to be idealistic is to be realistic,因为我们的内心需要理想主义because we have a real internal need,innate need for idealism.所以这些孩子有"意义感"So these kids experienced sense of meaning,不管是个人成功方面的意义whether it was meaning in terms of personal success以及他们的行事方式的意义and how I will make it,或者是服务社区的意义or sense of meaning in their community contributing,还有事情的目标意义something meaningful in sense of purpose.顺便说一下 我说的这一切By the way,when I go through all these,它们对所有人都一样重要these are no less important for any other person in the world.我们之前提到的心理弹性This resilience as we mentioned earlier不但对受危人群很重要is just not important for the at-risk population.对哈佛大学里的人也一样重要It's as important at Harvard.也不仅是在考试期间重要And not just during exam period.把心理弹性与幸福联系起来非常重要It's important that resilience is associated with wellbeing.思考这些特点 你就会展示它们So think about these characteristics and you display them.我在这里提到的这些特点And the interesting thing about all these characteristics你可以学到它们they can all be learned.有趣的一点就是它们都可以习得that I'll mention here is that they can all be taught;从多个方面来说 这门课程说的就是这个In many ways,this class is about that.当心理学家们识别出这些特点之后And when the psychologists identified these,他们开始教授它们 人们也开始学了they started to teach them and the individuals started to learn情况便发生了变化and that made all the difference.除了信心以及"意义感"In addition to the faith and sense of meaning,利社会行为 帮助他人pro-social behavior,helping other people,从无助转变到有益 它们都非常重要shifting from helplessness to helpfulness,they were significant.我们要讨论的事情之一就是One of the things that we'll talk about is帮助他人的意义how meaningful it is to help other people.它不但帮助他人And how much it doesn't just only help others,它还会帮助我们自己it also helps ourselves.我们便进入了自助和助他人的上升式螺旋里And we enter an upward spiral between self-help and other-help.因为我们帮助他人时也在帮助自己Because when we help others,we are helping ourselves.当我们帮助自己时在帮助他人when we help ourselves,we help others.循环往复And so on and so on.所以他们都是利社会者So they were pro-social.他们都在帮助别人They were helping other people.他们的眼光集中在自己的长处上They focused on their strength而不是缺点rather than primarily deficiencies.他们不忽视自己的缺点 但他们会问They did not ignore their weaknesses,but they asked,我真正擅长的是什么?"what am I good at? What am I really,really good at?"重申一次 这门课程的目标之一And again,part of this course,就是你会认清自己的长处you'll identify your strength,不管是通过线上测试whether it's through online test,通过回应报告whether it's through reflection papers,通过小组学习whether it's in section.还是通过阅读 你都会思考它You'll think about it whether it's through your readings.认清长处Identify the strength.他们擅长的是什么?What are they good at?他们为自己设立目标They set goals for themselves.他们面向未来They were future-oriented,他们不但思考事情现在有多糟糕not just thinking about how bad things are today perhaps,同时也在思考but also thinking about五年后或十年后的目标"this is where I wanna be 5 years or 10 years from now."607我们会用三节课谈论设立目标We are going to devote three classes to goal setting,这是心理弹性的重要组成部分very significant part of resilience.他们有一个榜样They had a role model.他们会说Someone who they said about"我想像她那样 我想像他那样""I want to be like her; I want to be like him."榜样可以是老师 可以是亲戚朋友It could be a teacher. It could be a parent,sibling,friend.有时候Sometimes,它是一个历史人物或小说的人物it was a historical figure or a fictional character,一个他们可以效仿的人someone that they want to emulate,to be like.榜样给予他们力量 给他们方向感That gave them strength. That gave them sense of direction.最后 最重要的就是他们不单干And finally,most significantly,they did not bowl alone.他们有社会的支持 他们不会说They had social support. They did not say :"我够能干 可以自己做""well I am tough enough to do it by myself."他们说"我够能干 我可以请求帮助"Rather they said :"I'm tough enough to reach out for help."因为那确实需要某种能力Because that does require certain toughness.还有承认弱点的勇气The strength to admit weaknesses as well,承认有某种需要的勇气the strength to admit a need.想想Now think about these:你在哈佛 在生活中你有这些东西吗?do you have these things here for yourself at Harvard in life?如果没有 你可以培养这一切And if not,you can cultivate all of these things,不管是社会支持...whether it's a social support--不用是每天and it doesn't have to be a hundred people与你交谈的一百人whom you talk to everyday;它可以是一两个好朋友 父母 室友it can be one or two close friends,mom,dad,roommates--这至关重要makes a big difference.它是心理弹性最重要的因素No. 1 contributor to resilience.社会支持重要的一点Now the important thing about social support就是找到适合的人is identifying the right people.那些你向他们请求帮助People who,when you reach out to them,便会给予回应的人will reach back to you and will be able to give back.现在我向你们展示一个并不太好的榜样I want to show you an example now of a not so good role model不太好的社会支持for social support.这是Grace和Karen之间的一段交流And that is an interaction视频片断来自剧集《Will and Grace》between Grace and Karen from Will and Grace.《Will and Grace》（第3季第9集）Will and Grace (From Episode 309):这台游戏机是份不错的生日礼物SALESMAN: This video game makes a nice birthday gift.你觉得你的继子会喜欢吗?Do you think your stepson would like that?我不知道 亲爱的KAREN: I don't know,honey.他可以吃它或者摩擦它吗?Can he eat it or rub up against it?我们换一种方式了解SALESMAN: Let's come at this a different way.他的兴趣是什么?What are his interests?火腿KAREN: Ham.还是你自己到处看看吧SALESMAN: Why don't I just let you browse awhile?好的 谢谢KAREN: Yeah. Thanks. Ooh,and,uh,你可以处理一下do you think there's anything you could do这些小孩吗?about all these kids in here?夫人 这是玩具店SALESMAN: Ma'am,it's a toy store.好的 处理一下KAREN: Yeah. See what you can do.别挡道 矮个子Move it,shorty.KarenGRACE: Hi,Karen. Um...今天我不能和你买东西了 我得走了I can't help you shop today. I've gotta go.怎么回事?发生什么事了?KAREN: What's going on? What's happening?为什么要装害羞?What's with the geisha hand?没什么GRACE: Nothing.我在皮肤科医生那里做了点手术I just had something zapped at the dermatologist's,看起来有点恐怖and it looks kinda funky,现在我不想任何人看到它and I just don't want anyone to see it right now.GraceKAREN: Grace,我敢说它并没有你想的那么糟糕I'm sure it's not nearly as bad as you think it is.也许不值一提 一个小点 让妈妈看看It's probably nothing,a little dot. Come on. Show mama.啊 我的天啊KAREN: Aah! Whoa! Oh! Oh,my God! Oh!嘘 Karen 冷静下来GRACE: Shh! Shhhhh! Karen,Will you calm down?你叫我怎么冷静下来?KAREN: How do you expect me to calm down我看到它的心脏在我面前跳动when I can see its heart beating right in front of me?! Aah!嘘GRACE: Shh!好的KAREN: Well,uh,alright.好的 非常抱歉Alright,I'm sorry.你患疱疹多久了？So how long have you had the herpes?这不是疱疹GRACE: It's not herpes.它跟疱疹挨不着边It's not even herpes adjacent.是吗?KAREN: Oh,yeah? Well,它可以参加疱疹的家庭野餐了it's close enough to be invited to the herpes family picnic.这是一个奇怪的雀斑GRACE: It was a weird freckle,医生想要冻结它and the doctor wanted to freeze it,然后他告诉我要十天才能复原and then he told me that it was going to take 10 days to heal.他怎么会认为我可以丑陋十天?I mean,what made him assume that I could look awful for 10 days?因此 我要拿着你的尼龙包擦它Respond to that,and I will rub it all over your Prada.你在看什么 大肚婆?KAREN: What are you lookin' at,prego?以前没见过疱疹吗?Haven't you ever seen herpes before?天啊 胖子真是麻木不仁Jeez. Fat people are so insensitive我的天啊 我的天啊GRACE: Oh,my God. Oh,my God.从这块小玩具镜照出来的样子看来Would you look at it in this little toy mirror?它变大了 就像芭比梦想中的青春痘It's gotten...bigger. It's like Barbie's dream zit.幸亏我取消了和Mark的约会Thank God I canceled my date with Mark.没错 因为它看起来KAREN: Yeah,'cause that thing looks like要交通柱和警察拦护带才能遮住it needs orange cones and police tape around it.来吧 我们离开这里GRACE: Come on. Let's get outta here.Karen也许不是社会支持的好选择So Karen may not be a good choice for social support.但是有很多人却是好的选择But there are many people who are.想想一个问题的力量Now think about the power of the question.想想一个问题带来的结果Think about what a question did.数十年间For decades,很多可以得到帮助的人没有得到many kids who potentially could have been helped weren't helped,因为没有提出正确的问题because the right question was not asked as well.只有在积极问题...And it was only after positive question,专注于积极的问题被提出来后the focusing on the positive question was asked心理学家们突然能够看到that suddenly psychologists were able to see数十年来一直都在眼前的东西what was right in front of them for decades.它就在那里 显而易见 等待着被发现It was right there,apparent evident,waiting to be discovered,但是他们完全忽略了but they completely missed it.他们聪明 动机良好 资金充足Smart,well-intentioned,well-funded,但是仍然没有提出正确的问题but also didn't ask the right question.问题制造现实 它们制造可能性Questions create reality. They create possibilities.一个问题引起一场探索A question begins a quest.他们在积极心理学方面的成就...What they did in positive psychology again,其中很大部分都是通过Antonovsky的努力a great deal through the work of Antonovsky was move us就是让我们从致病模型转到有益健康模型from the pathogenic model to the salutogenic model.健康本源学 健康的基础 起源Salutogenesis,the foundation,the origin of health.据Antonovsky所说And Antonovsky was talking about,研究疾病很重要he said that it's important to study illness,不管是精神疾病还是身体疾病mental illness,physical illness,但是研究健康的人也同样重要but it's equally important to study the healthy people,看看他们为什么会如此健康the healthy individuals to see how they make it,不管是否是哈佛大学里的人whether it's people at Harvard.哈佛大学是一个压力非常大的环境Harvard is a stressful environment.但是有些人却能走完它However,there are some people who are able to go through it,表现优秀 茁壮成长to do well,to thrive,flourish and--他们也经历起起伏伏well still going through the ups and downs,我们都是这样 但是总体上we all do-- overall experience it他们的经历更积极更快乐as a much more positive experience as a happy experience overall.他们是如何做到的?为什么?How do they do that? Why?Antonovsky说我们要研究这点Antonovsky said we need to study that这样我们就能了解健康的本源so that we understand the origin of health.他研究了这些东西And he studied these things而且它在该领域产生了很大影响and it made a big difference in the field as a whole.Antonovsky说"那些熟悉科学史的人"Quote Antonovsky: "All those familiar with the history of science"都知道重要的进步"are aware thatimportant advances come"伴随着新问题的形成而来"with the formulation of the new questions."问题才是突破点"The question is the breakthrough;"答案来之不易"the answer comes with difficulty,"但重要的是新问题"but it is the new question that is important."有益健康问题"The salutogenic question,"也就是我向你传播的"(正在发生)I submit to you,(that is what is working)"是一个极为新颖的问题"is a radically new question,"它推动新范式的形成"which provides the impetus for formulating a new paradigm"以帮助我们了解健康和疾病"to help us understand health and illness."它对研究人员和医生有着重要意义"It has serious implications for researcher and clinician,"生物学家和社会科学家也是如此"biological and social scientist alike."正是那个问题缔造了It was that question that essentially created the field of积极心理学和积极社会学positive psychology as well as positive sociology.他是训练有素的社会学家和其他领域的专家He was a sociologist by training as well as many other fields.问题导致改变Questions make a difference.问题缔造现实Questions create reality.现在我想和你们做一个练习I want to do an exercise with you now.我们在课堂上会做一些练习We'll do quite a few exercises in class.这是第一个Here's the first one.为了阐明问题的重要性To illustrate the importance of question,我要让你数几何图形的个数now I'm going to ask you to count the number of geometric shapes你在屏幕上看到多少个...that you see on the screen--不 不是这个屏幕no,not this screen,是下一个屏幕the next screen.你们是哈佛大学的学生 没问题的And you are Harvard students. It's fine.下一个屏幕The next screen,我要让你们数几何图形的个数I am going to ask you to count the number of geometric shapes你在屏幕上看到的 这是个非常难的问题that you see on the screen. It's a very difficult question.我把它给世界各地的人看过I've given it to people around the world.我让数学家和视觉艺术家看过I've given it to mathematicians,to artists who are very visual.这里的挑战是And the challenge here is you are only going to你只有30秒去看它have 30 seconds in which to do it,30秒之后告诉我你在屏幕上你看到了30 seconds to tell me how many geometric shapes多少个几何图形you see on the screen.准备好了吗?30秒Ready? 30 seconds.你看到屏幕上有多少个几何图形?How many geometric shapes do you see on the screen?开始Go.好的 31秒过去了Ok. So that's 31 seconds.应该没有问题了So there should be no problem.如果你没有做过...Now if you haven't done-我知道你们有些人做过这个练习I know a couple of you have done this exercise before,但是如果你以前没做过这个练习but if you haven't done- this exercise before,应该是大多数人-- and that's most of you,我希望你们能参与其中I'd like you to participate.你数出了屏幕上的多少个图形?So how many geometric shapes could you count on the screen?把数字说出来Throw out the numbers.6 8 48 58 44 36 110 6. 8. 48. 58. 44. 36. 110. 38.多少?How many?上面呢?Up there?你们的视角很好You have a good perspective.8 有多于110个的吗?8. Anyone more than 110?好的 多少?300?Yeah,how many? 300?200 有多于200个或少于6个的吗?200. Anyone more than 200 or less than 6?好的 很大的范围Ok. So quite a range.但是我承认这是个很难的问题But I grant you that it's a tough question.顺便说一下 如果你下载的PPT上By the way if you have it on your power points有这幅图...that you downloaded,后来我取消下载了I took it off on the later downloading,但是如果你下载了它but if you downloaded it,请现在不要看don't look at it now please.数到的个数在6个到200个之间So we have the rate between 6 and 200.这是一个很难的问题Now it's a tough question.实际上In fact,它难到我根本不知道有多少个几何图形it is so tough that I have no idea how many geometric shapes在屏幕上there are on the screen.但是我有另一个问题要问你们But I have another question for you.如果你知道这个问题的答案Now if you know the answer to this question,就把手举起来just put your hand up如果你以前没做过这个练习--and if you haven't done this exercise before,就把手举起来 别说出来-- just put your hand up. Don't shout it out.如果你知道答案 把手举起来If you know the answer,put your hand up:时钟上显示的是几点钟?what time was it on the clock?如果你知道答案就把手举起来If you know the answer,put your hand up.如果你认为你知道答案 举一半If you think you know the answer,half way up.也许知道 举四分之一Maybe maybe,quarter.剩下的可以离开了And the rest of you may leave now.有几个举了一半 所以在整个教室里Ok,so we have a few halves. So out of the room,这里有多少...这里大概有六七百个学生--how many were there-- probably 600,700 students here,在七百个哈佛学生里out of 700 Harvard students,五个半人能看到时钟上的时间five and a half people can read the time on the clock.但是我知道 我们今天都有电子表But I understand,we all have digital watches today.这很困难It's difficult.我来问你们另一个较容易的问题So let me ask you an easier question.如果你知道答案就把手举起来If you know the answer,just put your hand up.没错That's right!你看到巴士上有多少个小孩?How many kids were visible on the bus?如果你知道答案 把手举起来If you know the answer,put your hand up.如果你觉得你知道 举一半If you think you know,half way up.也许知道 举四分之一Maybe,quarter.大多数人都在想"什么巴士?"Yeah,most of you think,"what bus?!""什么小孩?"You know. "What kids?"就在那里Well it was there.整个教室里的七百个哈佛学生So out of a room of --again -- 700 Harvard students,大概有11.75人数出来了there are approximately 11 and 3/4. Who can count?但那没关系But that's Ok.这不是55号数学课程That's not my 55 (Math 55 course in Harvard) here.我明白I understand.另一个问题Another question.它比较容易A little bit easier.屏幕上最左边的几何图形What was the color of,the dominant color of它的主要颜色是什么?the left-most geometric shape on the screen?不是较大的那个图形Not the big one on screen,而是屏幕上最左边的几何图形but the left-most geometric shape on the screen.主要颜色是什么?What was the dominant color?如果你知道答案 把手举起来If you know the answer,hand right up.如果觉得自己知道 举一半If you think you know,half way.好的 大概是12.25人Ok. So that's about 12 1/4 people.根据我的估计研究According to my estimated research,这个教室里大概有五到七人there are probably between 5 and 7 people in this room是色盲的who are color blind.真的 根据统计资料Really-- according to the statistics.其余的人则没有借口说看不清The rest of you have no excuse.我们来看看Let's look.时钟上显示的时间?So the time on the clock?有谁觉得很难看清时间吗?Someone difficult to obscure the time?十点十分10:10.这是有点难Well it's a bit difficult.可以看见车上有多少个小孩?Visible children on the bus?汽车在这里 有些人还是看不见Here's the bus,for those of you still can't see it.五个 还有颜色5. And the color.最左边几何图形的主要颜色?The dominant color of the geometric shape?855黄色Yellow.怎么回事?What happened?这是说 这些并不是非常难的问题I mean these are not very difficult questions.就算是积极心理学的期末考Even the final of positive psychology都要比它难is going to be difficult than that.真的 难很多I mean,really. A lot more.为什么?Why?862原因是 我问了你们某个特定的问题Well the reason is I asked you a certain question,那个问题让你注意现实的某一部分and that question directed you to a certain part of reality.00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:47,240这是件好事And that's a good thing.因为如果我们总是专注于一切事情Because if we were focusing on everything all the time,那就不是件好事that wouldn't be a good thing.每种噪音都会让我们分心We would be distracted by every single noise,所有物体运动都会让我们分心by every single movement.所以我们能集中注意力是件好事So it's a good thing that we can focus.但是 我们也要记得However,we also need to remember这种集中精神的能力带来的后果the consequences of this ability to focus却不总是好事或者有益的that is not always good it's not always helpful.因为在你们看来Because as far as you were concerned,巴士上没有小孩there were no children on the bus.在你们看来As far as you were concerned,上面只有几何图形there were only geometric shapes.换句话说 我的问题给你们大多数人In other words,my question,for most of you,制造了一种特定的现实created a very specific reality,一种只有几何图形a reality which there were geometric shapes巴士上没有小孩的现实and no children on the bus.这有着非常重要的含义Now that has very important implications.想想以下的问题 蜜月期过后Think about the following question: what question is mostly asked夫妻间问的最多的问题是什么?by couples beyond the honeymoon phase?他们度过蜜月期之后so they go through the honeymoon phase不管是一个月 一年还是两年whether it's a month,a year or sometimes two years.那段时期后他们会开始问什么问题?What questions do they begin to ask after that period of time?"怎么回事?有什么问题?""What's wrong? What's not working?"我们怎样去改善关系?'How can we improve the relationship?"这是一个非常重要的问题Now that's a very important question to ask.非常重要Very important.但如果这是我们所问的But if that's the only question唯一一些问题or the only questions that we ask,那么我们看到的也只有这件事then that is the only thing we will see.我们能看到的只是我们的不足The only things that we will see are our deficiencies,出了差错的事情the things that are not working,需要去改善的事情the things that need to be improved,我伴侣的缺点the weaknesses of my partner,我们关系的缺点of the relationship.如果我只是问"什么出了差错"If the only questions that I ask are "what is not working","怎么回事 我要改善什么" 重申一次"what's wrong","what do I need to improve"-- and again,我们不需要去掉这些问题these are not questions we need to do away with,它们很重要 但如果它们是唯一的问题they are important. However if they are the only questions,而通常它们确实是and usually they are the only questions被提出或主要提出的问题that are asked or primarily asked,那么在这对夫妇看来 不是客观上then as far as the couple is concerned,not objectively,在这对夫妇看来but as far as the couple is concerned,他们的关系里没有好的事物good things do not exist in the relationship.就像在你们看来Just like as far as you are concerned,巴士上没有小孩there were no children on the bus,虽然他们就在你们面前even though they were right there in front of you,盯着你staring at you.但是他们不存在But they do not exist.或者从个人的角度思考它Or think about it at an individual level.这非常重要This is very important.我们问得最多的问题...What is the question that we,大多数美国人 澳大利亚人 中国人most Americans,most Australians,most Chinese,以色列人 欧洲人 非洲人most Israelis,most Europeans,Africans--大多数人最经常问自己的是什么问题?what is the question that is mostly asked about the self?我之所以要提到那些地方And the reason why I mentioned all these places是因为这是跨文化的研究is because this is cross-cultural study.大多数人都会问自己People mostly ask themselves,我的弱点是什么?我要改善什么?"what are my weaknesses? What do I need to improve?"通常排除了Very often to the exclusion of我的长处是什么?我擅长于什么?"what are my strengths? What are my virtues? What am I good at?"如果我们问自己的And if the only question唯一问题是that we ask ourselves are the only questions that are我的缺点 我的不足是什么?"what are my weaknesses? Deficiencies?",那么我们能看到的then the only thing we'll see in ourselves只有自己的缺点和不足are weaknesses and deficiencies.在我们看来And as far as we are concerned,好的东西 我们的长处 热情 美德the good things-- our strengths,our passions,our virtues--我们身上的美好事物并不存在the wonderful things within us do not exist.就像在你们看来Just like as far as you are concerned,巴士上的小孩并不存在the children on the bus did not exist.现在我问你们Now I ask you,一个主要关注缺点的人could a person who only or primarily focuses on weaknesses看不到and does not see,也不欣赏他们的长处 热情does not appreciate their strength,their passions,他们的美德的人their virtues--一个这样的人会有很高的自尊心can a person like that experience high levels of self-respect,自信心和很多的快乐吗?self-confidence,happiness?我们还奇怪 为什么这么多婚姻会失败?And we wonder,why do so many relationships fail?我们还奇怪 为什么抑郁 焦虑And we wonder,why depression,anxiety以及自尊心低落的情况增加了这么多?and low self-esteem are increasing so much?00:51:52,430 --> 00:51:53,990动机是有的The intentions are there.它们都是好的动机 我们问的是They are good. We are asking"我们如何改善?怎样才能做得更好?""How can we improve? What can we do better?"但如果我们不问积极的问题But if we don't also ask the positive question,在我们看来那部分现实并不存在that part of reality will not exist as far as we are concerned.就像数十年来对那些心理学家一样Just like for the psychologists for decade,他们问题的答案 问题的解决方案the answer to their questions,the solution to the problem并不存在that they wanted to solve did not exist,即使它就在那里even though it is right there,在他们的眼前 在那些成功孩子的身上in front of their very eyes within the successful kids,在他们的心理弹性里within their resilience.问题缔造现实Questions create reality.我们所问的问题通常决定了The questions we ask very often determine我们追求的东西the quest that we will pursue,我们会走的道路the path that we will take,我们会过的生活the life that we will lead,不管是从个人方面来说whether it's individually,从人际关系方面来说whether it's interpersonally,从组织方面来说都是这样whether it's organizationally.什么问题...What is the question?我知道你们很多会要当心理辅导师Many of you I know are going into consulting.心理辅导师最经常问的问题是什么?What's the question that most consultants ask,不管他们是否说出来Either explicit question or implicit question,他们首次见到客户问的问题是什么?the first time when they meet a client?"有什么问题?有什么需要改善的?"--"What's wrong? What can we improve?"有什么缺点需要改正?"What are the weaknesses that we need to strengthen them?"再说一次 它们是很重要的问题Again,important questions to ask.但如果你只问这些问题But if you only ask these questions,那么你就忽视了这个机构的then you are ignoring the strengths,优势以及美德the virtues of the organization.你所做的只是在让他们失去活力And what you are doing,you are enervating,你在让公司慢慢地变弱you are weakening the organization over time.欣赏起作用的东西It is as important,if not more important,也同样重要 如果不是更重要的话to also appreciate what is working,不管是在机构里 人际关系里或个人方面organizationally,interpersonally,as well as individually.欣赏好的事物非常重要It is important to appreciate what is good.看看"Appreciate"这个词I mean,look at the word,"appreciate".它有两个意思 其一就是为某事感激Two meanings: first meaning-- to say thank you for something,而不是认为某事理所当然not to take it for granted.这样做很好And that's a nice thing to do.我们不应该把长处 成功看作理所当然We shouldn't take for granted our virtues,our successes.我们不应把别人看作理所当然We shouldn't take for granted others.这是很好的事情That's a nice thing to do.但是"Appreciate"还有一个意思就是增值But appreciate has a second meaning,which is to grow.钱在银行里会增值Money appreciates in the bank.经济会增长The economy hopefully appreciates.当我们感激好的东西When we appreciate the good,好的东西便会增值 它会增长the good appreciates-- the good grows.不幸的是 反过来也是成立的Unfortunately,the other side of the same coin applies as well.当我们不感激好的东西When we don't appreciate the good,把它看作理所当然 好的东西会贬值when we take it for granted,the good depreciates.那就是大多数婚姻And that's what happens in most relationships蜜月期后发生的情况after the honeymoon phase.那就是发生在多数人身上的情况That's what happens to most people,特别是对于那些有动力去提高especially to very driven people who want to improve,想变得更好的人who want to get better.那是件好事And that's good thing,如果那让你感到开心的话if that is what makes you happy.同时At the same time,欣赏自己的优点也同样重要it's equally important to also appreciate what is good inside me我的长处 优点是什么what my strengths,what my virtues are.我们在课堂中将经常练习这点And we are going to do a lot of that in the course.但是不会做到自我陶醉的程度And again,not to go to the point of narcissism.我们会谈到自我陶醉If anything narcissism-- and we'll talk about it就在本学期倒数第二节课in the second last lecture in the semester-自我陶醉不是自信 不是自尊narcissism is not about self-confidence,about self-esteem.它正好相反It's exactly the opposite.我们说的是有根据的自信We are talking about grounded self-confidence.有根据的大方有益的快乐Grounded,generous,benevolent happiness.为了过上那种生活In order to lead that kind of life,我们还要欣赏起作用的东西we need to also appreciate what is working,用比喻的意义上说 还要留意巴士上的小孩to also focus on,metaphorically speaking,the children on a bus.Stavros和Torres在一本关于婚姻的好书里说Stavros and Torres in the wonderful book on relationships,"我们会看到要寻找的东西""We see what we look for and we miss much of"错失不去寻找的东西 虽然它在那里"what we are not looking for even though it is there."我们的阅历"Our experience of the world is heavily influenced"被我们的关注点深深地影响了"by where we place our attention."问题经常会缔造现实Questions very often create reality.理解什么是问题的首要事情The first important thing to understand about questions就是我们要理解那些问题is that we need to understand the questions.在这点我同意一位重要哲学家And here I want to defer to a very important philosopher,一位20世纪和21世纪的哲学家a 20th and 21st century philosopher,他阐明了理解问题的重要性who illustrates the importance of understanding questions--荷马辛普森Homer Simpson.能不能把声音调低一点If you can just turn down the voice,the sound a little bit,因为它非常大声 谢谢because this is very loud. Thank you.辛普森一家The Simpsons现在我们要做几项测试SCULLY: Now we're gonna run a few tests.这是一台简单的测谎仪This is a simple lie detector.我会问你几个问题 你回答是或否I'll ask you a few yes or no questions你要老实回答and you just answer truthfully.明白吗?Do you understand?明白HOMER: Yes.很精彩Love it. Love it.所以第一步是真正理解问题So the first step is really understanding the question.但是我们理解问题之后But once we understand it,知道我们要问什么问题也很重要it is also important to know what questions are we going to ask.我之前提到过培养心理弹性的要事之一I mentioned earlier that one of the most important things就是要有一个榜样in cultivating resilience is having a role model.现在我要告诉你们我的榜样I want to share with you now my role model,实际上 正是因为她in fact,the person who is the reason我才决定成为一名教师why I decided to become a teacher.她叫Marva CollinsHer name is Marva Collins.Marva Collins20世纪30年代生于阿拉巴马州Marva Collins was born in Alabama in the 1930s.她父亲是非洲裔美国人 母亲是印地安人Her father was African American; her mother,Native American.她出生的时候she was born at a time in a place种族岐视风行where there was a great deal of discrimination.幸运的是 对于MarvaFortunately,for Marva,她父亲对她非常有信心her father really believed in her从小他就对她说and said to her from a very young age,"Marva 你将会有所作为""Marva,you can make something of your life."你可以成为一名秘书"You can become a secretary."他之说以说秘书是因为Now the reason why he said secretary is because那就是无形的障碍that was where the glass ceiling,或者说是有形的障碍or rather concrete ceiling exists鉴于她的种族背景for a person of her ethnic background,鉴于她的性别a person of her gender.Marva Collins努力工作Marva Collins worked hard.她很聪明 她成功了She was smart. She succeeded. She made it.她成为了一名秘书And she became a secretary.做了几年秘书之后 虽然干得不错After a few years of working as a secretary,doing well,她觉得这不适合她 不是她的使命she decided this was not for her and what her calling in life.她真正的热情在于教书Her real passion was in teaching.她想成为学校里的一名教师She wanted to be a school teacher.于是她上夜校She went to night school.几年之后A few years later,她得到了教师证书she got her teaching certificate,她结婚了并和丈夫搬到了芝加哥got married and with her husband moved to Chicago.她在那加入了芝加哥内城的公立学校There she joined the public school system in inner city,Chicago.她在那里看到的现实The reality that she found,是大量犯罪that she encountered there was a reality of much crime,毒品泛滥 最重要的是没有希望much drugs and more than anything,hopelessness.老师们的希望是让孩子们The hope of the teachers was to keep the students in school在学校里尽可能呆久点for as long as possible.为什么?因为这样他们就不会12岁加入街头帮派Why? --So that they don't join the street gangs at the age of 12;这样他们就不会接触毒品 不会犯罪so that they are protected from the drugs,from crime."我们怎样让学生呆在学校里?""How can we keep the students in school for as long as possible?"老师们问asked the teachers.Marva Collins面对这种现实说Marva Collins walks into this reality and says,"事情将有所改观""Things are going to be different."在上课的第一天...On the first day of class,她教一年级到四年级-- she teaches first graders to fourth graders--在上课的第一天--on the first day of class,她对学生们说she says to her students,"我们要练习自信""We are going to do a lot of believing in ourselves."她不断地重复地说着这则信息And she repeats this message over and over and over again,整个学期犹如不断重播的唱片like a broken record throughout the semester最后坚持了整年 几年and the year and years."我相信你 你能做好 你能成功""I believe in you. You can do well. You can succeed."承担生活的责任"Take responsibility for your life."停止抱怨 停止抱怨政府"Stop blaming. Stop blaming the government."停止抱怨老师 停止抱怨父母"Stop blaming your teachers. Stop blaming your parents."成功与否全在你自己"It is up to you to succeed."00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:03,她继续不断地重复着这则信息And she continues with this message over and over and over again.她对学生们充满期望Having really high expectations of her students,把眼光放在他们的长处looking at what they are good at,和优点上 并而加以培养their strength and cultivating those.奇迹开始发生了Miracles begin to happen. These students,这些被老师认为是"不可教"的学生considered by many of the teachers to be"unteachable"-到了四年级便可以读these "unteachable" ones by the time that they are in欧里庇得斯 爱默生和莎翁的作品fourth grade are reading Euripides,Emerson and Shakespeare.这些"不可教"的学生在十岁时These "unteachable" ones at the age of 便可以做高中的数学are doing high school mathematics.关于Marva Collins的谣言开始传播Now rumor begins to spread about Marva Collins,她怎能让这些学生在教室里呆这么长时间because how can she keep these students in class for so long,而其他学生却想着离开学校?when all the other students are just trying to get out of school?她一定是在强迫他们She must be using force.Marva Collins受够了谣言的中伤And Marva Collins has enough of these rumors,她离开公共学校成立了自己的学校leave the public school system,opens up her own school就在她的厨房里 开始只有四个学生in her own kitchen with 4 students and initially,其中两个是她的孩子two of them her own kids.逐渐地 越来越多的学生进入了Marva Collins学校Gradually,more and more students join the Marva Collins school,她称之为西岸小学Westside preparatory she calls it.一开始进入这间学校的学生All the students that initially joined the school都是从公共学校退学的are public school dropouts.Marva Collins是他们成为街头混混前最后的希望Marva Collins is the last resort before the street.奇迹继续发生And the miracles continue.逐渐地 越来越多的学生进入Gradually more and more students come in.她不得不搬出去She has to move out of her home.他们在芝加哥租了一间小室They wretchedly rent a small shack in Chicago place,冬天寒冷无比 夏天酷热难当freezing in winter,scorching hot in summer.然而学生们被他们的热情所驱动And yet the students are driven by their passion.他们继续学习 奇迹继续发生在他们身上And they continue. Miracles continue to happen to them.Marva Collins所有的学生Every one of Marva Collins' students graduates都从小学毕业了from elementary school.所有学生都上了高中并毕业了Everyone goes to high school and graduates from high school.她所有的学生最后都上了大学Every one of her students ends up in college并从大学毕业and graduates from college.没错 那些"不可教"的学生Yes,those "unteachable" ones.Marva Collins数十年生活困苦Marva Collins lives in a dire poverty for decades,然而她努力平衡收支somehow making ends meet.毕竟 她的学生都无法付学费After all,most of her students can't pay.但是 月继一月 她熬过去了But somehow,months to months,she makes it.1979年 情况一夜发生了变化1979 it changes overnight.CBS《60分钟》的制片人A producer,from the television CBS program "60 Minutes" finds得知了Marva Collins的故事 并制作了15分钟的节目out about Marva Collins and creates a 15 minutes segment on her.她一夜成名Overnight she becomse famous.1980年11月November,1980,新当选总统罗纳德里根打电话给Marva Collinsnew President elect Ronald Reagan calls up Marva Collins.请她做他的教育部长offers her to be his secretary of Education.我想她父亲是对的So I guess her father was right.Marva Collins拒绝了邀请 她说Marva Collins turns his offers down and says,"我太喜欢教书了 我属于教室""I love to teach too much. My place is in the classroom.恰好八年过去了8 years later almost to the day,新当选总统老布什new president elect George Bush Sr.再次打电话给Marva Collinscalls Marva Collins once again,请她做他的教育部长offering her to be his secretary of education.再一次 她说"我太喜欢教书了"Once again,"I love to teach too much.""我属于教室"My place is in the classroom.1995年 一位富裕的慈善家捐赠了In 1995,a wealthy philanthropist donates tens of millions数千万美元给Marva Collinsof dollars to Marva Collins.现在全国都有Marva Collins学校Now there are Marva Collins schools all over the country数千名学生在里面学习where thousands of students learn,来自世界各地的数百名教师where hundreds of teachers from all over the world前来目睹Marva Collins的奇迹come and see the miracle of Marva Collins.今天Marva Collins的学生里有政治家Today there are Marva Collins graduates who are politicians,商人 律师 医生business people,lawyers,doctors,而最多的 就是老师and more than anything,teachers.因为他们知道他们老师的功劳Because they know what their teacher has done for them.我要展示这位杰出女性的一个片段I want to show you a brief excerpt of this extraordinary woman.请把声音调大一点You can turn the volume up a little bit please.它声音不大This is soft.Marva Collins"积极学习法"Marva Collins "Positive Learning"我想我做得很好I think I did pretty wonderful.我想我很聪明 我很特别I think I'm bright. I think I am unique.我会教每个孩子这样想And I'll teach every child of me to think that.当他们不守规矩的时候When they misbehave,他们的惩罚就是要写100个原因their punishment is they have to write 100 reasons说明为什么他们棒到要做那样的事why they are too wonderful to do what they are doing.而且它们要按字母顺序写And they have to be alpha order.我很可爱 我很漂亮 我很勇敢I am adorable. I am beautiful. I am courageous.我给他们例子直到他们明白I give them the first ones until they get the hang out of it.我令人快乐 我很兴奋 我很厉害I am delightful. I am effervescent. I am fabulous.我很棒 我是榜样 我无与伦比I am heavenly. I am idolized. I am just wonderful.我很热情 我很可爱 我很重要I am a kindred spirit. I am lovable. I am momentous.我从不懒惰I am never,never indolent.一直写到最后一个字母 如果他们再犯And it goes on to z. And if they do it again,他们必须要用另一个同义词then they have to use another synonym.他们不能再用可爱了They can't use adorable any more.现在孩子们会对新学生说Now the children will say to a new student,我知道你为什么不再不守规矩了I know why you don't behave.因为我厌倦告诉Ms. Collins我有多棒了Coz I'm tired of telling Ms. Collins how wonderful I am.她非常棒Now she is wonderful.这是她的书Here is her book.对于那些...我知道Now for all those-- I know that你们中有些人对教书有兴趣there are quite a few of you who are interested in teaching,如果有一本你要读的书 就是这本and there's one book you want to read. It's this.对于那些对做领导有兴趣的人For all those of you who are interested in leadership如果有一本你要读的书 就是这本and there's one book you want to read. It's this.对于那些已经是或以后想做父母的人For all those of you who are or are interested in the future如果有一本你要读的书of becoming parents,and there's one book you want to read.就是这本It's this.对于剩下的人For all the rest of you,如果有一本你要读的书...if there's one book you want to read.她传递的信息是什么?So what's her message?首先First of all,她本身就是榜样she herself is the message as a role model.她和孩子们学习榜样And she studied with her kids,role models.他们读小说 历史书They read fiction books. They read historical books.他们读关于英雄的书 谈论英雄的事They read books about heroes and talk about heroes.他们都认清了谁是榜样They all identify role models.他们从社区里挑出榜样They identify role models in their neighborhood,在家庭里挑出榜样 不断地这样做in their families,constantly doing that,这就是你培养心理弹性要做的事which is exactly what you need to cultivate resilience.首先 她就是榜样First and foremost,she herself is the role model.她有着很高的期望She has high expectations.我们要大量练习自信We are going to do a lot of believing in ourselves.我们要表现优秀 我们要成功We are going to do well,succeed.她有很多期待 她能看到潜力She expects a lot.She sees the potential.01:06:58,580 --> 01:07:02,730她欣赏每个人的潜力She appreciates that potential in each individual.停止抱怨别人 承担自己生活的责任Stop blaming others. Take responsibility for your life.Marva Collins并不是软弱的人Marva Collins is no push-over.教室里的她要求很严格If you see her in the classroom,she is tough. She is demanding.同时 她尊重每个人At the same time,she respects each individual.她不是不切实际的"感觉良好"She is not one of the Pollyannish "feel-good",我们不惜一切代价让他们感觉良好"let's make them all feel good" at all cost.根本不是Not at all.她相信他们 她尊重他们She believes in them.She respects them.而且她要求很严格And she is tough and demanding--这是领导的重要因素important combination for leadership.这就是为什么我之前提到It's why I mentioned earlier它是一本好的领导书籍in the context of great leadership book.有很多非常和善的前总裁There are many very nice ex-CEOs他们的主要目标就是和善和受欢迎whose primary aim was to be nice and to be liked,完成工作的关键the keys to get the job done,完成事情的关键to get the work done,同时也要尊重他人while being respectful.她有乐观精神Sense of optimism.你可以做好You can do well.你会做得很好You are going to do well,帮助他们为自己和社区设立目标helping them set goals for themselves and for community.最后And finally,从专注缺点到专注优点from focusing on deficiencies to focusing on strength.来自教育学校的Howard GardnerHoward Gardner from the ED(Education) school here talks about谈到了多元智力 他说我们要停止问multiple intelligences,says that we need to stop asking一个学生是否聪明whether or not a student is smart.我们要问这个学生有什么优点What we need to ask is what is the student smart at.认清这个学生的优点And when we identify what that student is smart at,长处之后 我们便欣赏它strong at,virtuous at,good at,then we appreciate it.当我们欣赏它的时候And when we appreciate it,优点和那整个人都会增值it and the whole person appreciates.假如有一粒种子...种子是有潜力的What would happen to a seed-- seed is potential--它会长成花草树木...假如有一粒种子flower,tree-- what would happen to a seed,如果它没有受到灌溉 没有阳光照耀会怎样?if it is not watered,if no light is shed on it?它会枯萎死去It will wither and die.01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:54,860人类的潜力也是这样The exact same thing with human potential.如果我们不灌溉它 如果我们不照耀它If we don't water it,if we don't shed a light on it,它会枯萎死去it will wither and die.人际关系也是这样The same with interpersonal relationship potential.如果我们...我们会经常谈到关系If we don't-- we'll talk a lot about relationships:如何培养健康长期的关系how to cultivate healthy long-term relationships--如果你不灌溉它 不照耀它if you don't water it,if you don't shed light,如果你不欣赏它的好处 好处就会贬值if you don't appreciate the good,the good will depreciate.本质上Essentially,Marva Collins所做的what Marva Collins does is create for students--也就是心理弹性的作用就是what the research in resilience does is缔造一个与传统智慧不同的榜样create a very different model than the conventional wisdom.范式转移实质上是从被动接受者...The paradigm shift essentially is from being a passive victim也就是政府没有投入足够资金because the government is not putting enough money,这是一个问题 应该重视which is an issue,not belittling it.用外部条件 比如资源It's important to have those external影响内在性格很重要affect the internal like more resources.但那并不足够But that's not enough.从一个不积极 被动的受害者From an inactive,from a passive victim,成为一个主动的人 她改变了看法she changes her perspective to be an active agent.你并非"不可教"You are not "unteachable".你可以发展 你可以做好 你可以成功You can thrive. You can do well.You can succeed.而她所做的实质上And what she does,essentially,就是把他们带到连续体的极点is take them to the extreme of continuum,because every event,因为每件事每个人都处于连续体的某处every person can be situated somewhere along this continuum,我是说 不同的地方和不同的事物I mean different places with different things.想想你自己的生活Think about your own life.你是哪种人?What are you,各种情况的被动受害者还是主动者?passive victim in different situations or an active agent?例如 假如说我女朋友离开了我For example,let's say my girlfriend leaves me.当我还是这里的学生的时候I know when I was an undergrad here.我主要想的是 我女朋友要离开我了This was top on my mind: girlfriends leaving me.是的Yes.那点我们以后再谈We'll talk about that later in this semester当我们熟悉彼此之后when we get to know one another a little bit better.现在我有点害羞I'm a little bit shy at this point.但是假如我女朋友离开了我But let's say my girlfriend leaves me.如果我是被动受害者 那我只会自怜If I am the passive victim,what I experience is self-pity.为自己感到难过 思考Feel sorry for myself. ruminate-- remember the word?思考这种情况以及它有多糟糕Ruminate about the situation and how terrible it is.我从一个被动受害者变成抱怨者她很糟糕From a passive victim,I then move to blame: she's terrible;都是她的错 我怨她it's her fault; I blame her;我抱怨我的父母 他们养育不当I blame my parents,the way they raise me;我抱怨她的父母 我抱怨布什总统I blame her parents; I blame President Bush or whomever.抱怨之后 我变得沮丧和愤怒And after I blame,I experience frustration as well as anger.对她生气 对我父母生气 对她父母生气Anger toward her,toward my parents,her parents,布什总统 希拉里 总之我很愤怒President Bush,Hilary,whoever it is. I feel anger.结果呢 很少结果And results-- very few results.因为我沉迷于反思和自怜中Because I wallow in illumination and self-pity.我们再反观积极主动者Let's take the other extreme of the active agent.首先 从定义来看 我会行动First of all,by definition,I take action.我承担责任I take responsibility.经历痛苦之后我会到处走走I go on to places after experiencing the pain--它很痛苦 下节课我们会谈谈it's painful,and next time we are going to talk about经历痛苦的重要性the importance of experiencing the pain of giving ourselves谈谈允许自己人性化what I called the permission to be human,但是我经历痛苦之后 我会行动but once I experience it,I take action.我去能认识他人的地方I go out there to places where I will meet someone.我去匹诺曹(哈佛的比萨店)I go to Pinnochio's (Pizza place at Harvard).或者另一个约会地点Or another meeting place,the Stax in Whitener (?).我想时世变迁了Well I guess things have changed现在的哈佛和我毕业时的不同了at Harvard since I was an undergrad.我承担责任I take responsibility for it.这样做的结果是...And then as a result of that--我们会谈谈自我知觉理论and we'll talk about research on self-perception theory,它是Daryl Bem的研究research by Daryl Bem.我们会详细讨论它 你不用现在把它写下来We'll talk a lot about it. You don't need to write it down now.我会行动 行动会增加我们的自信I'll take action and action will increase our level of confidence结果是更多的希望和乐观And then more hope and optimism is a result.就像在自我应验预言课程中所说的As we talk about belief in self-fulfilling prophecy lecture,希望和乐观会变成自我应验预言hope and optimism become a self-fulfilling prophecy.我更容易找到伴侣I'm much more likely to find someone.我更可能变得开心I'm certainly much more likely to be happy.重申一次 作为积极主动者Once again,being an active agent并不意味着不给我们自己时间does not mean not giving ourselves the time,空间去让自己感受痛苦的情感the space,the permission to experience painful emotions,以及摆脱这种情感to go through the emotion.没错 我们一定会摆脱它 然而Yes,by all means,we go through it. However,我们要在适合的时间...what it is also saying is that we need to find the right time--它可能是现在 可能是一两天后it could be immediately,it could be a day or two later--去行动 去承担责任 去做事情 这样to take action,to take responsibility,to do things so that我们对希望和乐观的自信就会增加our confidence levels in our hope and optimism increase.我要说几件关于I want to just say a few things about this idea做一个积极主动者及责任的事of being an active agent and responsibility.它可以融入你的哈佛生活 这取决于你It applies to your life here at Harvard. It is up to you.让你的哈佛时光充满意义It is your responsibility to make the most out of是你的责任your Harvard experiences.从这门课程学尽量多的东西是你的责任It is your responsibility to make the most out of this class.我们作为教师We,the teaching staff,肯定会为它创造条件are certainly going to create conditions for it.我们会以各种方式支持你们We are going to support you in every way that you need.然而 最终However,ultimately,小组讨论是你们的责任it's your responsibility to do it in section.作出行动是你们的责任It's your responsibility to make it.下周你们在小组里One of the first questions that you'll be asking question首先要问的问题之一就是in section next week when they start to meet is"你如何让它成为一个优秀的小组?""how can you make this an excellent section?""你能做什么? 你能有什么贡献?""What can you do?" "what can you bring?"你能给小组带来什么优势"What strength can you bring into the section"让它成为一个优秀的小组?"so that it's an excellent section?"而不是抱怨其他学生 组长 布什 克林顿As opposed to blaming,other students,TF,Bush,Clinton,whoever你要为它承担责任Taking responsibility for it.关于责任 有一个很好的故事There is a wonderful story about responsibilityNathaniel Branden的书里提到了in the book by Nathaniel Branden.1354当我们谈到自尊时We are going to read some stuff by Nathaniel Branden我们要读点Nathaniel Branden的东西when we talk about self-esteem.Nathaniel Branden谈到了六根支柱Nathaniel Branden talks about six pillars自尊的六根重要支柱six important pillars in self-esteem.其中一根就是自我负责One of those pillars is self-responsibility.自尊心强的人会承担责任People who have high self-esteem take responsibility.想培养高自尊心People who want to cultivate high self-esteem培养自信的人会承担责任and create confidence,take responsibility承担生活的责任等等for their lives and so on.在他的研讨会上 他在书中说到的So in his workshop,one of the main things that he says主要一件事就是 明白你必须there in his book is that understanding that you have to为生活承担责任就是理解take responsibility for your life is recognizing understanding没人会来that no one is coming.1367没人会来...穿着闪亮铠甲的骑士No one is coming to-- the knight in shining armour不会来带你到幸福乐园who will take you to the happily-ever-after land.没人会来让你的生活更美好No one is coming to make your life better for you.没人会来No one is coming.你为自己的生活负责 获得自信You are responsible for your life,for your self-confidence,自尊 幸福for your self-esteem,for your happiness.没人会来No one is coming.他在研讨会上谈到了这个So he was talking about this in one of his workshops那是一个为期三天的研讨会that's a three-day workshop.这已经是第三天了And this was already on the third day研讨会进展顺利and the workshop was going well.参与者都学到了很多The participants were getting a lot out of it.他说 他告诉他们没人会来And he said,he told them about this idea that no one is coming.其中一名参与者举手说And one of the participants raises his hand and says,"Branden博士 事实并非这样""Dr. Branden,that's not true."Nathaniel Branden问他"为什么?" 他说And Nathaniel Branden asks him,"What do you mean?" And he says,"Branden博士 你来了" Branden回应道"Dr. Branden,you came",to which Branden responded,"没错 我来了 但我是来告诉你没人会来""Yes,I came. But I came to tell you that no one is coming."没人会来No one is coming.能否最大限度地从这次经历中获益全在于你It's up to you to make the most out of this experience,1504号课程 你的小组 你的哈佛经历等等1504,your sections,your Harvard experiences and beyond.我们作为教师And we,as the teaching staff,我们迫不及待想为之创造适合条件can't wait to create the right conditions for that to happen.星期四再见See you on Thursday.
