幸福课 中英字幕 [第4课]积极的环境能改变人
Hi everybody.
We are the Harvard Callbacks
We have a special Valentine's Day message
dedicated from the teaching staff to the students.
I will never find another lover sweeter than you,
sweeter than you
I will never find another lover more precious than you,
more precious than you Coz you are Close to me you're like my mother,
Close to me you're like my father,
Close to me you're like my sister,
Close to me you're like my brother
You are the only one my everything
and for you this song I sing All my life
I pray for someone like you I thank God that I,
that I finally found you
And I pray that you do love me too Pray
that you do love me too
Happy Valentine's Day!
Hi, morning.
You know, when I asked them to dedicate this song,
I had a slightly different song in mind.
But-- so be it.
We do love you.
What we are going to talk about today,
continuing from last time
is or are the basic premises of this course--
where we are coming from, where we are going--
laying down in many ways,
the foundation of the spiral that
we are going to create for the next semester together.
Last time we stopped, we talked about how difficult change is.
We talked about the Twin studies that illustrate
that what Lykken and Tellegen said--
maybe changing our happiness level is as difficult as--
and futile-- as trying to change our height.
And we talked about the error of the average and the mistake
that these researchers are making,
misunderstanding the nature of change.
Because if someone changes,
the question is no longer "is it possible to change"
but rather "how is it possible to change".
And then we talked about the Somerville Cambridge study
that show that literally the Rolls-Royce of interventions failed--
5 years with the leading scientists,
researchers, psychiatrists,
psychologists from Cambridge, Harvard and MIT,
putting their minds and hearts for good intentions
to bring about change-- failure.
Not only they have failed in bringing about positive change,
they actually brought about negative change.
Remember?-- Alcoholism rates went up for the intervention group,
compared to the control group.
The control group that joined no intervention actually
were more luckily to advance in their workplace 20, 30 years later.
So change is difficult,
but then we went over and said,
"Well, Marva Collins creates change.
So it is possible.
Programs by Martin Seligmen and Karen Reivich
and numerous others succeeding in bringing about change".
And the challenge then is,
for us, if our goal is to become practical idealists
is to understand what it is that brings about change and then do it.
Spread the word.
Spread the word about the research.
Even if the research doesn't always communicate good news,
it's about communicating what works,
what is real, as opposed to our dreams ,
our desires, our hopes, our wishes--
that's not enough.
Good will, idealism, good intentions are not enough.
We need to be grounded in research.
And this is very much what Maslow has in mind
when he talked about the analogous Manhattan Project,
where scientists, positive psychologists or that time psychologists,
social scientists would get together
and pick out the tip of the stem--
the few ideas,
the few programs that work and then replicate them.
Study the best and as one of the students here, Mariam --
came to me after the class and she said,
"the tip of the stem is actually about democratizing excellence."
I love that phrase.
Democratizing excellence--
studying the best and applying it to the rest of us.
Ok, so we have this grand scheme,
grand idea by Maslow to create a Manhattan-type Project.
But what if I'm not interested in going into one of these projects?
What if I'm not even interested in becoming an academic?
Just want to do things on my own: Can I make a difference?
And the answer is absolutely yes.
One of the most significant barriers
to people doing things in the world,
to actually introducing change
is that they underestimate their ability to bring about change.
There is a lot of research in psychology.
Primarily the people who started are Emerson and Moscovici
and many others who have done research showing how minority--
very often one person can make a big difference,
can make a significant difference.
Ralph Waldo Emerson:
"All history is a record of the power of minorities,
and of minorities of one,
"-- a lot to backed that up in social science research.
Margaret Mead, the anthropologist:
"Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful,
committed citizens can change the world.
Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has."
All change begins in the mind of single person or a small group."
And then it expands.
Now the question is "how does it expand"
and "why is it so difficult for us to understand,
accept, assimilate and live according to the fact
that we can make a difference,
if we understand that what we need to understand
is how change happens.
Change happens exponentially.
Our connection to other people and their connection to others
and so and so create an exponential function
which explains for an example--
that those of you are familiar with-- "butterfly effect"
how a butterfly flapping its wings
in Singapore can theoretically cause a tornado in Florida.
Because on particle hits another and another and another.
It also explains the phenomenal 6 degrees of separation:
how we are all connected and interconnected
in a web potentially of goodness.
To illustrate the exponential nature of human networks,
let's look at smiles.
What do we know from research is that smiles are contagious.
Someone smiles-- makes you smile.
You smile-- you make someone smile.
And so on and so on.
You know, even some goes pass you on the street and you don't smile
ostensibly you don't smile--
there are certain micro-muscles in your face
that are moving that actually make you feel better.
So smiles are contagious.
Now if you smiled to--
or make three people smile,
and these three people--
each one makes three other people smile.
And those nine people make three--
each one-- three other people smile.
Within 20 degrees of separation from you
initial smile to the three people,
the entire world will be smiling.
Exponential nature of social networks.
The same with making other people feel good--
complimenting people.
00:09:26,500 --&gt; 00:09:27,940
If you make three people--
or even better, four people a day feel good and they make--
they pay it forward and make four others feel good,
00:09:34,630 --&gt; 00:09:36,270
and so on and so on.
Within very little time,
the whole world will be made to feel better.
This is the nature of an exponential function.
So smiles and laughters are contagious.
And to illustrate, I want to show you a quick video.
(Spanish) (The sentence shown on the screen at the end,
"Dificil, eh?" means " Difficult, isn't it?")
Alright. I have to see this one more time.
Sorry.
So the theme of the class today is babies.
We are going to see another one soon.
So let's understand: what is the nature of exponential function
so that we can understand the power of one?
I'm looking for someone to make a deal with me.
Here is the deal: What I am going to do is ask you--
this is all voluntary,
you don't have to do it-- here's the deal.
I am going to ask you to give me each day--
or rather I'm going to give you,
whoever signs the deal with me,
1000 dollars every single day for the next 30 days.
And what you will give me in return is on the first day,
one cent-- one penny;
on the second day, two cents; third day, 4 cents...
Every day, twice as much as the previous day,
starting with one.
Who would like to make this deal with me?
Again, every day I give you for the next 30 days 1000 dollars.
What you'll do is every day for the next 30 days give me one cent,
next day two, four, eight and so on.
Anyone? Any takers?
One.
Looking for some more.
So that's 30000 down for me.
Anymore? Ok, good.
Alright. So here' s the deal.
Here is what will happen.
On the 30th day, I will give you another 1000 dollars--
you'll have a total of 30000 dollars from me.
On the 30th day, I will be getting from you in total,
including the first 29 days--
no, rather on the 30th day,
I'll be getting from you 5,368,709 dollars and 12 cents.
Double that, times by two,
this is the money I will be making in one month.
One cent on the first, two on the second, and so on.
For most people, it seems extraordinary
because people don' understand the nature of exponential function
and therefore don't understand the nature of the power of one.
Here is another example.
Just kidding. I'll let you off the hook.
Another example. This captured my imagination--
when I was a kid,
my dad told me about the invention of the chess game--
some of you know the story.
So the inventor of the chess game--
he was in India, and went to the local king.
The king was very impressed with the game and said,
"How can I reward you?" And the chess player said,
"No, it' OK really."
The king said, "No. I want to reward you.
How can I rewards you?"
So the inventor of the chess game said,
"Ok. What I like is on the first block,
first square,
I would like one grain of rice.
On the second, I'd like two grains of rice.
On the third, four grains of rice and so on and so on.
That's my request."
And the king said, "Are you sure that's all you want?
I'm prepared to give you a lot.
This is a wonderful game."
And the inventor said, "Yes."
So the king told his assistant to go and get the man,
give the man his wish.
When they started to calculate
how much rice would be need to fill up all blocks,
all the way to 2 to the power 63.
They realized that the rice could
fill up the entire world with a thick layer.
Again, misleading--
fail to understand it because we don't understand
the nature of exponential change.
Another-- last one.
So how many time do you think--
you all have a piece of paper in front you--
how many time do you think you need to roll over the piece of paper
for the piece of paper to reach the moon?
The moon, 240000 miles awaya from us.
How many times do you need to fold the piece of paper
so that you can reach the moon.
41 times.
So if you can have a piece of paper here,
and you fold it 41 times by the end of the class,
you can reach the moon.
I don't know why they make such a big deal out of
the person landing on the moon.
Seems quite simple to me.
And here is the point.
We underestimate our capacity to affect change.
Because we underestimate the growth of exponential function.
We are influencing people and the world every minute of our lives.
The question though is in which direction are we going to do it.
Are we going to be a force for change? Be deliberate?
Be practical idealists?
Or just have the good intentions without the effort
that's necessary to bring about a positive exponential function.
The final project for this course,
as you know is a presentation that you'll give
whether it's for the (?) students or the extension school students.
You'll be giving a lecture to other people.
And when we put together the class,
this is precisely what we thought about:
how you affect change and those people whom you change
will hopefully influence others and so on and so on.
In many ways, the idea was taken from the film "Pay it Forward".
What I want to do now is show you a quick excerpt--
just the coming soon of "Pay it Forward",
for those of you who haven't seen it.
Because in "Pay it Forward",
they capture this very idea of
human networks as exponential functions.
We underestinmate our capacity to effect change
because we underestimate the growth of an exponential function
What if the world is just a big disappointment?
Unless you take the things that you don't like about this world
and you flip them upside down and you can start that today.
That's me.
And that's three people.
And I'm going to help them.
And they do it for three other people.
And they do it for three more.
It has to be something really big.
Something they can do by themselves.
is it possible let one idea to change the world
Lost your car?
That's a keen observation.
I can help you.
You are giving me a brand new Jaguar and you don't want anything.
Call it generosity between two strangers.
What did you tell my son
to make him bring homeless man into my house?
I've got a story, Ok?
A senior partner of Chandling and Moss is giving away new cars?
Just pay it forward.
Three big favors for three other people.
You can't just put two people together and make them like each other.
It's the one.
Pay it forward. Pay it forward.
Just like the idea.
You could fix a person.
Do you want to come in and stay?
- It's just complicated.     - Come in.
Supposed to be something hard.
I don't care about your burns,
Eugene, if that's even what they are.
Is that what they are?
I can't.
So sorry.
Don't tell me how sorry you are for me.
Maybe you are scared to get rejected;
well, I can't reject you, you're too quick for me!
Are you still going to pay it forward?
Give her another chance for me.
You will miss!
I wanna wear the green dress.
No, you smell good!
- Are you sure?      - Yeah, yeah!
Pay it forward is a movement in LA, Mrs. McKenney.
- Come on!       - A movement?
So you are like flunk us if we don't change the world?
You might just scrape by with a C.
Impact three people.
Each impact three others and three others.
Within 20 degrees of separation.
You can change the world, the entire world.
Premise number 3: .
internal factors versus external factors.
There is a lot of research showing
how difficult it is to change happiness based on external factors.
Research on subjective wellbeing--
the term that psychologists use to capture happiness essentially
has been going on for very, very long time.
Until recently, most of the research was conducted,
was done using questionnaires.
And many people rightfully so questioned the veracity,
the value of these questionnaires,
because it is subjective--
are we measuring something real?
Over the last few years,
what started to happen is more and more psychologists
have been using brain scans for example;
they've been using fMRIs, EEGs, other physiological measures.
And what they found interestingly is that
there is a very high correlation
between the "objective" measures such as brain scans,
such as EEGs, such as fMRI, such as physiological measures
and people's evaluation of their wellbeing--
in other words, subjective levels of happiness.
Very high correlation between the two which in many ways
gives credence to the many years of research that has been conducted,
before we have the technology to do it in a more sophisticated way.
So the research I am going to share with you--
some of it is taken using the brain scans,
other is self-evaluation.
But again, both are meaningful as well as valuable.
We'll get more into the way that the research is conducted
when we talk about phenomenon such as meditation.
Or people like Richie Davidson actually scanned the brain
and showed significant changes
as a result of an 8-week meditation program.
Or people like a very young Joshua Greene,
who does a research on morality
and shows that we have morality centers in our brain.
So it's becoming much more sophisticated,
much more interesting and the interesting thing
about it is that it verifies a lot of the research
that has been done to date with far less sophisticated means,
such as self-repport.
Research done by Daniel Gilbert
who teaches Psych1 on effective forecasting.
Here is one of his studies.
So what he did was go to professors
who were just before either getting the tenure decision:
so either they were going to get the tenure or not.
And he asked them, "How happy are you going to be,
if you get the tenure?"
And they said, "Ecstatic!
This is something I've working on for many years
and this will be it.
This will be a dream come true."
And-- "How happy are you going to stay for?"
And they said, "For the rest of our lives.
Because this is something we've been working for very long time.
It will make everything so much easier.
I can get off the publish-or-perish race.
I can enjoy my work much more.
This is going to transform my life."
And he asked them, "What happens if you don't get tenure?
If you are rejected?"
And they said, "We are going to be devastated.
This is something we've been working for many, many years."
And-- "How long are you going to be devastated for?"
"Probably until we get tenure somewhere else.
But even then, that may not be enough."--
Because once you don't get tenure in one place,
you don't go up in terms of the ranking of the school--
00:23:28,670 --&gt; 00:23:31,520
you very often would get tenure but elsewhere,
school that is not considered as good as the one
where you were rejected.
So it will be devastating for a very long time.
And Gilbert went to them at the moment
when they got the tenure decision.
Some of them got them. Others did not.
"How are you feeling?" He asked.
Those who got it,
"Ecstatic! Happiest we've ever been."
And-- "How long are you going to stay happy for?"
"For the rest of our lives.
We've made it."
And then he went to those who didn't get tenure and asked them,
"How are you feeling?"
They were devastated.
And they were sure that
they were going to remain devastated for a very long time.
And he went back to see them three months later,
six months later.
And what Gilbert and his colleagues found
was that almost to the person,
those who got tenure or did not get tenure
went back to their previous level of well-being:
If they were happy before,
they were happy six months hence;
if they were unhappy before,
regardless whether they get tenure or not,
they were not happy.
In other words, it looks like this and went back to base level or;
it looks like this and back to base level.
They did the same with lottery winners.
"What if you really win ten million dollars,
will it actually make you happier?"
Yes-- for a while, but not for long.
Philip Brickman，Northwestern University did this research.
After within 6 months,
people go back to their base level of wellbeing.
People in serious accidents with their paralysis
as the result of the accident,
very often, usually--
again, this is all the average--
go back to their base level of happiness:
if they are happy before,
they will be happy one year after;
if they are unhappy, they will remain unhappy.
Extreme circumstances make very little difference to our wellbeing.
University of Illinois professor Ed Diener
does a lot of research on happiness levels.
He has been doing it since the 1970s.
What he shows--
he and others including Daniel Kahneman, Nobel prize winner--
show is that wealth matters very little to our levels of wellbeing.
Just like the lottery
would make a very little difference to our wellbeing.
Now this does not mean that a person who doesn't have enough food,
someone who is homeless on the streets here,
gets an extra thousand or two thousand dollars a month--
that of course will make him or her much happier.
But beyond the basic needs,
once our basic needs are met and that means food,
shelter, basic education.
Once those needs are met,
income makes very little difference.
No change across generations.
Our generation is much wealthier than our parents,
much, much wealthier than our grandparents' generation.
We are not happier.
And that is global--
whether it's China, whether it's in the UK or Australia,
or the United States.
Levels of happiness are essentially static;
and anxiety levels and depression levels,
as we talked about in the first class have gone up significantly.
So income levels make very little difference.
In general, external circumstances make very little difference.
I mean, think about your own experience:
how did you feel--
go back, just transport yourself
to experience of getting into Harvard,
getting this big package in the mail which said "You were accepted"
on April 1 or the end of December,
when you got this pack--
how did you feel? Probably ecstatic.
Probably one of your highlights.
And that moment, if you are like me,
you thought, "This is it.
I'm really going to be happy for a very long time.
Cos I really struggled in high school--
a lot of it was difficult;
a lot of it was painful, but it was all worth it.
I made it."
And you went along with that feeling the next day,
because in school they started to talk about how you got in.
And you felt fantastic about it, right?
And you felt great probably for the rest of the senior year--
I mean, still ups and downs;
but overall, high levels of happiness.
And it was going to last for the rest of your life.
And you came here-- Freshmen week,
you knew it was going to last for the rest of your life.
Because you were around wonderful people.
It was fun. There were parties.
And you said, "Everything they said about Harvard was not true.
It's actually a party school."
You were certain of that, right?
And not only was it a party school,
you were going to have an amazing time for the four years and beyond.
Because your life was transformed by this letter of acceptance,
right?
Things started to change probably on the first day of class,
but not entirely--
because there's shopping period and it's such a wonderful thing--
you shop for classes.
It's even better than going to the mall--
so many, 3000 classes to choose from.
And this second week of Harvard is fantastic
and it was going to continue just that way,
constant tide for the rest of your life.
And then suddenly things begin to change.
Slightly. Ever so slightly.
And they completely change once your first paper is due
or the midterms arrive.
And you go back to your base level of wellbeing.
If you experience a lot of stress
in high school and elementary school and were unhappy,
generally the best predictor would say that
you would feel the same way a month into your Harvard experience.
External circumstances matter very little. Very little.
In fact, also, place of residents makes very little difference.
People think, " Well, if I move--
especially in the day-light--
if I move to California, I'll be happier, right?" Wrong.
Californians are no happier than people in Massachusetts.
Initially when we go to a warm place,
we feel the relief and there's this spiky level of wellbeing.
But very quickly we go back to our base level
exactly where we were before.
I'll take this even a step further,
even though there is no research about this,
I bet you this is correct:
there is no difference in our levels of wellbeing
if our place of residents is by the river
or in the quad.
This is really taking the theory far, but it's true.
I love this T-shirt-- what?
If you can't run with the big dogs, stay in yard.
Anyone from Korea here? Alright.
You made it all the way on such a cold day.
Well done! I appreciated it.
How spoiled we get here. Makes very little difference.
Very little difference--
where we are, where we live,
income levels, lottery, tenure,
getting into our dream college,
getting our dream job for you seniors--
you may have just gotten it.
Yeah, you are going to have a spike in your level of wellbeing--
I'm sure you had a spike in your level of wellbeing
when you got this acceptance letter,
but very quickly we go back to our base level.
One thing that does matter to our base level of wellbeing
which is external circumstance is democracy versus oppression.
People living in democracies are generally significantly
happier than people living in dictatorships.
Women, for example,
living in places where they are oppressed are in general
less happy than women living in free countries.
People living in Darfur are certainly
less happy than people living in Denmark or the United States.
But again, these are the extreme circumstance
that do make a difference,
such as I said, a homeless person,
of course, income will make a difference to that person.
Moving to a free country,
of course, will make a difference to their wellbeing.
But beyond the extremes,
additions or subtractions to our external circumstances
make very little difference.
Now this is good news and bad news.
The bad news is it seems like whatever we do,
it doesn't matter.
So why am I working hard in order to get that BCG job?
why did I work so hard in order to get into this place?
If it doesn't matter, if I experience this ups and downs.
And the answer is that--
yes it won't make a difference to our wellbeing
but it also doesn't mean that
we cannot increase our level of wellbeing.
Many people said the problem
with general levels of happiness or unhappiness rather,
the cause is people have too high expectations.
And if we lower our expectations,
we lower our stress levels and we will enjoy life more.
"Ok, so I don't care if I don't get a B in the course.
I'd be much happier if I don't care,
if I lower my levels of expectation.
I don't care what I get into, what job I have,
I just want to be happy."
And you'll probably be happy.
Slightly happy if you lower your levels of expectations,
but not in the long term.
And we'll talk about it next week.
Not in the long term.
The problem is not lower these high expectations--
that doesn't matter.
The problem is right versus wrong expectations.
Not lower high expectations--
that won't make a difference to our levels of wellbeing.
What will make a difference to our levels of wellbeing
is if we have right vs. wrong expectations.
It is wrong expectation to expect that getting into a certain place,
getting a raise,
finding our dream partner,
00:34:38,660 --&gt; 00:34:41,540
is responsible for our happiness.
Moving to California or to (Forts Heimer?).
That in and of itself will not make us happier.
That's wrong expectation.
The right expectation is to believe in change from within.
So these things will not make us happy.
In fact, our readiness and potential to experience happiness
is mostly depended on our state of mind,
not on our status, or the states of our bank account.
It's about changing our perception-- state of mind.
It's about changing our interpretation of the world,
of what's happening to us, of our achievements, of our failures.
It's about what we choose to perceive,
what we choose to focus on.
It's about transformation,
as opposed to the external information or the external success.
1504-- this whole course,
is about this transformation,
as I mentioned during the first lesson.
I want to move on to the fourth premise,
one of the most important premises in this course.
And in many ways,
we can understand human intellectual history
just based on this idea:
should we accept human nature?
Or can we perfect it?
And can it change?
This work relies on--
or these ideas rely on the work of Thomas Sowell.
Thomas Sowell, Harvard class of 58,
now at Stanford, the Hoover Institute,
one of my intellectual heroes.
And what he does and what his work does is basically explain
why people choose to back one political party versus the other;
why they choose to live one kind of life versus the other.
This single book helped me understand myself better
as well as other people better--
whether it's politically,
whether it's psychologically, whether it's philosophically.
Those of you who are interested in politics
and there is one book you want to read,
after you read Marva Collins of course, it's this.
So what does Thomas Sowell say?
Essentially what he does is divide people into two camps
those who hold constrained vision,
the limited vision;
and those who hold the unconstrained,
the unlimited vision of human nature.
People who hold constrained vision of human nature,
believe that human nature cannot be changed;
it's immutable-- we have certain instincts,
we have certain inclinations.
They are fixed. This is it.
What you see is what you get.
What you are born with or were born with,
as species, is all we have.
The flaws that are out there are inevitable--
they cannot be changed.
We need to accept them for what they are.
That's the only thing we can do with these flaws.
And people who have the constrained vision think
that our instincts, our inclinations,
our basic nature is immutable, accepted.
And then what they do, rather than resign, they channel it.
How do they channel it?
By building certain political institutions
that would channel the flawed,
imperfect human nature toward the good.
Philosophers and psychologists
who fall under the constrained vision create them,
philosophies and psychologies and institutions and systems
to channel our flawed and imperfect nature.
People who fall under the constrained vision in the history of ideas,
are people such as Alexander Hamilton, Adam Smith--
those of you are taking or will take EC 10,
?, Fredrick Kayak.
These are people who say,
"our nature is constrained.
It's limited." Edmund Burke-- another one.
What captures this idea best--
the words of Francis Bacon,
considered the father of the scientific movement,
was a philosopher in 1600s:
"Nature to be commanded must be obeyed."
Whether it's physical nature, or human nature.
We need to obey it.
It is what it is.
Now we have the unconstrained vision.
Perhaps you are a little bit more optimistic,
a little bit more utopian-- human nature can be improved.
It can be changed.
It is up to us to do so. It is perfectable.
We don't need to accept these flaws as inevitable.
We can perfect it.
There are solutions to these flaws,
to these imperfections and our role--
the goal of institutions,
whether it's political institutions,
educational institutions, of systems,
organizations, individual philosophers, psychologists,
the role is to change our nature,
to perfect it, to better it.
Philosophers who help this position:
people like Thomas Jefferson,
people like Jean-Jacques Rousseau,
George Bernard Shaw, Ronald Dworkin and other leading thinkers.
And what Thomas Sowell did
was map the entire intellectual history
of world showing how people who held this view versus that view,
that two radically different political prescriptions.
The person who best captures the unconstrained view,
Benjamin Constant, French philosopher and politician,
"It is for self-perfectioning that destiny calls us."
Generally people on constrained view,
are people politically, not always,
but usually people who would support capitalism--
people like Adam Smith,
who talked about "invisible hand"--
Let's channel imperfect, perhaps flawed human nature toward the good.
People who are more on the unconstrained vision
would tend toward Utopianism or sometimes communism.
Not always, but sometimes.
Why? Because let's change human nature.
Self-interest is not good.
It hurts in the long term and therefore,
we need to change it rather than the constrained vision--
people who said,
"We may not like it, but it is what it is.
We cannot change it.
Let's make the best of it and channel it toward the good."
Two radical views.
Two radical prescriptions based on people's notion perspective.
So why am I telling you this?
This is not a political science class.
Because it has every relevance to psychology as well.
It has every relevance to psychology:
Do we perceive reality,
human nature as constrained or unconstrained
will ultimately affect our psychology.
And this is very meaningful and important.
Let me explain.
Now first of all,
some people who have the constrained view when it comes to politics,
have the unconstrained view when it comes to psychology,
so it is not always consistent,
though it very often is.
So the vision of psychology this course promotes
is the constrained view.
In other words, my belief--
and I am going to back that up with research today
and for the next semester--
is human nature is fixed.
We have inclinations.
We have certain instincts that are there
and have been formed either God-given or evolutionary-given
for millions of years that have been formed.
They are not going to change any time soon.
Not in our life time.
It's fixed.
We are stuck with them through good and ill.
And all we can do after we accept this nature
is to first understand it through research,
and then after we understand it,
make the best use of it.
Understand it through research as well as through the search--
through introspection,
and then make the best use of it.
How can I channel my nature?
And what I want to do now is illustrate a case study
of what I mean by nature constrained
and why it is so important for happiness,
for wellbeing, for long-term success
to have the constrained view of human nature
when it comes to our psychology that is.
The topic I want to talk about is the permission to be human.
I am going to talk about this topic for three reasons.
A, because it illustrates what Thomas Sowell means
politically in the psychological realm.
Second, because I think it is one of
the most important pillars of wellbeing and happiness.
The third reason why I want to talk about it is
because it gets to misunderstanding that many people have
regarding what positive psychology is and is not.
When I first started teaching this course
and had six students,
I remember one day sitting in Leverett House,
having lunch by myself and one of the students comes in and says,
"can I join you?" "Sure." we have lunch.
And he says to me,
"Tal, I hear you teaching a class on happiness."
And I said to him, "Yes. That's right."
And he said, "You know, my roommates are taking your class."
And I said, "That's wonderful."
There were two of the six.
And he said, "But Tal, you've got to watch out now."
And I said to him, "Why?"
And he said, "Tal, you'll have to be careful."
And I said, "Why?"
And he said, "Because if I see you unhappy,
I'll tell them."
The next day in class,
I used that and I said to the students,
"You know, the last thing in the world that I want you to think
is that I experience a constant high or that you,
820
by the end of the semester or the year--
it was a year course,
you-- by the end of the year--
will experience a constant high."
There are two kinds of people,
who experience this constant high,
who don't experience painful emotions such as anger,
or envy, or disappointment,
or sadness, or unhappiness,
or depression, or anxiety at times--
two kinds of people who don't experience these painful emotions:
the one kind are the psychopaths--
by definition they don't experience these painful emotions;
the second kind of people
who don't experience these painful emotions are dead people.
Exactly! So you know,
if you experience these emotions,
it's a good sign.
You are not a psychopath, and you are alive.
However, in our culture today,
we don't give ourselves the permission to be human,
the freedom to experience these painful emotions as well.
And we pay a very high price for this inability,
for this refusal to accept the fact
that it is part of human nature that is constrained,
that is there no matter what.
As kids, as babies--
going back to the baby's scene,
we give ourselves the permission to be human,
we know that it's natural.
We don't even think about it in fact,
to experience the high and then the low and high and then low.
And later on, when we stop giving ourselves the permission
to be human when the facade become so important,
we begin to realize that other people are watching us
and evaluating us constantly
and we think they do so much more than they actually do.
That's when we stop giving ourselves the permission to be human,
and we pay a price, in terms of our energy levels,
of our wellbeing, of our happiness,
of our creativity, and ultimately also our success.
Let me give an example of someone
who does give himself the permission to be human.
The Permission to be Human
Now I'm saying we should look like this.
But what I am saying is that we all need a space,
a place in our own lives
where we give ourselves the permission to be human,
whether it's with close friends,
people we care about,
whether it's first and foremost with ourselves
when we write a journal,
where we do give ourselves the permission to be,
to cry, to be joyous--
because if we don't,
we pay a price.
We need a space of unconditional acceptance.
The best advice that I got,
or that we got--
my wife and I got when David,
our first son was born from our pediatrician, Dr. Tok Shapiro--
and David was born at 1 AM in the morning
and around 8 AM in the morning,
he came in to see, to check up on my wife,
to check up on the baby,
for some reason, he didn't check up on me.
And everything was fine.
As he is leaving the room,
he turned around and said,
" Just one more thing.
over the next few months,
you are going to be experiencing every single kind of emotion
to the extreme and that's fine.
It's natural.
We all go through it."
And he walked out.
It was the best advice
that my wife and I got regarding child-rearing.
Why? Let me give you an example.
So after about a month,
I started to, once in a while,
experience some envy toward David.
Because here he was for the first time in--
well, since my wife and I were together--
someone else is getting much more attention than I was,
no matter how much I cried.
And I felt envy toward him and five minutes later,
I experienced this most intense love toward him--
the emotion that I haven't felt before.
Now normally I would think,
"what a hypocritic!
It's just something is wrong:
one minute you are envious and the next minute you experience love?"
There is nothing wrong.
There is everything right.
It's part of being human.
And because I had Dr.Shapiro's voice at back of my mind--
permission to be human,
that helped me a great deal--
experience the envy when I experienced it, accept it;
and then enjoy and celebrate it--
the positive emotions that I experienced toward David.
Permission to be human.
You see, there is actually a paradox playing--
this is work done by our very own Daniel Wegner on ironic processing.
When we suppress a natural phenomenon,
that phenomenon only strengthens.
Let me illustrate through an experiment.
So for the next ten seconds,
do not think of a pink elephant.
For the next ten seconds, do not think of a pink elephant.
You know the one that I am talking about?
With the big ears, Dumbo?
Do not think of a pink elephant for the next three seconds
and I am sure no one thought of a pink elephant right?
What happened? -- Most people thought of a pink elephant.
Because when we try to suppress a natural phenomenon
such as having a visual of the word when we say it,
that thing just intensifies.
The same applies to the painful emotions that are natural.
And when we try to suppress them, they strengthen.
When I started to teach after hearing about
Marva Collins and deciding teaching is my calling,
I knew that I had to deal with the problem--
the problem is that I am introvert,
I get very nervous in front of audiences and large audiences for me
is anything but five.
But I had to deal with it
948
and I knew I would have to deal with it.
So I would go on in front of audience and before
that I would say to myself,
"Tal, don't be nervous.
Don't be anxious.
No anxiety today.
Don't be nervous.
Don't be nervous. Don't!"
And what happened?--
Pink elephants all around.
Instead after especially reading
about paradoxical intentions by Victor Frankl,
I started to give myself the permission to be human.
And now when I go into a lecture, the nervousness--
because I give myself the permission to be human--
goes away within as little as three hours into the lecture.
But no, it's manageable.
I still get nervous before every single lecture,
which is actually a good thing. But it's managable.
I can deal with it. I can handle it.
Permission to be human.
You see, rejecting our nature leads to suboptimal performance
emotionally as well as in terms of external performance.
Imagine waking up every morning and saying to yourself:
"I refuse to accept the law of gravity.
This law of gravity is such a pain.
You need to walk down the stairs and then up the stairs.
I just want to float to Sanders (Sanders Theatre) in the morning.
I just want to float to the dining hall after--
so much easier, so much less painful."
Imagine leading a life like this.
Will you truly refuse to accept the law of gravity?
What kind of life would you lead?
Well, first of all, you may not survive for long,
if you truly don't accept the fact that things,
people being no exception fall when left in mid-air.
But even if you do survive--
let's the ground floor--
even if you do survive,
you would lead a life of constant frustration--
refusing to accept something that is there
whether you like it or not.
So instead we accept the law of gravity.
More than that, we create games around the law of gravity.
I mean all those of you doing sports here--
and it's most of you in this room who are doing athletics,
who go for a run, you rely on the law of gravity.
Can you imagine
Harvard vs. Yale football without the law of gravity?
Can you imagine a basketball game without the law of gravity?
I am not talking about Michael Jordan, but for the (?).
We accept it and we create games around it.
And yet we don't do the same when it comes to our emotions.
Now here is the key point:
Painful emotions are as much as part of human nature
as the law of gravity is part of physical nature.
And "nature to be commanded must be obeyed".
And the aeronautics engineer
who wants to build an airplane has to obey,
take into consideration, learn it,
study and understand the law of gravity.
The same applies to a psychologist.
The constrained view of human nature.
"Nature to be commanded must be obeyed."
And yet we don't do that.
We don't do in our culture.
And we pay a high price for it.
We have what I called, "the great deception".
We are people who ask, "So how are you doing?"
And we say, "Fine. Just great."
Well in fact, we are not doing so well.
More appropriate would be "I'm going through a rough patch now.
I'm going through a hard time. I'm really stressed."
But yet, we don't want to admit that.
We don't give ourselves the permission to be human,
because we think there is something wrong with us
if we experience these emotions.
And then when everyone says,
"Oh fine. Oh great. Oh terrific",
then we are asked "How are you doing?"
I am not going to be the only party poop here.
I am not going to be the only depressed one around here.
So I said, "Oh fine. Oh great."
And then we contribute to this great deception
and it is this great deception that leads to the great depression--
the great depression in the ultimate currency of happiness.
This, to great extent,
explains why so many people today
experience depression the 45% figure,
nationwide on college campuses.
Not enough permission to be human.
I am not talking about wearing our heart on our sleeves.
When someone comes to us
in the elevator in William James (William James Hall),
I says, "How are you doing?"
"Thank you for asking.
You know it all started when I was three."
This is not what I am talking about.
In William James, maybe the case--
because the elevator--
it does take two hours to get there for the door to close.
But other than that.
I'm not talking about.
what I'm talking about is a space,
a safe space in our lives with our closest friends,
1053
with our family, first and foremost, with ourselves,
will we have the permission to be human.
And what I'm not talking about is resignation.
Far from it. It's not about saying,
"Well I'm depressed. There's nothing I can do about it.
I accept my nature.
I accept my state.
And that's it."
I'm not talking about resignation.
what I'm talking about is active acceptance.
1063
What does that mean?
It means understanding that certain things
I cannot change and certain things I can and ought to change.
One of the main ideas we'll talk about is the distinction:
we'll talk about specifically on the lecture on change
between affect, behaviors and cognitions.
The A, B, C of psychology.
Affect-- emotion. Behavior-- action.
Cognition-- thoughts.
Unconditional acceptance,
permission to be human relates primarily to our affect,
to our emotions.
They are there, just like the law of gravity is there.
That does not mean we need to accept our behavior and our cognition.
For example, I can--
and having the past experience--
envy towards my best friend,
that in and of itself does not make me a bad person.
It's human.
I've never met a person
who has never experienced or does not experience--
well, maybe the Dalai Lama--
but other than that,
who does not experience envy toward other people.
And if it is true about the Dalai Lama,
that is because he's worked on it for decades.
Envy is part of human nature--
nothing good or bad about the envy.
Nothing good or bad about experiencing the anger.
Nothing good or bad about experiencing the depression or anxiety.
It's part of human nature.
However, the question is,
how do I choose to behave,
to act as a result of it?
That is where the moral domain enters.
00:59:57,810 --&gt; 01:00:01,
That's where I can have moral or immoral behavior
toward my best friend or baby, or other people in general.
I can still experience envy toward my best friend
and choose to behave generously and benevolently toward him.
The same with cognition and we will talk a lot about it
when we talk about CBT-- Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.
I can feel it certain way.
But it doesn't mean that
I need to resign to my thoughts about that feeling.
Rumination is one of the things that we'll talk about a lot
actually not that helpful--
to ruminate about painful emotions.
It's much helpful to write about them.
To talk to other people about them,
rather than just be thinking constantly about
how miserable I am because my girlfriend just left.
I haven't found anyone in Pinocchio's.
So rumination doesn't help.
So I don't necessarily accept
all my irrational thoughts and again,
we'll talk about it much more next week of
how we can cognitively reframe what we were thinking.
But the emotion-- that affect is the emotion,
it is what it is.
And the key is to be true to reality,
which is also one of the main themes in the course.
In many ways, this course should not be called "Positive Psychology".
But I am telling you this after you already signed up for the class
so it is too late to leave.
This is actually not a course on positive psychology.
It's a course in reality psychology.
Because positive psychology may mean that
we are only focusing on the positive and what works,
ignoring all the rest that are not.
Overdoing this class is shifting the pendulum.
So there is more even playing field instead of the 21:1 ratio,
we are doing much more, focusing on the positive.
And at the same time,
accepting the painful emotions
are as much part of human nature as the wonderful emotions.
And sooner we accept it, the better.
That won't mean at the end of the course of 1504 or 
or 100 other courses in the workshop
and sold the books that you read,
it's not that you will not have painful emotions anymore.
It's simply your psychological immune system will become stronger,
hopefully already by the end of this semester.
Psychological immune system will become stronger.
And that means not that we don't get ill.
It means we get ill less often and when we do get sick,
we'll recover more promptly.
The difference between the extremely happy people
and extremely unhappy people is not that one gets sad,
of upset, or anxious, or depressed;
and the other does not.
Both groups do.
It's how quickly,
how promptly we can recover from these painful emotions--
in other words, how strong our psychological immune system is.
And our psychological immune system strengthens
when we give ourselves the permission to be human.
Many of you've probably read this,
come across this, but I think this captures
so well the foundation of what it means to be actively accepting.
This has become the official mantra in many ways of the AA movement:
"God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change;
the courage to change the things I can change;
and wisdom to know the difference."
The wisdom to know the difference--
fortunately, a lot of this wisdom can come from studies,
from research, from deep introspection that
you will do throughout the semester.
What I want to do now is an exercise.
I want to do a group meditation.
Trying to understand,
not just on the cognitive level of the research,
but also to experience on the visceral emotional level,
what it really means to give ourselves the permission to be human.
Those of you who don't feel comfortable doing it,
you don't have to do it.
Those who feel comfortable to do it, do it.
If it's a stretch for you,
I still recommend that you do it.
If you never meditate before,
this is a wonderful opportunity to do it for the first time.
One thing I do ask you:
If you are not doing it,
if you don't participate,
simply just keep quiet.
Other than that, I really do recommend that you join us.
What I want to do together now
is enter the realm of unconditional acceptance.
Se?or, just sit up straight as much as possible.
If possible, your back relaxing against the back rest.
Plant your feet comfortably on the floor.
If you feel comfortable, close your eyes.
Shift the focus of your breath.
Shift the focus of your thoughts to your breathing.
Take a deep breath in all the way down to your belly.
And then breathe out.
Again, deep breath in;
slow, gentle, quiet breath out.
Repeat that in silence.
If your mind wanders, simply bring it back to your breathing.
Deep, slow inhalation.
Deep, slow, gentle, quiet exhalation.
Most of us don't breathe deeply enough.
We don't take the time to celebrate our breath,
our spirit, our being.
The connection, the link,
the bridge between our mind and our body;
between our emotions and our thoughts;
between the brain and the heart.
Continue with the deep breathing.
As you continue with the deep breath,
shift your focus to your emotions, to your feelings.
How are you doing?
How are you feeling?
Pay attention to your emotions.
Whatever they are, whatever it is that your feeling,
allow it to float through you. Naturally.
Just experience your emotion whatever it is.
You may feel one emotion at one moment,
different emotion the next. That's Ok.
Whatever it is, accept it.
Experience it.
Give yourself the permission to be human.
It's all OK. Just breath.
Continue to observe and experience whatever emotion comes up,
whether it's calm or happiness,
whether it's anxiety, confusion, boredom or joy.
Whatever it is,
continue to breathe deeply into your belly.
And gently, slowly, quietly exhale.
Let the emotion flow just like the breath.
As you continue breathing deeply,
in your mind's eye,
see yourself walking out of this classroom today,
walking in the yard,
with the feeling that all your feelings
are real fine part of human nature.
They just are.
Neither good nor bad.
As you walk amid the buildings and trees,
as you see your friends and classmates,
allow these emotions to float through you,
freely, lightly.
By experiencing these emotions,
whether the ups and the downs,
what you are doing is being,
being a human being.
Continue to allow the breath and the emotions to just flow.
To just be.
What if you truly gave yourself the permission to be human?
What if you are giving yourself the permission to be human?
Just imagine.
Life becomes so much lighter.
So much simpler.
When, rather than trying to fight or defeat our nature,
we accept it.
We accept who we are.
We accept whatever emotion comes up.
Deep, slow inhalation.
Slow, gentle, quiet, calm exhalation.
Take a few deep breaths in silence.
Embrace the silence, the stillness.
Embrace yourself, your emotions.
And on your next exhalation--
deep, slow, quiet exhalation,
open your eyes.
If the person next to you is asleep,
gently wake him or her up.
Just imagine
Just imagine the kind of life that you can experience --
hush-- the kind of life you can lead,
if you truly, genuinely,
really gave yourself the permission to be human.
It's one of the pillars of healthy life,
psychologically, physiologically.
So try it.
Everyday remind yourself just once or twice
to give yourself the permission to be human.
And give others that same permission.
You deserve it.</p><p style="font-size:16px;color:#333333;line-height:30px;font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-weight:normal;text-align:left" data-flag="normal" lang="en">大家好

情人节快乐
早上好
请他们献歌时
本来想选另一首歌
但是…算了吧
我们确实爱你们
今天课程的内容
是上节课的延续
是这门课的基本前提
"我们来自哪里 我们将去哪里"
从各个方面展开论述
螺旋的基础
我们将在本学期一起创建它
上次我们讲到改变有多么困难
我们谈到"双胞胎研究" 举例说明了
Lykken和Tellegen提出的
也许改变我们幸福水平
和试图改变身高一样困难和徒劳无功
然后谈到这些研究学者么犯的
一般性的失误和错误
误解改变的本质
因为如果一个人在改变
问题已不再是"是否可能改变？"
而是"怎样才可能改变"
还谈到剑桥-萨默维尔研究
证明劳斯莱斯干预彻底失败
五年来 剑桥 哈佛和麻省理工的
顶尖科学家 研究人员
精神病专家和心理学家
沥尽心血 带着美好的意图
实施改变 但最终失败
不仅没有实现正面的改变
实际上是带去了负面的改变
还记得吗? 干预组的酗酒比例
和对照组相比是增加的
未参与干预的对照组
更有可能在二三十年后获得升职
改变是困难的
但我们又说
"Marva Collins实现了改变
所以改变是可能的"
Martin Seligmen和Karen Reivich
及大量学者都成功地实现改变
困难在于
如果我们想成为实践理想主义者
就要理解是什么带来改变然后去做
传播理念
传播研究的理念
即使研究并非总是传达好消息
它传达的是行之有效的方法
可为的方式而不是空洞的梦想
渴望 希望 愿望
那远远不够
好的意愿 理想主义 好的意图是不够的
我们需要扎根于研究
这正是Maslow的想法
当他谈及类似的曼哈顿计划时
科学家 积极心理学家 当时的心理学家
社学科学工作者聚在一起
在流行学术领域中挑选出
几种观念
几个有效的项目 再复制它们
研究最好的 正如Mariam同学
课后找到我时说的
"流行学术其实是要将杰出大众化"
我喜欢这个说法
将杰出大众化
研究最好的再应用在其他人身上
我们有了这样一个伟大的计划
有了Maslow创造类似曼哈顿计划的伟大想法
但是如果我不想参与计划？
不想成为学者
只想做自己的事 我能否实现改变？
答案是 绝对能够
人若想在世间有所为
真正实现改变
94
面对的最显著障碍之一
是他们低估自己实现改变的能力
心理学界有很多研究
爱默生和莫斯科维奇是先驱
他们和其他学者都证明少数人
经常是一个人 如何实现重大改变
能实现显著的改变
爱默生说
"人类历史是少数派
和一个人的少数派的权力记录
很多社会科学研究支持这个观点
人类学家Margaret Mead说
"永远不要怀疑一小群
有思想 坚定的市民可以改变世界
事实上 正是这群人改变着世界"
所有改变从一个人或一小众人的思想开始
然后不断扩大
问题是"它如何扩大"
以及为什么我们难以理解
我们能够做出改变这个事实
并接受 被同化以及据此生活
如果我们能了解我们需要理解的
是改变如何发生
改变以指数级发生
我们与其他人的联系及他们与更多人的联系
形成了一个指数函数
可以用你们熟习的
"蝴蝶效应"为例加以解释
一只蝴蝶在新加坡拍动翅膀
理论上能在佛罗里达引起龙卷风
原因在于粒子的连续碰撞
它也解释了六度分隔理论
我们都是关联和相互关联的
在一个潜在善的网络里
为了说明人类网络的指数本质
我们来以笑为例
研究证明笑有传染性
别人笑会引起你发笑
你发笑会引起别人发笑
以此类推
即使路人与你擦身而过时 你没笑
表面上你没有笑
但你面部的细微肌肉
会收缩 让你感觉更好
笑是传染的
如果你的笑
感染了三个人
这三个人
每个人又引起另外三人发笑
那九个人
每个人再用笑容感染三个人
只需要20度的分隔
从你用笑容感染三个人开始
全世界就会笑起来
社会网络的指数本质
让别人感觉良好也有感染力
恭维别人
如果你能让三个人
甚至四个人度过美妙的一天
他们会推展 让四人有美好的一天
以此类推
只需要很短的时间
整个世界都会感觉更加美好
这是指数函数的本质
笑和笑声是传染的
为了说明这一点 我会插播一段录像
（西班牙语）
很难不笑 不是吗?
我要再看一遍
报歉
今天讲座的主题是婴儿
一会还有另外一段
让我们先理解指数函数的本质
以便理解"一"的力量
我想找个人和我作个交易
交易是这样的 我要做的是要求你们
00:11:09,060 --&gt; 00:11:10,000
纯属自愿
可以不做 交易是这样的
我要求你们每天给我…
还是我给你们吧
我给每个和我作交易的人
每天一千美元 连给30天
你们给我的是 第一天
一分钱
第二天 二分钱 第三天 四分钱
每天给我前一天的两倍钱
从一分钱开始
谁愿意和我作这笔交易？
我会在未来30天每天给你一千美元
你们要做的是在未来30天给我一分钱
第二天二分 然后是四分 八分 以此类推
任何人?谁想做这笔交易?
一个人
还有吗？
我少了三万美元
还有吗? 很好
好 是这样
结果将是这样
在第30天 我再给你一千美元
你将从我这里一共得到三万美元
在第30天 我将从你那里一共得到
包括前29天
不 在第30天
我将从你那里得到5368709.12美元
再翻倍 乘以二
这将是我在一个月赚到的钱
第一天一分钱 第二天二分钱…
很多人会觉得不可思议
因为他们不懂指数函数的本质
也不懂"一"的力量
再举一个例子
开玩笑的 我放过你
另一个例子 这个例子捕获了我的想象力
在我小的时候
父亲给我讲象棋游戏的由来
有些人可能知道这个故事
象棋游戏的发明人
他在印度 去见当地的国王
国王很喜欢这个游戏并说
"我要如何奖赏你?" 象棋发明者说
"不必 真得不用奖赏"
国王说"不 我想奖赏你
我要怎样奖赏你?"
于是象棋发明者说
"好吧 我希望
在第一个方格上
我想要一粒大米
在第二个方格上 我想要两粒大米
第三个方格四粒大米 以此类推
那就是我的要求"
国王问"你确定只想要那么多?
我可以给你更多奖赏
这是一个很好玩的游戏"
发明人说"我确定"
国王指示助手
去实现他的愿望
当他们开始计算
需要多少粒米填满所有方格时
从第二格到第63格
他们发现米粒
能厚厚地覆盖全世界
再一次 误导…
没有理解指数函数 因为我们不理解
237
指数变化的本质
最后一个例子
你们认为需要折多少次
你们面前都有一张纸
你们认为需要将纸折叠多少次
才能碰到月亮?
月亮离我们24万英里
需要折纸多少次
才能碰到月亮
41次
如果你们有一张纸
再在下课之前折叠41次
你就能碰到月亮
我不理解人类登月
有什么大不了的
在我看来很简单
得出的结论是
我们低估影响改变的能力
因为我们低估了指数函数的增长
我们活着的每分钟都在影响世界和他人
问题是我们选择哪个方向
是成为推动改变的力量?深思熟虑？
成为实践理想主义者?
还是只有好的意图但不付出
必要的努力发挥正面指数函数的作用
这门课的最后一份作业
是由你们做一次报告
选修和专修学生都要做
你们要准备一次讲座
我们在组织课堂时
心中就有这个想法
你如何影响改变 那些被你改变的人
希望能进一步影响其他人等等
从许多方面 此想法取自电影"让爱传出去"
我想插播一段片段
引出接下来的话题"让爱传出去"
为那些没看过电影的同学
电影"让爱传出去"
深刻地描述了
人类网络是指数函数的观点
我们低估了自己影响改变的能力
因为我们低估了指数函数的增长
如果世界只是个巨大的失望会怎样?
除非你把在这世上讨厌的事物
翻转过来 你们可以从今天开始
这是我
这是另外三个人
我准备帮助他们
他们每人再帮助三个人
再每人帮助三个人
但必须是很重大的帮助
他们无法自己做到的事
一个想法可能改变世界
车坏了?
很敏锐的观察力
我能帮你
你给我一辆崭新的捷豹但不要回报
你可以称为陌生人之间的慷慨解囊
你对我儿子说了什么
让他把一个流浪汉带回家?
我有新闻 相信我?
Chandling and Moss的高级合伙人往外送新车?
把爱传出去
帮三个人三个大忙
不可能把两个人放在一起令其彼此喜欢
就是它
把爱传出去
喜欢这个主意
你可以改变一个人
想进来留下吗?
这很复杂 进来
本来就该很困难
我不在乎你的烧伤
Eugene 如果那是你的顾虑
那是你顾虑吗?
我不能
我很难过
别说你有多为我难过
也许你害怕被拒绝
我无法拒绝你 你变得太快
你还会向外传递爱吗?
为了我 再给她一次机会
要来不急了
我想穿那条绿色的裙子
不 你很香
真的? 是的
"把爱传出去"是洛杉矶兴起的一场运动
别说笑 一场运动?
要是我们不改变世界 你会让我们不及格
你可能只得一个C
影响三个人
每个再影响三个 以此类推
经过20度分隔
就能改变世界 整个世界
第三个前提
内在因素和外在因素
很多研究表明
基于外在因素改变快乐很难
对幸福的研究
心理学家用这个词来描述快乐
已经进行了很多年
直至最近 多数完成的研究
使用的都是问卷方式
很多人置疑问卷的
真实性和价值
因为它是主观的
我们是在测量真实的东西吗?
过去几年
呈现的情况是越来越多心理学家
使用大脑扫描
使用功能性磁共振成像 脑电图及其他手段
他们的有趣发现是
两者有很大的关联性
在所谓的客观手段 如大脑扫描
脑电图 功能性磁共振成像等生理学手段
和人们对自己的幸福的评估
换言之即快乐的主观水平
两者有很大关联 这在很多方面
给多年来进行过的研究提供了可信度
在拥有技术进行更全面的研究之前
我会和大家分析讨论各种研究
有些使用大脑扫描
其他是自我评估
两者同样有意义有价值
我们会深入讨论研究的进行方式
当我们谈到冥想等现象
或像是Richie Davidson 通过扫描大脑
显示八周的冥想项目
可以产生重要改变
或年轻的Joshua Greene
他对道德进行研究
显示大脑里有道德中心
手段更成熟
370
更有趣 有趣的是
它验证了许多至今通过不全面的方法
所完成的研究的正确性
像自我评估
Daniel Gilbert所作的研究
他教初级心理学的"有效预测"
以下是他的一个研究
他所做的是去访问
接受终身职位审核前的教授
他们要么得到要么得不到
380
他问他们"你会多快乐
如果你得到终身职位?"
他们说"喜出望外
这是我多年努力的目标
这将会是
将是梦想成真"
"你会快乐多久?"
他们说"余生都会很快乐
因为这是我们努力很久的目标
它会让一切变得更简单
我可以停止不成功便成仁的竞争
我可以更加享受工作
这将改变我的人生"
他问他们"如果得不到终身职位会怎样?
如果被拒绝呢?"
他们说"我们会很难过
这是我们多年来努力的目标"
"那你们会痛苦多久?"
"可能直到我们在别处获得终身职位
即使到了那时 可能也不够"
如果在一所学校无法获得终身职位
就没有可能在更高学府取得
经常是在别的院校获得
那些比拒绝你的学院
差一等的院校
所以那会让人难过很久
Gilbert再去访问他们
这时他们已知道终身职位审核结果
有些得到 有些没得到
他问"你们感觉如何?"
得到的说
"喜出望外 我们没从这样快乐过"
"你们的快乐会持续多久?"
"余生都会倍感快乐
我们成功了"
然后他去找没得到终身职位的并问
"你们感觉如何?"
他们很难过
而且确信
会难过好久
三个月后 他再去访问他们
六个月后再去
Gilbert和他的同事发现
几乎每一个人
不管得到还是没得到终身职位
都恢复到之前的幸福水平
如果他们之前是快乐的
六个月后也是快乐的
如果他们之前是不快乐的
不管他们是否得到终身职位
他们都是不快乐的
换言之 情形看似这样 然后回到基础水平
或者看似这样 然后回到基础水平
他们对中彩票的人做了同样的研究
"如果你真得中了一千万美元
00:25:03,690 --&gt; 00:25:06,340
真得能让你更快乐吗?"
是的 更快乐一段时间并不长久
西北大学的Philip Brickman做了这个研究
经过六个月
人们恢复基础的幸福水平
遇到严重意外的人
意外导致瘫痪
经常地 一般性的…
再次强调 这是平均而言
都会恢复到基础幸福水平
00:25:32,940 --&gt; 00:25:34,330
他们以前是快乐的
一年后 他们也会快乐
如果不快乐 将维持不快乐
极端情况对我们的幸福影响很小
伊利诺伊大学教授Ed Diener
就快乐水平作了大量研究
他自70年代开始研究
他的研究显示…
他和其他人 包括诺奖得主Daniel Kahneman
表明财富对幸福水平的影响很小
就像中了彩票
对我们是否幸福影响甚微
并不是说一个没有足够食物
一个无家可归 流落街头的人
每个月多有一两千美元
那当然会让他或她更快乐
但超出基本需要后
当我们的基本需要得到满足 即有食物
住所 基础教育
这些需要一旦得到满足
收入的影响就微乎其微
几代人之间没有变化
我们这一代比父辈富足
比祖父辈更加富足
我们不是更快乐
这是全球现象
不论是中国 英国还是澳大利亚
或美国
幸福水平几乎是静止的
焦虑水平和抑郁水平
正如第一堂课讲到的 有明显的加深
收入水平的影响很小
总得来说 外部环境的影响很小
回想你们的亲身经验
你们感觉如何
回想自己
考入哈佛时的体会
信箱里收到一个大包写着"已录取"
在4月1日或12月未
当你拿到大包时
有何感受? 可能是喜出望外
可能是你人生的亮点
在那一刻 如果你们像我一样
你们也会想"成功了
我会快乐很长一段时间
因为我在高中很努力
很多时很困难
很多时很痛苦 但完全值得
我考上了哈佛"
第二天 你还会有这种感觉
因为学校的人开始谈论你如何考上
你感觉很棒 不是吗?
可能整个高三都会感觉很棒
当然难免起起落落
但总是来说是高水平的快乐
这种快乐将持续一生
来到这里 经过新生周
你知道快乐会持续一生
因为身边都是杰出的人
大学生活很丰富 派对不断
你说"人们对哈佛的想法都错了
这里其实是个派对大学"
你们很确定这一点 不是吗?
不仅是个派对大学
而且未来四年甚至以后 都会过得很快乐
因为你的人生被这封录取信改变
没错吧?
事情也许从开课第一天就发生变化
但没有完全不同
因为这是购物期 妙不可言的阶段
你们选择课程
比去商场更过瘾
有三千门课程任你挑选
在哈佛的第二周妙不可言
这种情况将持续下去
余生将是一浪高于一浪的快乐
事情突然开始发生变化
轻微地 非常轻微地
要写第一篇论文时 情况彻底改变
或期中考试来临时
你恢复基础幸福水平
如果你在高中
初中时经历过很大压力而且不快乐
一般来说最好的预言家会说
在哈佛呆上一个月 你会有同样的感觉
外部环境影响甚微
00:30:01,460 --&gt; 00:30:07,250
同样地 居住地的影响也很小
人们会想"如果我搬到
尤其是在白天
要是搬去加州 我会更快乐?" 错误
加州人不比麻省人更快乐
刚去到一个温暖的地方
会感到放松 幸福水平高到值峰
但很快我们会恢复基础水平
和以前的我们一模一样
我会进一步说明
虽然还没有这方面的研究
我敢和你们打赌 下面的说法是正确的
我们的幸福水平不会有所不同
不论我们是生活在河边
还是呆在quad （哈佛举行毕业典礼等重大集会的地方）
这个例子把理论推至极限 但是真的
我喜欢这件衬衫 什么?
不能和大狗一起跑就呆在院子里
这里有韩国学生吗?好的
你在这么冷的日子赶来
很出色 我很感激
我们真是受宠若惊 不会有所不同
微乎甚微的区别
我们在哪里 我们生活在哪里
收入水平 是否中彩票 是否取得终身职位
入读理想中大学
找到理想工作 大四学生
可能已经找到
没错 你们会感觉极至的幸福
我肯定拿到录取信时
你们的幸福感也达到峰值
但很快又恢复到基础水平
对基础幸福水平很重要的一样东西
它是一个外在因素 那就是民主和压迫
生活在民主制度下的人通常明显
比生活在独裁制度下的人更快乐
以女性为例
生活在压迫制度下的一般
没有生活在自由国家的女性快乐
生活在达尔福尔的人
571
肯定没有生活在丹麦或美国的人快乐
这些是能产生区别的
极端情况
比如我举的无家可归者的例子
收入当然会改善他的境遇
移民到自由国家
当然会让他们更加幸福
但在这些极端情况之外
增加或减少的外部环境
产生的区别很小
这即是好消息也是坏消息
坏消息是 看来不论我们怎么做
都无关紧要
我为什么还要努力争取好工作？
我为什么要拼命入读这所学校
如果这些都无关紧要 总要经历高低潮?
答案是
是的 它不会改变我们的幸福水平
但并不意味着
我们不能提升自己的幸福水平
很多人说
一般的快乐或不快乐水平
是由于人们有过高的期望
如果能降低期望
降低压力水平 我们会更享受生活
我不在乎成绩是不是B
不在乎会让我更快乐
如果我降低期望水平
我不在乎从事什么工作
只想快乐
你可能会快乐
降低期望水平会略微快乐些
但从长远来说行不通
下周我们会谈到这个问题
长远来说行不通
问题不在于是否降低那些高的期望
这一点不重要
问题在于正确和错误的期望
而不是低的和高的期望
那不会影响我们的幸福水平
能影响幸福水平的
是我们的期望是正确还是错误
错误的期望认为进入某间公司
获得升职
找到理想的伴侣
就能让自己更快乐
搬去加州或哈默堡
这本身不会让我们更快乐
那是错误的期望
正确的期望是相信内在的改变
这些事情不会让我们快乐
事实上 我们的准备和体验幸福的可能性
主要由我们的心境决定
不是我们的地位或银行账户状况
我们要改变我们的认知 心境
要改变我们对世界的诠释
以及我们的遭遇 成就 失败
重要的是我们选择领悟什么
精力集中的焦点是什么
重要的是转变
而不是外部信息或外部成功
1504这门课程的重点
是关于转变
正如我在第一课中提到的
我想进入第四个前提
这堂课最重要的一个前提
在很多方面
我们能理解人类智力发展历史
仅仅基于这个观点
应不应该接受人类本性?
我们能否完善它?
00:36:14,120 --&gt; 00:36:15,990
它能否改变?
这个工作或者说这些观点
基于Thomas Sowell的成果
Thomas Sowell 哈佛58届学生
目前就职斯坦福的胡佛研究院
我心中的一位知识分子英雄
他的工作和作品的贡献在于解释了
人们为什么会选择一个党派反对另一个
为什么会选择一种生活方式摒弃另一种
这本书帮助我更好地了解自己
652
更好地了解别人
不论是政治上
心理上还是哲学观上
对政治感兴趣的同学
如果说有一本书是必读的
读完Marva Collins的作品后 就是这本
Thomas Sowell所执的观点是什么？
他把人分成两个阵营
那些认为本性受约束
有局限性的观点的人
和认为人性不受约束
无局限性的观点的人
认为人性受约束的观点的人
相信人性无法改变
它是永恒的 我们有一些本能
有一些欲望
它们是固有的 无法改变
是什么样就是什么样
作为人的物种
只有与生俱来的东西
我们的缺陷不可避免
无法改变
不论好坏 我们只能接受
我们只能接受缺陷
执有人性受约束的观点的人认为
我们的本能 欲望
我们的本性是永恒的 唯有接受
但他们没有屈服 而是加以引导
如何引导?
通过建立某种政治机构
引导有缺陷的
不完美的人性向好的方面发展
执有这种观点的
哲学家和心理学家创造了它们
创建了人生哲学 心理学 各种机构和体系
00:38:27,380 --&gt; 00:38:31,840
来引导我们有缺点的不完美的人性
在哲学史上认为人性受约束的人
包括汉密尔顿 亚当斯密
学习经济学的都耳熟能详
Fredrick Kayak等
这些人认为
"我们的本性是受约束的
是有局限的" Edmund Burke说的
最准确阐述这种观点的
是培根的话
他是17世纪时科学运动之父
是一名哲学家
"号令自然 必须遵守自然"
不论是物质本质还是人性本质
我们都需要遵守它
本质是不变的
还有人性不受约束的观点
也许你更乐观
更加乐天 人性可以改善
可以改变
取决于我们去不去做 本性可以完善
不需要接受缺陷不可避免的观点
可以完善它
有办法解决这些缺陷
完善不完美的地方 我们的职责
机构的目标
不论是政治机构
教育机构 各种体系
各种组织 个体哲学家 心理学家
职责都是改变人类本性
完善它 把它变得更好
致力于此的哲学家
有托马斯杰斐逊
卢梭
萧伯纳 德沃金及其他杰出思想家
Thomas Sowell的贡献是
绘制了整个世界智力发展历史
展示出人们执有不同观点
两种截然不同的政治观点
最好地阐述了本性受约束观点的人
法国哲学家政治家Benjamin Constant说
"命运召唤我们进行自我完善"
执本性受约束观点的人
是在政治上 并非总是
但一般都是支持资本主义的人
比如亚当斯密
开创了"不可见的手"的理论
把不完美 有缺陷的本性导向好的
执本性不受约束观点的人
倾向乌托邦主义或共产主义
并非总是 有时是
为什么？让我们来改变人类本性
自利不是好事
长远来说是有害的 所以
我们需要改变它 而认为本性受约束的人
他们会说
"我们也许不是那样 但本性难移
不能改变它
我们尽去完善它 把它导向好的"
两种皆然不同的观点
基于人的观念得到两种皆然不同的手段
我为什么要给你们讲这个?
这不是政治科学课程
因为它与心理学息息相关
它与心理学息息相关
我们认识了现实吗
对人类本性执不同观点
最终将影响我们心理
这是非常有意义和重要的
我来解释
首先
有些人在政治上执受约束的观点
但在心理学上执不受约束观点
并不总是一致
但多数时是一致的
这门课提倡的心理学观点
是本性受约束观点
换言之 那是我相信的观点
我会用三个研究加以证明 从今天开始
直到下个学期
人类本性是固有的
我们有欲望
我们有生而有之的本能
或上天赐与或经几百万年
在进化中形成
这些本性不会很快改变
在有生之年是不可能的
它是固有的
不论好坏 我们都要接受它们
在接受这个本性后 我们唯一能做的
是通过研究首先来理解它
理解它后
好好地利用它
通过研究 探究
通过内省来理解它
然后好好地利用
如何引导我的本性?
现在我想演示一个案例研究
说明我所谓的本性受约束的含义
为何它对快乐
幸福 长久的成功如此重要
当论及到我们的心理时
人性受约束观点很重要
我谈及的话题是准许为人
原因有三
第一 它说明了Thomas Sowell的观点
在心理学领域的政治方面
第二 因为我认为它是
快乐和幸福的最重要支柱之一
第三个原因
因为它引起人们
对何为积极心理学的误解
当我开始教授这门课时
有六名学生
我记得有一天坐在学生宿舍里
独自用餐 一名学生走进来说
"能一起吃吗?""当然" 我们共进午餐
他对我说
"Tal 我听说你教一门有关快乐的课程"
我对他说"是的 没错"
他说"我的室友选了你的课"
我说"那太好了"
六名学生中有了两名
他说"Tal 你现在要多加小心"
我问"为什么?"
他说"Tal 你必须小心"
我说"为什么?"
他说"因为如果我见到你不快乐
我会告诉他们"
第二天上课时
我讲了这件事并对学生说
"我最不希望你们以为
我总是保持快乐 或者你们
在期未或学年未
那门课程要讲一年
你们到学年未时
会一直保持快乐"
只有两类人
体会这种持续的快乐
不会体会到痛苦的情绪 像愤怒
嫉妒 失望
悲伤 不快乐
抑郁或偶尔的焦虑
两类人不会体会到这些痛苦的情绪
一类是精神病人
因此不会感受到痛苦的情绪
第二类
没有痛苦情绪体会的 是死人
没错 所以
如果你们体会到这些情绪
那是个好兆头
说明你不是精神病人 也还没死
然而在当今的文化中
我们不准许自己为人
也没有体会痛苦情绪的自由
我们为这种无能付出高昂代价
为拒绝接受
本性受约束
生而有之的事实 付出高昂代价
孩子和婴儿
回到婴儿期
我们准许自己为人
我们知道那是自然的
事实上根本不去思考
自然而然地经历起起落落
后来当我们停止准许自己为人时
当我们的“面子”变得重要起来的时候
当我们开始发觉其他人在看我们时
时刻评价我们时
856
人们远没我们以为的那么注意我们
那时我们停止准许自己为人
为此我们付出代价 包括精力水平
幸福感 快乐感
创造力 最终以成就大小作为代价
我举一个
准许自己为人的例子
准许为人
不是说大家应该像那样
我的意思是我们都需要一个空间
生活中要有一个地方
在那里我们准许自己为人
可以是和挚友在一起时
我们关心的人
最重要的是面对自己时
写日记时
这时我们准许自己为人
准许自己哭泣 快乐
如果不那么做
我们付出代价
我们需要一个无条件接受自我的地方
我得到的最好建议
或者说是我们
是我妻子和我 当David
我们的大儿子出生时 Tok Shapiro医生给的
David在凌晨一点出生
早上八点时
他来查看我妻子的情况
查看婴儿的情况
不知为什么 他没询问我的情况
一切都正常
在他走出房间时
他转过身说
"还有一件事
在接下来的几个月里
你们将体会到每一种情绪
极至的情绪 那没关系
是很自然的事
我们都经历过"
然后他走了出去
这是妻子和我
得到的关于抚育孩子的最好建议
为什么？让我举个例子
一个月后
我开始偶尔
对David产生一种嫉妒
因为这是妻子和我在一起后
第一次有人夹在中间
另一个人比我获得更多的关注
不管我怎么哭
我嫉妒他 然后五分钟后
我对他产生最强烈的爱意
一种我从没感受过的情绪
平时我会想
"真是个伪君子
事情不对劲
前一分钟充满嫉妒 转眼体会无尽爱意?"
这完全合情合理
完全正确
这是为人的一部分
因为我脑子里装着儿科医生的建议
准许为人
那帮了我很多
我体会嫉妒 接受它
然后享受和赞美
我对David产生的积极情绪
准许为人
这里有自相矛盾的地方
Daniel Wegner对"反语处理"做过研究
当我们压抑一种自然现象时
那种现象只会加强
我用一个实验加以说明
在接下来的十秒钟里
不要想粉色大象
在接下来的十秒钟里不要想粉色大象
知道我说的是什么吗？
就是大耳朵的小飞象?
00:51:36,130 --&gt; 00:51:39,570
在接下来的十秒钟里不要想粉色大象
我肯定没有人想一头粉色大象 是吗?
事实如何?多数人都会想粉色大象
因为当我们企图压抑一种自然现象时
比如提起一个词时浮现出相应形象
只会加强它
压抑自然的痛苦情绪也有此效果
企图压制它们时 它们会加强
当我听说Marva Collins的事迹
并决定以教书为终身职业时
943
我知道必须克服一个问题
那就是我个性内性
站在听众前面我会很紧张 对我来说
超过五个人就算众多听众
但我必须克服这个问题
948
我知道必须克服它
所以我会站在听众面前 在那之前
我会对自己说
"不要紧张
不要焦虑
今天不能焦虑
不要紧张
不要紧张 不要"
事实又是怎样?
我即紧张又焦虑
但在读过 Victor Frankl
有关"矛盾意向"的阐述后
我开始准许自己为人
现在当我去上课时 紧张感
因为我准许自己为人
在课堂进行三小时后会消失
但紧张是可以控制的
每次上课前 我仍会感觉紧张
其实这是件好事 它可以控制
我能应付它 能控制它
准许为人
拒绝本性导致次优表现
不论在情绪上还是外在表现
想象每天早上醒来后对自己说
"我拒绝接受万有引力定律
万有引力定律很麻烦
要被迫上下楼
我只想早上时飘去剧院
我只想下午时飘去餐厅
更加容易 更少痛苦"
想象过这样一种生活
你真的能拒绝接受万有引力定律吗?
那会是怎么一样生活?
首先 你可能活不长
如果你不接受
人会从半空中掉下来的事实
即使你幸存下来
比如你在一楼
就算你真的幸存下来
你的生活将是处处受挫
拒绝接受现实事物
不论你喜欢与否
所以我们接受万有引力定律
不仅如此 我们利用定律发明游戏
你们中喜欢运动的
教室里多数人都做运动
跑步时需要万有引力定律
你能想象哈佛和耶鲁
在没有万有引力的情况下进行橄榄球赛吗?
你能想象没有万有引力情况下的篮球赛吗?
我不是在说乔丹 而是普通人
我们接受它 并利用它发明游戏
然而说到情绪时 我们却不这么做
这是关键点
人类本性的痛苦情绪
一如物理世界的万有引力定律
"号令自然 必须遵守自然"
航空航天工程师
想制造飞机 必须遵守
加以考虑 学习
研究理解万有引力定律
心理学家也是如此
人类本性受约束的观点
号令自然 必须遵守自然
然而我们却不那么做
我们的文化不那么做
为此我们付出高昂代价
我们正在经历我所谓的"大骗局"
我们是那种嘴上说"你好吗?"
嘴上说"很好 棒极了"
事实上我们不是那么好
更合适的回应是"我正经历不顺
恰逢困境 我很难受"
然而我们不想承认事实
我们不准许自己为人
因为我们觉得是自己有毛病
如果我们有这样的情绪
每个人都说
"很好 棒极了 妙不可言"
当我们被问到"你好吗?"时
我才不要作唯一的扫把星
我才不要作唯一的丧气鬼
于是我说"很好 棒极了"
就这样我们帮忙壮大了这个大骗局
正是这个大骗局导致严重的抑郁
严重的抑郁是快乐付出的终极代价
这很好地解释了
为什么今天有那么多人
感到抑郁 达到45%
全国大学校园都如此
没有足够的"准许为人"
我不是说要我们肆无忌惮地表达情绪
有人走向我们
在William James大厅的电梯里
我说"你好吗?"
00:57:13,890 --&gt; 00:57:14,880
"感谢关心
这得从我三岁时说起"
我不是这个意思
在William James大厅也许会遇到这种事
因为那部电梯
运作得太慢
但不是那样
我不是那个意思
我的意思是一个空间
生活中的私密空间 和挚友一起时
和家人在一起时 最重要的是面对自己时
我们要准许自己为人
我说的不是屈从
远远不是那样 不是说
"我很抑郁 这是毫无办法的事
我接受我的本性
接受我的状态
就这样吧"
我说的不是屈从
我说的是主动接受
那是什么意思?
它意味着理解有些事
我无法改变 有些事我能而且应该去改变
我们会集中讨论的一点是"差别"
在有关"改变"的课上中会着重谈
情感 行为和认知的差别
心理学的ABC
情感代表情绪 行为代表行动
认知代表思想
无条件地接受
准许为人 主要与情感相关
与情绪相关
它们是现实存在 就像万有引力定律
那不代表我们要接受我们的行为和认知
举个例子 我可以…
因为以前的经历
嫉妒我最好的朋友
那种情绪本身不代表我是个坏人
这是人类本性
我从没遇到过任何一个
从来没有或没有体会过…
也许达赖喇嘛可以
除了他
谁都嫉妒过别人
如果说达赖喇嘛真的无欲无求
那也是修行几十年的结果
嫉妒是人性的一部分
嫉妒没有好坏之分
愤怒也无好坏之分
抑郁和焦虑也无好坏之分
那是人性的一部分
问题在于
我要选择怎样的行为
去表达情感？
道德在此介入
00:59:57,810 --&gt; 01:00:01,
我可以选择道德和不道德的行为
对待最好的朋友 孩子或一般人
我仍会嫉妒最好的朋友
但选择对他宽容和亲切
认知也是如此 我们会深入讨论认知
当谈到认知行为治疗时
我可以感受它
但不代表
我要屈从于对那种感受的想法
我们会频繁谈到沉思
其实沉思痛苦的情绪
没有多大帮助
书写描述更有帮助
向别人倾诉更有帮助
要胜过总是想着
被女朋友甩了多么的惨
我还没在快餐店找到新目标
沉思没有帮助
我没有必要接受
所有不理智的想法
下周我们会更深入地探讨
如何认知性地重塑自己的想法
但情绪 情感即情绪
是无法改变的
重要的是要真实面对现实
这也是本门课的重要主题之一
从很多方面来说这门课不该叫"积极心理学"
我在你们选了这门课后才挑明
想退课也晚了
这门课不是讲"积极心理学"
而是一门"现实心理学"课程
因为积极心理学可能表示
我们只聚焦于积极的起作用的部分
忽略其余不起作用的
我们要做的就像是改变钟摆幅度
比起21比1的比率 两方更均衡
我们做得更多 除了专注于积极的一面
与此同时
也认同痛苦的情绪
和美好的情绪一样都是人性的组成
我们越早接受越好
那并不代表在1504课程结束后
或修读完另外100门课程
然后就可以把读过的书丢了
并不是说 你就不会再感受到痛苦的情绪
只是你的心理免疫系统会变得更强
希望在本学期未就见成效
心理免疫系统会变得更强
那不表示我们不再得病
而是意味着我们更有抵抗力 即使得病
也能很快康复
极其快乐的人和极其不快乐的人
区别不是在于一个会伤心
难过 焦虑或抑郁
而另一个不会
两类人都会
区别在于他们能够多么迅速
多么快速地从痛苦情绪中恢复过来
换言之 我们的心理免疫系统有多强
我们的心理免疫系统会加强
当我们准许自己为人时
很多同学可能读到过这首诗
听说过这首诗 它非常好地阐述了
主动接受含义的基础
它已成为AA运动的正式圣言
"主啊 请赐我安详 接纳我不能改变的事物
请赐我勇气 去改变我可以改变的东西
并赐我智慧去认识这两者的差别"
认识两者差别的智慧
幸运的是 这样的智慧可以通过学习获得
通过研究和在这个学期
进行的深刻反省中获得
现在我想做个练习
我想做一次群体冥想
希望你们理解
不只是在研究的认知层面上
还要在内心情感层面上去体会
准许自己为人的真正含义
感觉不自在的
可以不参与
认为没问题的 一起来做
如果你觉得很勉强
我仍建议你一起来
如果你从没冥想过
这是你们尝试的好机会
我对你们的一个要求是
如果你不做
不参与的同学
请保持安静
此外 我强烈建议你参与
现在我要大家一起
一起进入无条件接受境界
在座位上尽量坐直身体
如果可以 后背在靠背上放松
双脚舒服地放在地板上
感觉舒适 闭上双眼
转移呼吸的焦点
把思想的焦点 转移到呼吸上
向腹部深深吸气
然后呼气
再一次深深吸气
缓慢 平稳 安静地呼气
安静地重复呼吸
如果走神了 回到呼吸上
深深缓慢地吸气
深深缓慢 平稳 安静地呼气
多数人吸气的深度不够
我们没时间赞美我们的呼吸
我们的精神 我们的存在
联系 关联
心灵与身体的桥梁
情绪和思想的桥梁
脑和心的桥梁
继续深呼吸
继续深呼吸的同时
将焦点转向情绪 转向感受
你们好吗？
感觉如何？
注意你的情绪
不论是怎样的情绪 不论感觉到什么
让它流过你的全身 自然地
体会那种情绪
你可能先体会到一种情绪
然后又体会到另一种 这没关系
不论是怎么情绪 接受它
体会它
准许自己为人
都没关系 呼吸
继续观察体会出现的情绪
不管是平静或快乐
不管是焦虑 困惑 无聊或喜悦
不管它是什么
继续向腹部深呼吸
平稳 缓慢 安静地呼气
让那种情绪像呼吸一样流动
随着呼吸的加深
01:11:00,960 --&gt; 01:11:02,640
用你的心眼
看自己走出这间教室
走在校园里
体会你的所有感受
都是人性的一部分
它们在那里
不论好坏
在你走在建筑物和树木之间时
在你看到朋友和同学时
让那些情绪流遍你的全身
自由地 轻盈地
通过体会这些情绪
不论是起是落
你正在做的是
作一个人
继续让呼吸和情绪流动
任其流动
如果你真的能准许自己为人呢?
如果你真的准许自己为人呢?
放飞想象
生命变得更加轻盈
更加简单
不是想办法战斗打败我们的本性
我们接受它
我们接受自己
我们接受出现的一切情绪
深深 缓慢地吸气
缓慢 平稳 安静 平静地呼气
安静地深呼吸几次
拥抱这份安静 静止
拥护你自己 你的情绪
下次呼气
1266
深深 缓慢 安静地呼气
睁开你的眼睛
如果你身边的人睡着了
轻轻地把他或她唤醒
放飞想象
想象你将体验怎样的生活
你将拥有怎样的生活
如果你真的
准许自己为人
它是健康人生的支柱之一
不论是心理上还是身体上
试试吧
每天提醒自己一两次
准许自己为人
同样也准许别人这样做
你们应得的
周四见
