Lovinger看看我们能怎么分解自尊的基本构成to see how we can perhaps break down self-esteem into its components这就是我的论文的内容that's what my dissertation did也是我上节课跟大家讲的内容this is what I presented to you in the previous class基本上就是讲了自尊这个领域里的研究人员的观点basically take the ideas of the select field researchers那些思考这个问题的人who had been thinking about it例如马路对面的教育学院的Robert Keganpeople like Robert Kegan across the road from the Ed school他研究自尊的角度更倾向于发展心理学thinking about self-esteem more developmentally我给大家介绍了那个渐成模型 渐成And I presented the epigenetic model – epigenetic再说一次 它的意思就是必须实现了一层once again, meaning that one level has to be fulfilled或者至少部分实现了一层 才能去到下一层or at least partly fulfilled before we can go the next level128这三层分别是依赖型自尊And the three levels are dependent self-esteem独立型自尊independent self-esteem和无条件型自尊and unconditional self-esteem依赖型自尊 它有两个构成部分Dependent self-esteem - the two components of it首先first of all有高度依赖性自尊的人时刻需要他人的赞扬person with high dependence needs the accolades of others constantly不管是选择职业 还是决定下午做什么这样的小事chooses whether it's a career path or what to do this afternoon都是根据他人的认同来做决定的based on how much approval that will gain him or her有依赖型自尊的人Person with dependent self-esteem在能力感方面when it comes to competence总是拿自己跟别人比较always compares him or herself to others我比他们好还是差? 比他们优秀还是不如他们?Am I better or am I worse? Superior or inferior?独立型自尊是一种取决于自我的自尊Independent self-esteem is self-esteem that's contingent on the self这样的人在评价自己时in terms of how I evaluate myself用的是自己的意见that's my internal voice that's speaking他们的能力感取决于In terms of how my levels of competence are determined自己认为自己进步了多少it depends on how much I have improved改善了多少how much better I've got觉得自己的潜力发挥了多少how much I feel that I have fulfilled my potential这就是独立型自尊That's independent self-esteem并不取决于他人的言论或想法not contingent on what other people say or think无条件型自尊是最高层次的自尊Unconditional self-esteem is the highest level也就是Maslow所说的"自我实现"the level that Maslow would talk about - "the self-actualization"David Schnarch所说的"分化良好型"what David Schnarch talks about as "differentiated"想被了解 而不是被认可or at the level of being known rather than desiring to be validated无条件型自尊是指我们的自尊高到Unconditional self-esteem is when our self-esteem is high enough让我们对自己感觉很好we feel good enough about ourselves所以我们并不在乎别人怎么看自己not to be concerned with evaluations with others甚至不在乎自己怎么看自己or even with self evaluations在比较方面In terms of comparison我们不会比较 我们是相互依存的we don't compare; we are inter-dependent相互联系的connected to others我上节课举的一个例子是写书So the example that I gave last time is of a book假设我出版一本书 我是一个高度依赖型自尊的人Let's say I publish a book and I have high dependent self-esteem首先 我写这本书First of all, I write it我出版这本书 是为了得到赞扬I publish it so that I can get accolades我的首要动机是获得外界认同My primary motivation is external approval我的首要动机是想出版一本My primary motivation is wanting to bring out a book比别人的书都好的书that will be better than the other books out there相比较而获得的能力感 以及取决于外界so relative competence as well as externally other-determined又假设我写了一本书So if I bring in a book and write a book我是一个高度独立型自尊的人and I have high independent self-esteem我写了书 我自己评价I write it and I evaluate it myself"这是一本好书"或者"这本书不怎么样"this is good work, " or "this is not so good需要修改"needs improvement在比较方面In terms of comparison我跟自己比较 "我比起刚开始写时进步了很多I compare to myself - "I've improved a lot since I started writing这本书比我之前一本要好This book is actually better than my previous book我的书写得更真实了"My work has become more authentic, more real. "这是独立型自尊的评价That's independent self-esteem evaluation无条件型自尊Unconditional self-esteem是我们所知的最高层次自尊the highest level that we know of:我写了一本书 我不在乎评价I write a book and I'm not concerned about evaluation不管它是好是坏 我当然想变得越来越好whether it's good or bad - of course I want to be better and better但这并不影响我对自己的感觉but that doesn't affect how I feel about myself我就是我I simply exist我写了这本书 我处于心流状态I write the book; I'm in a state of flow我体验这种经历experiencing the experience至于这本书是不是比别人的好In terms of whether it's better than others或者比我以前写的好or better than I've written这都不重要it doesn't matter我高兴的是What I'm happy about我写成了一本书what makes me happy is bringing a good book into existence如果别人也写了一本书And I would be as happy我也会同样替他感到高兴if someone else wrote the book193别人写了一本更好的书 我会同样高兴 甚至更高兴I'd be as happy or happier that someone else wrote a better book这本书更能帮助到人that can help others more这个模型有很重要的一点是需要明白的Important thing to understand about this model我们从很小的年纪开始就有这三层自尊the three levels is that we all have all three basically from a very young age并非只有达赖喇嘛或特蕾沙修女It's not that the Dalai Lama or Mother Teresa曼德拉或者玛格丽特米德or Nelson Mandela or Margaret Mead这样的名人that people who we know have been才是自我实现的人are self-actualized他们并不是不在乎别人的看法it's not that they don't care about what other people say但他们However, they are mostly大部分时候most of their lives, most of the time都是自己决定的 做自己相信的事self-determined - do what they believe in和他人相互联系feel a sense of connection to others想让世界变得更美好want to make the world a better place但他们并非不在乎But it's not that they don't care并非他们评价自己时不会跟自己比较it's not that they don't evaluate themselves relative to themselves也不会跟他人比较or relative to others这是人的天性That's part of human nature我犯过一个错误 当我开始这个研究时My error, when I started with this research我跟自己说was that I said to myself"好的 我想有独立型自尊""OK,I just want to have independent当后来我明白无条件型自尊是什么时and later when I understood what unconditional self-esteem我说"我想有无条件型自尊"I said, "Wel, I want to have unconditional self-esteem."我把这两种自尊列为好的And I situated those two on the good side把依赖型自尊列为坏的and dependent self-esteem, bad结果呢?And what then happened?只加剧了我对他人的依赖It only intensified my dependency on others因为当我们有违天性时Because when we fight nature天性就会跟我们作对 我们赢不了nature fights back and we can't win就像第二节课一样You know, it's like going back to the second class如果我跟自己说If I say to myself"Tal 别紧张 别紧张 别心急""Tal, don't be nervou, Don't be nervo, Don't be anxiou."结果呢? 我看到粉红色大象出来了What happens? The pink elephants begin to come out我变得更焦虑更紧张了And I become even more anxious and more nervous但当我接受这种天性时whereas I accept it is part of my nature放任它 不强求自己Let it be – permission to be human它就顿时威力大减It loses a lot of its vitality and force and control因为我可以说Cause I can say"好的 这个人不喜欢我的书 我无所谓"OK. Yes, I care that this person didn't like my book不喜欢我的课 无所谓"didn't like my class我接受它 这是天性 我会伤心And I accepted it, It's nature, It hurts me我当然想他们都喜欢I would much rather that they all like it但转念一想 我就想通了But I can move on then, and said"我要怎样做才能活出自我?"OK,what would the most authentic life that I can lead?我作为一个老师要怎样才能被了解How can I the teacher who is known as opposed而不是整天想着得到别人的认同?"to constantly concerned about validation?"积极接受 回顾一下Active acceptance. Revisited接受我的天性 然后决定Accepting my nature and then deciding最合适的做法是什么what would the most appropriate action to take我的榜样之一是Warren BennisOne of the, my role models is Warren BennisWarren Bennis在领导才能这个领域Warren Bennis has done a lot of research and a lot of speaking做过很多研究 演讲和工作and a lot of work in the area of leadership他先在南加州大学教旁听课He teaches audit in University of Southern California后来才来哈佛和麻省理工was before he was at Harvard and MIT他来哈佛商学院教了三年And he came to Harvard Business School for three years第一年 作为一个客座教授and the first year - as a visiting professor第一年我上了他的班The first year I took his class一次非常特别的经历which was an extraordinary experience第二年他教那个班时The second year when he taught it我当了他的助教I was his teaching assistant我经常和他一起工作 互动And I used to work a lot with him and interact with him我经常为Warren折服and was constantly amazed by WarrenWarren当时80岁 他现在83岁了Warren, at the time was 80 years old - now he's 他走进教室时 整间教室都亮了起来would walk into the room and the room would light up他的微笑 姿势 直率It was his smile, his posture, his openness他丰富的表达his expressiveness都是为了和同学发生互动was there about his interacting with people他的一举一动让其他人and making the other person just by being there对自己感觉更好了feel better about themselves他自信坚强And he was confident and strong我把这样的人视为自我实现的人and what I would classify as self-actualized as a person他有很高的无条件自尊with very high unconditional self-esteem我们走得很近 他在很多方面都给了我帮助And we became very close and he helped me in many areas最大的帮助就是他活出自我 我观察他most of all just by being himself - me observing him学习他 吸收他给这个世界带来的东西learning from him, assimilating what he had to give the world吸收他每天给数百万读他的书的人and what he was giving day in and day out听他演讲的人to thousands and millions of people who have read his books和他有过接触的人who have been to his lectures所带来的知识who've had the privilege of interacting with him几年后 有一天And one day after a couple of years我是他的助教I was his TA我们关系很亲近and we were close我跟他说I said to him"Warren 你是怎么变成现在这样的?""Warren, how is it that you are like this?"你是怎么变成现在这样的?How is it that you are like this?他的回应时 把手放在我肩膀And his response was put his hand on my shoulder看着我 带着一个平静looked at me with his calm接受 慷慨的微笑 说accepting, giving smile, and said"Tal 我不是一出生就这样的""Tal. I wasn't always like this"他就只说了这一句And that's where he left it这就是我需要听到的答案And this is what I needed to hear因为在他的回答里Because in his response有很多重要的信息where two very important - many more而最重要的两个信息是but two very important messages第一个 他是慢慢进步成这样的the first message is that it evolves需要时间 你不会在20岁时 或者40岁时it takes time; you don't become third level一夜之间 去到第三层自尊self-actualized individual overnight at the age of 变成一个自我实现的人or even at the age of 需要时间 需要下功夫It takes time; it takes work; it takes self-awareness需要一次次跌倒和站起来it takes falling down and getting up学会失败learning to fail然后从失败中学习then learning from that failure需要学习接受自己It takes learning to accept oneself需要敞开心扉 接受伤害 犯错it takes being open and being vulnerable and making mistakes需要做一个彻彻底底的人it takes being human, fully human我不是一出生就这样的I was not always like this他的回答中第二个信息是The second message that I got from thisWarren很真诚is that Warren was genuine他很真实 他没有跟我说He was real. He didn't say to me"Tal 别夸我"Oh Tal, stop我也不是很厉害 过奖了"Not really. Come on. Thank you"他没有这样But no他很真诚 他知道自己的价值He was real. He knows his worth他自信He's confident他没有虚伪的谦虚There was no false modesty involved这让我想起and it reminded me当我开始思考自尊时that when I started to think about self-esteem自尊的真正意义and the true meaning of self-esteemBranden的著作中所写的意义as you read in Branden's work对了 他和Nathaniel Branden是好朋友by the way, he and Nathaniel Branden are good friends当我开始读Branden的著作时When I started reading Branden当我明白真正的自尊是什么时and when I realized what real self-esteem was about我明白有高自尊的人都是谦虚的I realized that people with high levels of self-esteem are modest你不需要显摆You don't have the need to show off你们知道 自大You know, arrogance自恋是自尊的对立narcissism is the exact opposite of self-esteem目中无人 自以为是hubris, foolish pride is the exact opposite跟真正意义上的自我感是完全对立的of what a true sense of self is所以当我明白了这点以后So when I understood that我的一个重要目标就是变得one of my important goals was to become谦虚 最重要的目标more importantly to be - modest所以我越来越觉得And it was incredibly important for me要让大家都知道我很谦虚that everyone knows how modest I was英国哲学家Francis Bacon说You know. Francis Bacon, the British philosopher谦虚不过是换了个法子在显摆而已said that modesty is but another form of ostentation这句话用在我身上最合适不过了And for me that certainly was the case但对别人来说不总是这样it's not always the case我认为Warren Bennis是真正的谦虚I think Warren Bennis is modest and truly modest我认为曼德拉I think Nelson Mandela当他谦虚时 他是真正的谦虚when he is being modest, he really is modest但问题是 你怎样才能达到那种层次的谦虚?But the question is: how do you get to that level of modesty?你要达到那种层次的谦虚 方法就是活出自我And you get to this level of modesty by being authentic活得真实by being real走完这个过程by going through the process这个过程就像我们上节课说的那样And the process in many ways as we described last time就像学习走路is like learning how to walk我们刚生出来时Initially when we are born我们连走路是什么都不知道we have no idea what walking even is但慢慢地Then later on我们能站起来we are able to get up但我们需要别人扶着but we need support either of another person或者靠着什么东西or something to lean on例如 我们靠着桌子小心地走出第一步And we take our first precarious steps around a desk, for example慢慢地我们可以自己走了And after a while we can walk without help但我们还是要想着每一步怎么迈But we are still thinking about every step我们跌倒了就再爬起来and we fall down and get up again学会失败 或者一错再错learn to fail or fail to learn然后我们继续走And then we continue walking我们心里时刻想着怎么抬起这条腿and we are very conscious of how we pick up this leg当你观察婴儿学走路时When you watch a baby learn how to walk会觉得很神奇it's fascinating他们需要调动很多东西 才能完成So many things have come together for this simple这么简单的一个动作seemingly simple action过了一段时间后And then after a while婴儿变得更自信了the baby becomes more confident她开始跑了And she begins to run她不再想着怎么走或跑And she no longer has to think about walking or running因为她自然地because then she naturally就会走了she simply walks自我感也是这样 一开始Same with the sense of self: initially我们没有自我感we have no sense of self区分不开"我"和妈妈there's no differentiation between the "me" and the mom或者世界上其他物件or other objects in the world慢慢地我们发展出自我感Gradually, we develop a sense of self但这个自我感是完全依赖外界的but that sense of self is completely dependent不管是身体上还是心理上physically as well as psychologically我们都依赖于父母we are dependent on our parents重要的大人significant adults哥哥或姐姐older sibling然后过了一段时间And then after a while通常是到我们进入青春期后that usually happens when we are teenagers我们开始获得独立we begin to assert our independence这时我们开始渴望That's when we begin to desire听到自己的声音want to hear our own voice想让别人听到自己的声音want to make our own voice heard青春期这段时间很难That's the difficult teenage years对青少年来说难difficult for the teenager对父母来说也难difficult for the parent但这是自然的But it's natural是进化的必经步骤It's part of evolution这时候我们需要我们的界限And we need our boundaries at that time但同时And at the same time我们有时候又需要打破界限we need to sometimes break boundaries我们需要试探现实We need to test reality确定自我Assert ourselves然后随着时间过去And then over time如果我们这么做when we do that随着时间过去 我们同时开始一个新过程over time we begin a new process simultaneously这个过程就是真正的分化And that is the process of real differentiation这时候独立的自我变得太强烈where the independent self becomes so strong我们能够和他们联系that we are able to connect to others as well再一次 引用回讲恋爱课的内容Once again, going back to relationshipNathaniel Branden说过 我们越独立Nathaniel Branden: the more independent we become我们就越互相依存the more interdependent we can be然后我们进步 这需要很长时间And then we evolve and that takes a long time如果我们没有依赖的一面 例如And if we have missed out on the dependent side – for example如果我们年少时没有得到任何赞扬if we didn't get any accolades and any praise或者用Carl Rogers的话来说无条件的and unconditional self-regard in the words of Carl Rogers自我关注when we are younger我们就会有这个需求 回忆一下那个渐成模型then we have that need - remember the model of epigeneti我们不能跳过一层we can't jump over a stage通常我们需要一个治疗师And very often it would take a therapist帮助我们找到无条件的自我关注to provide us with unconditional self-regard这样我们就能到达下一层so that we can go to the next level或者我们需要一段关系Or we need a relationship或几段关系帮助我们培养无条件的自我关注or relationships where we cultivate unconditional self-regard这样我们就能到达下一层so that we can go to the next stage如果…And if we were如果我们在青少年时期when we were teenagers不停地有人叫我们安静constantly told to be quiet守规矩 阻止我们确立自我to behave, prevented from asserting ourselves活出自我being ourselves那么我们就不可能顺利地then we are unlikely to get to the next level到达下一层in a smooth way通常在以后的生活里 我们需要做的事就是And then very often later on in life we need to do首先要确立自己that first to assert ourselves就像青少年那样like teenagers did or do这样就能到达下一层so that we can make it to the next level但不管怎样 这个过程不会顺顺利利But regardless this is not a smooth transition为什么? 因为天下没有完美的父母Why? Because there are no perfect parents因为天下没有完美的成长环境because there is no perfect environment没有完美的老师帮助我们自然而顺利地there are no perfect teachers and for us to evolve naturally通过这些阶段and smoothly through the stages这是不现实的it's just unrealistic在地球上不存在doesn't exis, not here on earth我们在艰苦中随着时间进步And then we evolve over time through the hardships克服困难through the difficulties犯错 跌倒making mistakes, falling再爬起来getting up again慢慢地独立的自我gradually the interdependent self无条件的自尊开始浮现the unconditional self-esteem emerges我们对自己更有自信And we feel much more comfortable in our skinMaslow说他没见过Maslow said that he didn't find people有45岁以下就自我实现的人below the age of 45 who were self-actualized即使是那些自我实现的人And even those self-actualized people仍然有残留的一丝丝独立型自尊still have remnants of independent和依赖型自尊as well as dependent self-esteem这种自尊是不会彻底消失的It never really goes away但它这时变弱了But it's only weaker now它不占主导地位 这时的人不再执着于It's not dominant; it's not what they are about获得更多赞扬the next accolade, the next praise当别人不喜欢他们时就伤心欲绝being devastated when someone doesn't like them当自己不是最好时就伤心欲绝being devastated when they are not the best他们接受了 他们会说They accept it. They say"赢了固然是好 赢不了也无所谓""O, it would be nice to win this."然后他们会继续前进And then they move on他们会问And they ask"我怎样才能让世界变得更美好?"How can I make the world better place?我怎么把积极情绪带给别人?"How can I be a conduit for positive emotions?"Maslow没见过45岁以下自我实现的人Maslow didn't find anyone below the age of Schnarch说要到五六十岁时Schnarch talks about how it's in the 50s and 60s人才分化that the individuals become differentiated才到酝酿出一段关系中最高层次的感情and where the highest potential for passion is within a relationship需要时间It takes time我不是一生下来就这样的I was not always this way正如Bennis指出 不是一生下来就这样的it was not always like this as Bennis pointed out非常重要的一个道理very important lesson很多人都问这个理论是不是放之四海皆准Many people ask about the universal nature of this theory因为你们知道 独立because you know independence is very much或者说个人主义 是西方文化or individualism is very much a Western construct或者说美国文化 西欧文化or American, West European construct如果你去非洲 这会很不同You know you go to Africa - very differen群体的概念the concept of we of a group比个体的概念更重要is much more central to who they are如果大家去亚洲You go to Asia"我们"的概念 集体的概念the concept of the we, collectivism群体的概念比个体的概念更重要the group is much more central to who they are那在其他地方呢?So what about other areas?这是一个专属西方的理论吗?Is this a Western centric theory?答案是"不一定"And the answer is "not necessarily"如果我们的目标是完全自我实现You see, if our goal is to become fully actualized或者用Rogers的话来说or to strive toward that在成为一个人的过程中to be in the process of becoming a person向着这个目标奋进in the words of Rogers那么最后then the final互相依存这个最后阶段对所有文化来说都一样that final stage of interdependence is same in all cultures所有文化都重视这一点All cultures value it他们同样重视这一点They value it just the same不同文化的人 这个过程可能看起来不同the process may look different for a person in Japan日本人 美国人and for a person in United States埃及人 以色列人for a person in Israel or Egypt津巴布韦人 都各不相同compared to a person living in Zimbabwe这个过程看起来不同The process may look different但它有很多相同之处However, it will have many similarities我在第三节课时讲过达赖喇嘛Remember I talked about the Dalai Lama on the third class or so他说他发现西方心理的一个问题是who said that one of the problems he sees in Western psychology我们太着重文化差异了is that we focus too much on cultural differences达赖喇嘛是一个And again, Dalai Lama is very文化触觉非常敏锐的人extremely sensitive culturally他说差异确实存在 我们需要学习它们But he says there are differences; we need to study them但与此同时At the same time我们更需要学习相同之处we need to study even more so the similarities正是这些相同之处把我们联合起来that which brings us together团结起来that unites us而且相同之处多不胜数And there are a lot of similarities希望不久的将来会有越来越多人研究And hopefully soon there'll be more and more research这个话题 并把它应用于不同的文化中on this topic applying it to different cultures and twigging看看它与西方文化以外的世界有什么联系and seeing how it relates outside the Western tradition因为我等一下提到的大部分研究Cause most of the research that I'll mention in a minute都是在美国做的has been done in United States有一些是在英国some of them in UK如果能看看别的地方这个过程是如何的 那会很有趣Will be interesting to see what the process looks like elsewhere但它的核心是But at its core, at its core相似多于差异it is much more similar than different为什么独立很重要?Why is it important to be independent?为什么我们要奋力地达到独立阶段?Why is it that we should strive for this evolution?为什么我们不应该遵从他人Shouldn't we stay of the conformity依赖外界?dependence level?我的理由 以及很多研究结果Now I will argue and the research还有很多历史事件都表明shows as well as historical incidents show that培养独立是我们培养相互依存的it is important to cultivate independence as a way一个重要途径to cultivate interdependence首先First of all因为道德行为because of moral behavior如果大家想想历史上最可怕的暴行if you think about the worst atrocities throughout history历史上最可怕的暴行the worst atrocities throughout history正是那些遵从他人were conducted by people conforming服从权威的人犯下的by obedience to authority那些种族主义或民族主义的信念和行为导致的and by racist or ethnocentric beliefs and behaviors现在来看看我刚才提到的三件事Now look at these three things that I just服从权威 一个人obedience to authority - a person如果有很高的依赖性自尊with high dependence self-esteem就越有可能服从is much more likely to be obedient权威人物to an authority figure为什么? 因为这样的人寻求赞扬Why? Because he or she seeks accolades他们寻求认同they seek approval他们没有强烈的自我感They don't feel strong enough themselves他们需要一个有魅力的领袖告诉他们They need that very charismatic leader to tell them"你真棒 你真厉害 你太了不起了""Oh,you are fine, You are OK, You are superior"因为他们的自我感依赖于这些赞扬Because that's where their sense of self is dependent on如果我们需要不停地获得群体的赞扬because we are much more likely to conform to what a group is doing我们就更可能遵循群体的做法if we need constantly the accolades of that group大家想想Milgram的实验You think about the Milgram experimentAsch的实验you think about Asch experiments上过第15节和第1节的同学those of you who've taken Psych 15,or Psych 大家想想种族主义 什么是种族主义?You think about racism. What is racism?种族主义就是通过比较一些外在因素Racism is about comparison and wanting to assert superiority来证明自己高人一等on the base of some external factor换言之In other words我本身不够好I'm not good enough as I am证明不了我有多好You know, to prove how good I am我必须拿自己跟别人比较I have to compare myself to another我可以比较居住的地方whether I choose you know, place of residence比较成长教育whether I choose upbringing比较肤色whether I choose the color of the skin它的中心是相对能力感It's about relative competence但是独立的人Whereas people who are independent没有这种比较的需求 或者说这种需求没那么强烈don't have the need or have less of that need for comparison遵循他人的需求也没那么强烈as well as less of that need to conform他们坚持原则They are true to principles他们自己的原则their own principles但原则并不是万灵药Now this is not a panacea原则并不总是好的This is not always good因为纳粹分子because I'm sure there are also Nazis也很坚持自己的原则who are true to their principles但我等一下讲的研究But as I'll show later in research表明坚持原则的人更可能those who are true to their principles are more likely听从自己的心to follow their heart只要他们的心没有受伤And unless their heart is damaged我说的受伤不是一个比喻I mean that in a true sense of the word, damaged他们会追求做好事they will seek to do good他们会追求帮助他人They will seek to help他们的移情会增加Their levels of empathy will increase566这是移情的矛盾And this is the paradox of empathy当我培养移情时It's actually when we cultivate empathy或者说当我们培养…or rather when we cultivate实在找不到更好的词for lack of a better term我也不想用一个新词and I actually don't want to use a new term当我们培养自爱时When we cultivate self-love当我们培养自尊时when we cultivate self-esteem我们就会更有可能变得that's when we are most likely富有同情心 爱别人to be empathic and to love others大家想想黄金原则Look at the golden rule要像爱自己一样爱你的邻居love your neighbors as you love yourself在这个原则里What does that爱你的邻居的先决条件是什么?what is the prerequisite of loving your neighbor?爱自己The self你就是标准You are the standard我们自己是我们评价他人的标准we are the standard of how we evaluate others因为我们怎么对待他们经常…because our behavior toward others very often不是通常not always但经常都反映了我们怎么对待自己very often - mirrors our behavior toward ourselves所以那些培养独立自我感的人So people cultivating independent sense of self那些有强烈自我认同的人 更能认同别人who have a strong self identity are better able to identify with others587除了道德行为以外In addition to moral behavior还会有更好的认知表现better cognitive performance - you see有强烈依赖型自尊的人people who have a strong dependent self-esteem或者说行动主要由他人言论决定的人or are primarily driven by what other people say会遵循别人在遵循的规矩will follow the rule that has already been taken他们很可能变得就像一台机器一样They will, can potentially be great mechanics因为他们会为了得到赞扬而努力because they'll work hard for these accolade努力是好事and that's a good thing, to work hard但他们不会打破陈规But they'll basically remain within the box而有强烈独立型自尊的人whereas the people who have a stronger sense of independent self-esteem就会打破陈规think outside the box选择别人没有走过的道路choose the path that hasn't already been taken但这并不代表他们不会选择That doesn't mean that they can't walk in the pat00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,900别人已经走过的路that has been taken只是这是他们真正if that is what they really真正想要的生活就行了really want to do with their lives所以如果我们说"别人说走东 我偏偏走西"So you know it's just as much sign of dependence when we say这同样也是依赖型的"Wel,I am gonna do the opposite of what everyone else does."因为我的行为还是取决于他人because I'm still dependent on what everyone else does所以这不是独立型自尊So that's not independent self-esteem而是依赖型自尊That's just more dependence如果我坐下说But if I sit down and I say"好的 我该怎么过我的人生?""Ok, what do I really, really want to do with my life?"我很认真地想And I think about it truly把自己置身于一个没人知道我在做什么的世界Put myself in a world that no one would know what I was doing我会更可能找到我的爱好I'm much more likely to identify that thing which is my passion我的核心 我的使命 也许是在投资银行工作my core, my calling - be it in investment banking也许是在UniLu工作or work in the UniLu这并不重要It doesn't matter问题是"我的动力是什么?"The question is "What is the source of that"有独立型自尊的人活到老学到老Person with independent self-esteem is committed to continuous learning回忆一下John Carlton的研究 在哈佛商学院的毕业生中Remember the John Carlton's study – what differentiated the HBS grads优等生与别的学生之间的区别就是the extraordinary ones from the rest他们总是问问题was that, they were always asking questions他们总是想学更多They always wanted to learn more他们不会They didn't get out of – you know从大学或商学院毕业后graduate from college or graduate from business school或者读完博士or from a PHD program诸如此类的学位后 说or wherever it is, and say"我懂得够多了""OK,I know enough""现在我是经理了 现在我是领导了Or "Now I'm a manager; now I'm the leader我会告诉人们应该做什么"I'll tell people how they should…这是Warren Bennis的一个优点This is the amazing thing about Warren Bennis他总是问问题He's always asking questions他对别人做的事感兴趣He's always interested in what people are doing他总是在学习He's always learning我等一下会给大家看一个研究Happiness, levels of happiness are higher当我们有独立型自尊时and I'll show you the research in a minute我们的幸福感会更高when we experience a sense of independent self-esteem我们会更平静 我们不会不停地We are much calmer when we don't constantly向别人证明自己have to prove ourselves to others总是处于警惕状态是一件很劳心劳力的事It is enervating to constantly be on the guard这个人会喜欢我吗? 我怎么得到他们的认同?Is this person gonna like me? How do I gain their validation?当我们这样想时 我们会更平静:We are much calmer when we say"让我表达自己"Let me express myself没错 我也许会受伤害And yes it may hurt me如果他们不喜欢我 我会伤心It will hurt me, if they don't like me没问题 我承受得住That's OK. I'm resilient我很坚强 我可以接受"I'm strong, I can deal."存在感更平静了Much calmer - sense of being当我们表达自己 而不是时刻想着表现自己when we express rather than constantly try to impress想象一下我们的生活会变得多轻松Imagine how much lighter our lives can be如果 当我们在教室时if, when we are here或者当我们走出教室时or when we walk out of here我们感受到这种存在感we experience the sense of being越来越多地…more and more of the time重申一次 不是完全地again, not perfectly因为这有违人的天性because that's not human但我们可以越来越多地单纯地存在but more and more of the time to just be, to exist感激我们的存在 作为一个整体存在to celebrate our existence and the existence as a whole我给大家讲几个研究Let me share with you just some of the research这样的研究不是很多There hasn't been a lot00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:50,200我想给大家讲我做的一些研究And I wanna share with you just some of the work that I did for是我读博士学位时做的 后来还继续做了一点as part of my PHD and a little bit beyond第一个研究是关于The first research that was really able to deal with自尊的矛盾the paradox of self-esteem也就是说 有些人得到很多赞扬of how some people get so much accolade但他们的自尊下降了and yet their self-esteem decreases而那些有很高自尊的人 有些有敌对情绪or how some people have high self-esteem or hostile但有些却对别人宽厚仁慈versus others that are generous and benevolent第一个研究是Kernis做的The first research that was done was by Kernis他在1995年提出自尊稳定性这个概念who back in 1995 came up with the concept of self-esteem stability他说 真正能够预测And he said what actually can predict一个人究竟是敌对还是宽厚whether a person will be hostile or generous他们的自尊会随着时间增高whether their self-esteem over time will be high还是降低的 不是自尊本身or whether it will lower over time is not a self-esteem per se而是自尊的稳定性but rather is the stability of their self-esteem他发现…他追踪实验对象And what he showed - he followed people例如 一两周you know, for example, for a week or two weeks他会测评他们的状态自尊而不是特质自尊and he would measure their state rather than trait他们当时的状态自尊their state self-esteem at the time有些人…So there were certain people who假设这里是自尊水平if this is the self-esteem level这里是时间and this is time在某个时候 有些人的自尊在这里There were people whose self-esteem at this point然后第二天was here and then the next day在这里 然后这里here, and then here然后又回到这里 这里and then here again, and then here这里…and here and here假设他测了十次and he measured, let's sa, ten times他想测出And what he wanted to see这些数据分布的标准偏差to measure - the standard deviation of the spread它有多接近? 有多稳定?How close was it? How stable was it?假设这个人So this would be someone with平均来说maybe on average有很高的自尊high self-esteem但有很多起伏but with a lot of fluctuations有些人则像这样Other people were more like this也有起起伏伏Again, ups and downs有时是很大的起伏but sometimes large fluctuations但总体来说but overall很稳定pretty stable同样水平的自尊Same level of self-esteem特质自尊trait self-esteem但状态自尊的起伏少了很多but state self-esteem fluctuated far less他发现 是自尊的稳定性And what he showed was that it was the stability而不是自尊本身 决定了rather than self-esteem per se that determined一个人是敌对还是仁慈whether or not a person would be hostile or benevolent自尊不稳定的人People with unstable self-esteem更可能充满敌对情绪were more likely to be hostile而自尊更稳定的人People with more stable self-esteem更可能宽厚仁慈were more likely to be generous and benevolent这就解释了自尊理论的resolving a lot of the contradictions很多矛盾和误解misunderstanding in the literature当我看到这个理论时 我顿悟了When I saw this, I had a eureka亲身体验到的一次顿悟personal eureka experience我说And I said"就是它了 他找到答案了""This is it! He's onto something."我在2000年写我的硕士论文时And what I did in my master's thesis back in 我设计了一个问卷was created a questionnaire一个很简单的问卷 测量依赖型自尊a very simple questionnaire that measured dependent versus和独立型自尊的对比independent self-esteem我测评学生And I measured students大部分是哈佛学生 我还在新加坡做了代表性抽样调查mostly Harvard students - I did also cross sectional in Singapore我那时经常在新加坡 得出同样的结果I was spending a lot of time there at the time - similar results亚洲和美国的一样Asia and here至少新加坡和美国的一样at least in Singapore and in United States我发现 依赖型自尊And what I found was that dependent self-esteem与不稳定性有关was associated with instability而独立型自尊与稳定性有关independent self-esteem was associated with stability换言之In other words我只测量了一次 而不是十次I came up with one measure that instead measuring ten times到底这种自尊会导致敌对情绪whether that kind of self-esteem would lead to hostility焦虑 还是平静或宽厚anxiety, versus calmness or generosity我只用了一个测量数据I used just one measure我发现And that's what I found依赖性自尊与自尊不稳定性very high correlation between dependent self-esteem高度相关and self-esteem instability两者成正比positive correlation而独立型自尊和自尊稳定性and a positive correlation between independent self-esteem也成正比and self-esteem stability738当时我的一些学生也就此做了一些研究Then some of my students at the time did research on it例如 Mellisa ChristinoFor example, Mellisa Christino你们会在这门课上who you'll meet看到她写的一些东西at least some of her writing later on in this class她本科时写的毕业论文did her senior thesis as an undergrad here就是表明独立型自尊和快乐on showing the connection between independent self-esteem and happiness独立型自尊与心流的关系and independent self-esteem and flow那些有高度独立型自尊的人Those who had high independent self-esteem最有可能在运动场上体验到心流were most likely to experience flow on athletic field因为这就是她的研究对象 哈佛运动员which is where her research was - Harvard athletics高度独立自尊的人也有更高的幸福感also connected to higher levels of happiness我的论文是想准确地找出Then my dissertation was trying to pin down these exact characteristics自尊理论存在的问题that were problematic in self-esteem literature我说过 高度自尊意味着自恋Remember, high self-esteem means narcissism怎么区分这两者?How do you differentiate?我在论文里发现Well, what I found in the dissertation was that自恋其实是与高度依赖型自尊有关narcissism is connected actually to high dependent self-esteem而自恋与独立型自尊没有什么关系There was no correlation between independent self-esteem and narcissism至于宽厚When it comes to generosity这也许是研究中最令人意外的结果this was probably the most surprising result of the study有独立型自尊的人people with independent self-esteem其实更宽厚仁兹were actually more generous and benevolent不仅自我报告如此 对他人的行为也是如此both in terms of self report and in terms of their actual behavior非常强烈的自我感toward other people - a strong sense of self我说过 像爱自己一样爱你的邻居Remember, love your neighbor as you love yourself己所不欲 勿施于人Do not do unto others which you would not have done to yourself当你对自我有一个高标准时And when you have a high standard for the self对他人也会有一个高标准there is a high standard for the other通常这是无意识地发生的And that usually happens automatically因为我们怎么对待他人就会怎么对待自己because we mirror our behavior toward the "I"还有敌对情绪And then hostility敌对情绪与自尊本身没有关系no correlation between hostility and self-esteem per se因为有些because some people have有高度自尊的人 有很高的敌对情绪with high self-esteem, have high levels of hostility但有些有高度自尊的人 敌对情绪很低some people with high self-esteem have low levels of hostility而且更宽厚仁慈and more generosity但依赖型和独立型自尊能预测敌对情绪But dependent and independent self-esteem predicted hostility那些有高度自尊的人 而且自尊主要是依赖型的Those with high self-esteem that was mostly dependent这样的人更可能…但也有例外 不是所有人都会这样were more likely, not always, not every person但平均来说 这样的人更可能表现出敌对but on average, were more likely to display hostility而那些有高度自尊 而且主要是独立型自尊的人those people with high self-esteem that is mostly independent会更坦率 合作 宽厚were much more open, cooperative and generous完美主义 那时我有两个学生Perfectionism - two of my students at that timeTiffany Ignaczyk和Kate RicheyTiffany Ignaczyk and Kate Richey她是这个班的助教who is a TF in this class做了一个很优秀的研究 表明完美主义did fantastic work showing the connection between perfectionism和自尊的关系 有高度独立型自尊的人and self-esteem - how people with high independent self-esteem他们是完美主义者的可能性更低were less likely to be perfectionistic为什么? 独立型自尊的人更注重表达自己Why? Because it is about self expression注重学习和成长it's about constantly learning and growing而学习和成长And part of learning and growing就必定要跌倒再爬起is falling down and getting up again学习只有这个途径no other way to learn而依赖型自尊更注重…Whereas dependent self-esteem were more concerned我上节课引用Mihnea Moldoveanu说的话the words of Mihnea Moldoveanu that I quoted last time我们声称自己想要真相we say we want the truth但其实我们只是想自己是正确的what we mean is that we want to be correct更依赖于他人的看法more dependent on how they perceived更完美主义 更害怕失败more perfectionistic, more afraid of failure这同样适用于…我们之前讲过So this applies also - and we talked about before但我想再说一次 适用于恋爱but I just want to point it out again - to relationships这也是David SchnarchThat's work on the topic就这个课题所做的研究 我们说过David Schnarch again where we talked about我们怎么达到被了解的阶段how do we get to the stage of being known而不是被认可的阶段rather than being validated这并不代表在七八十岁时And that doesn't mean that at the age of 70 or 当我们完全进化了when we are fully evolved我们并不喜欢 或者不需要我们伴侣的认可we don't enjoy or need at times the validation of our partner我们需要We do但同时But at the same time我们更关心的是表达自我we are much more about self expressionDavid Schnarch是这样说的Here is what David Schnarch has to say"分化是你维持自我感的能力"Differentiation is your ability to maintain your sense of self当你情绪上和/或身体上when you are emotionally and/or physically与别人亲近close to others尤其是这些人变得对你越来越重要时especially as they become increasingly important to you分化使你维持自己的道路Differentiation permits you to maintain your own course当爱人 朋友when lovers, friends家庭向你施压 让你同意和遵从时and family pressure you to agree and conform分化良好的人能够同意 但又不会觉得Well-differentiated people can agree without feeling他们"失去自我"like they're 'losing themselvs'能够不同意 但又不会觉得被排挤和难受"and can disagree without feeling alienated and embittered."这正是被了解的含义This is what being known is all about做你自己 分化出来being yourself, being differentiated这就是独立型自尊的核心This is what independent self-esteem is这是最高境界的相互依存的this is what ultimately interdependence真谛is all about825说来容易做来难easier said than done但用它来启发我们是非常有用的But again it's very helpful to have that as a heuristic在我们潜意识里the back of your mind当它发生时 能够注意到to notice that it's happening因为在20岁这个年龄Because at the age of 你们也会经历相互依存的时刻you are also experiencing moments of interdependence与朋友家人产生真正的联系real connection with a friend, family走在后院里 欣赏美景just walking in the yard and admiring the beauty of it all这些珍贵的时刻 随着时间过去and  these are precious moments that over time我们会有越来越多we can have more and more of只要我们跟从这条自然的道路if we follow the natural path自然的发展the natural evolution继续用回走路那个比喻Going back to the analogy of walking我经常…我们知道I'm very often when - we know these you know历史上有很多故事stories through history有些人被迫穿上people were put in you know shoes太小的鞋子 或者被剥夺走路的自由that were too small for them or were not allowed to try and walkCeausescu统治下的罗马尼亚就是这样such as very often the case was in Romanian under Ceausescu人们无法自然发展where people were not allowed to develop naturally当我们的自然发展被阻碍了when our natural development is hindered这是有可能的and it can be hindered我们就不能如我们所能的那样发展we don't evolve as we can所以在心理层面上也有这个问题So the question is also on the psychological level我们怎样才能如我们所能地发展? 你们在这个学期how can we evolve as we can? And some of the tools所学到的一些方法that you learned throughout the semester不管是认知的学习方法whether it is the cognitive tool of learning允许自己有人的天性the permission to be human还是你们具体地运用的方法or the tools that you can actually apply例如写日记such as keeping a journal做运动such as exercising学会感恩such as doing the gratitude exercise冥想 练瑜伽such as meditating, or doing yoga这些方法都是All these things as you'll see are ways有助实现自我的方法of becoming more self-actualized它们能加速这个过程of expediting the process当我们加速这个过程And when we expedite the process就意味着此时此刻我们就能越来越多地it means that right now right here we are able to experience体验到那种存在感that sense of being much more often我们不用等到50 60或70岁we don't need to wait until we are 50 or 60 or 我们可以早早地就踏上那条健康的道路We can on that healthy journey way before that那么我们该怎么做?So how do we do it? How do we do it?我们说回Let me go back to the model我们讲改变时讲过的那个模型we talked about when we discussed change我们讲过改变的ABCAnd we talked about the ABC of changeA是情感 B是行为 C是认知Affect. Behavior, and Cognition我说过改变的最重要方法And I mentioned that the most important approach to change改变的最有效方法是B 行为the most effective approach to change is the B, the Behavior我用一个模型讲过态度如何改变行为And I introduced this model of how attitudes change behavior反过来行为如何改变态度and in turn how behavior changes attitudes大家回忆一下自我知觉理论Remember self-perception theory如果你想在某个生活领域得到改善if you want to improve in one area in our lives最好的方法就是让自己的行为变得像改善了一样the best thing to do is to behave as we would如果我想要高度自尊If I want high self-esteem我的行为就要像一个有高度自尊的人I need to behave like a person with high self-esteem behaves为什么? 因为自尊就是一种态度Why? Because self-esteem is simply an attitude是我对自我的态度it's the attitude I have toward the self是我对自己的评价it's the I evaluating the me要提高这种态度And to enhance that attitude我就要…或者说最有效的办法I need to engage - or the most effective way不是唯一的办法not the only way最有效的办法 就是表现出一个but the most effective way is to engage in behavior of a person有高度自尊的人的行为with high self-esteem所以榜样的作用很重要which is why it's so important to have role models我说的榜样不止一个And I'm saying that in plural有榜样很重要It's important to have role models我们可以学习这些人people we can look up to说and say"我想有这样的性格…"I want to have that chara...不 我想有Warren Bennis那样的No. I want to have the calm and the acceptance平静 包容和慷慨精神and the generosity of spirit that Warren Bennis has我想有Marva Collins身上的I want to have the passion那种对教学的热爱for teaching that Marva Collins displays把榜样的所有优点综合起来integrate that aggregates of role models这样我们就能有他们那样的行为 并且慢慢地培养so that we can behave and over time achieve that attitude我们追求的那种态度that we are looking for我来讲一下提高自尊的几个方法So let me go over a few of them of how to enhance self-esteem大部分都已经讲过了We've discussed most所以这也算是很好地总结一下我们讲过的内容so this is a good summary of some of the things that we went through首先有高度独立型自尊的人通常…First, people with high independent self-esteem generally正如我们之前从研究中看到的那样as we saw before from the research包括Melissa Christino和其他人的研究Melissa Christino's research and others'他们通常更平静are generally calmer所以独立型自尊是一种态度So independent self-esteem is the attitude平静是一种行为calm is the behavior也就是说 行为平静的人which also means that people who behave calmly他们的独立型自尊会随着时间增加will increase over time their independent self-esteem我们在和冥想相关的研究中看过 例如And we see that in related research on meditation for example正念冥想on mindfulness当我们越来越多地练习这种方法as we induce more of it我们的自尊our self-esteem我们独立型的自尊and it is the independent part of self-esteem因为它不需要赞扬because they are not about accolades"我今天冥想得真好"Oh I meditated so well today大家给我鼓掌"Everyone, clap."这不是这种自尊的重点It's not about that它的重点是带来平静It's about inducing calm关注自己 活出自己being centered, being myself又例如运动Or physical exercise运动能带来平静physical exercise induces calm因为它在体内释放某种酶because it releases certain enzyme某些化学物质 这样随着时间过去certain chemicals in the body so that over time它能直接增强我们的独立型自尊it actually strengthens our independent self-esteem indirectly因为行为because behavior体验了平静 导致态度的转变experiencing the calm leads to a changing attitude假设你中了一个无名咒语Imagine that a spell of anonymity has been cast on you从现在起在你的余生里From now on and for the rest of your life没有人会知道你做什么no one will know what you are doing除了你自己 没有人知道你有多好no one but you will know how good you are你有多宽厚how generous you are你有多仁慈how benevolent you are除了你自己 没有人知道你有多富有多强大No one but you will know how wealthy and powerful你有多重要and important you are只有你自己知道你的成就You and you alone will know about all your accomplishments只有你知道你有多好的操守you and you alone will know about how ethical道德和性格moral and wonderful you are在这样的一个世界里 你中了无名咒语In such a world where a spell of anonymity has been cast on you你会怎么做？what would you do?有谁觉得很熟悉吗? 你们会怎么做?Familiar, anyone? What would you do?正如我在课后作业里提过那样Now as I mentioned in the response paper这并不代表我们在匿名世界里怎么生活this does not mean that this is what I need to do在现实世界里就应该怎么生活with my life - what I would do in this anonymous world这个方法的意义是 在这样一个世界里What it is saying though is in such world或者说做这样的练习or doing this exercise它能磨练我们it can help us hone in在抛开赞扬和声望的情况下on what we would do regardless of the accolades我们会怎么做and praise and prestige我经常练习这个方法 大家知道I do this exercise regularly - as you know在这个班上 我介绍给大家的方法 我都一一练过no exercise in this class that I assign to you is foreign to me我都练过I do them all我也像大家一样边上课边学习I'm going through this class just as you are我会经常用这个方法And I do this class, this regularly例如 我在这里读研究生的时候And for example, when I did it as a graduate student here我当时的答案是在那样的一个世界里my response was that in such a world我可能连博士学位都拿不到I actually would not get a PHD我不会拿到博士学位I would not get a PHD因为读博对我来说不是一件很愉快的事 虽然很有意义because it wasn't that pleasurable to me - very meaningful但没那么愉快but less pleasurable to me我读得不是很好I wasn't that good at it不觉得我自己有什么惊人能力didn't feel like I was thriving但我也跟自己说 在现实世界里But I also said to myself that in our world不是那个没人知道我在做什么的世界not in that world where no one would know what I was doing而是在一个别人知道我在做什么的世界but in a world where people know what I'm doing我需要一个博士学位才能在大学任教I would need a PHD in order to teach at a university所以我继续学习 最终拿到了我的博士学位which is why I continued and eventually got my PHD我是在毕业前不久做这个练习的I did this exercise just before I graduated我当时在考虑不同的出路And I was thinking about different areas to pursue我想 在一个没有人知道我在做什么的世界里And I said, what would I do in such a world我会做什么?where no one would know what I was doing?我的答案是教书And the answer to that was I would teach我的答案是我不会做研究The answer to that was I would not do research这是很肯定的That was very clear所以那时候我决定放弃争取终身任期And that's when I decided to get out of the tenure track option即使当时外界 那些关心我的人even though there was a lot of pressure on me from the outside给了我很大的压力from people who cared about me他们说"再写两三篇文章And they said "Look, two or three articles你就能拿到一个很好的职位 争取终身任期and you'll get into a great place, and the tenure track你能做到的 你的博士论文可以发表的"You can do it. You know your PHD, can be published."但我知道我不想过那样的生活But I knew that wasn't the life that I wanted to lead我要为此付出代价吗? 要Is there a price for it? Yes其中一个代价就是I mean one of the price is that, you know这是我在哈佛的倒数第二节课了this is my second last class at Harvard但我想要什么样的世界But what kind of world我想过什么样的生活what kind of life did I want for myself这个方法帮助我找到了And that exercise helped me hone on that你热爱什么? 你真正What are your passions? What you really想过的是怎么样的人生?really want to do with your life?你希望10年 20年后Where do you see yourself 10 years from now你会变成什么样?or 20 years from now?什么对你来说是非常重要的?What's really important for you?什么对你来说是重要的What's important for you就算没有别人的认同 点头 赞扬和欢呼that you would do regardless of other people's approval反对或批评nods, accolades or cheering你也会做的?or disapproval, or criticism?你在这样一个世界里会做什么?What would you do in such a world?这是一个很重要的问题It's an important question to ask那些…People who experience有高度独立型自尊的人会追求他们的兴趣who have high independent self-esteem pursue their passions那些追求他们兴趣的人会有更高的自尊people who pursue their passions enjoy higher levels of self-esteem那些有很多心流的人People who enjoy a lot of flow他们的独立型自尊也会增加their independent self-esteem will increase as well问问你自己 "你什么情况下体验过心流?Ask yourself: where do you experience flow?你什么时候忘我过? 是你读书的时候吗?Where do you lose yourself? Is it when you read?是坐在Is it over dinner你队友旁边吃晚餐时吗?when you are sitting next to your block mates?是你写作时吗?Is it when you write?是你站在全班同学前面Is it when you are standing in front of a class介绍一个课后活动时吗?speak in an after school program?你什么时候体验过?When do you experience it?你以前什么时候感受过心流? 问问你自己When did you experience it in the past? Ask yourself因为它最能预测到你未来什么情况下会有心流Because that very often is the best predictor of future flow你想过什么样的人生?What kind of life do you want to lead?你真正想做的是什么?What do you really, really want to do?有高度独立型自尊的人会付诸行动People with high independent self-esteem put themselves on the line他们会应对 不停地加强自己They cope, they stretch themselves constantly因为他们总是想学习成长Because they are always about learning and growing进步 发挥更大的作用improving making more of difference触及更多的人touching more people那些应对的人…And people who cope大家回忆一下 自我知觉理论remember, self perception theory那些应对的人 随着时间过去people who cope over time会获得更高的独立型自尊will enjoy higher levels of independent self-esteem即使他们这样做的时候跌倒过Even if they fall while doing it即使失败了四次even if she says no four times他们会重新站起来 变得更强大they get up again and they get stronger他们的独立型自尊会随着时间增强And their independent self-esteem strengthens over time那个图并不是这样子的The graph doesn't look just like this起起伏伏 有高有低the ups and downs with spikes真正的图是有起有伏It looks with same ups and downs但健康 快乐和自尊的走势but with an upward trajectory of well being是呈上升趋势的happiness and self-esteem谦虚 真诚的谦虚Humble behavior - genuine humble behavior我最喜欢的一本书One of my favorite texts也是我的文化里最重要的一本书之一and I think one of the most important texts in my traditionPirkei Avos 《先贤箴言》Pirkei Avos, the Chapter of the Fathers里面有一句话There's a sentence there一句谚语 我读了一遍又一遍a proverb  that I've been reading over and over and over again但一直都参透不了and never could understand直到我听到一个著名的拉比until I heard an interpretation of a well-known Rabbi拉比Mitchell Wohlberg 他对句话的解释Rabbi Mitchell Wohlberg about this interpretation这句话是这样说的And here is the sentence我翻译过来:那些追逐荣誉的人I'm translating: those who chase after honor荣誉会躲避他们honor will run away from them那些躲避荣誉的人those who run away from honor荣誉会追逐他们honor will chase them再说一次:那些追…Let me repeat: those who run after追逐荣誉的人who chase honor荣誉会躲避他们honor will run away from them那些躲避荣誉的人those who run away from honor荣誉会追逐他们honor will chase them我一直都参透不了 直到我听到拉比WohlbergAnd it didn't make sense to me until I put it in the context关于自尊的一场演讲 并把它跟这句话结合起来理解the result of the lecture by Rabbi Wohlberg of self eteem荣誉的本质是尊敬自己Honor is essentially honoring the self相信自己believing in one self如果我不停地追逐荣誉And if I'm constantly about chasing honor追逐下一个赞扬 下一个奖the next accolade, the next prize下一个认同 下一个认可the next approval, the next validation荣誉就会躲避我then honor will run away from me下一次我就要在更陡的山坡上And then I'll have to push that stone up steeper把石头推上去incline the next time我继续追逐荣誉 等我到达了山顶And I continue to chase that honor and I get there石头又会滚下来and then the rock rolls back down again科林斯王就要继续推石头 而山坡变得And Sisyphus continues on and on with the steep becoming...越来越陡峭with the incline becoming steeper相反 如果我躲避荣誉 言行谦虚Whereas if I run away from honor - behave humbly随着时间过去 真正的荣誉over time honor, true honor打心底发出的荣誉感就会追逐我internally generated honor will chase me行为可以改变态度Behavior can change attitude这需要时间It takes time重申 一开始And again at the beginning正如我之前说过as I mentioned to you before我想变得谦虚 我想大家都知道I wanted to be modest and I wanted everyone to know我有多谦虚how modest I was and how humble I was我明白And I understood that well那不是真诚的谦虚that's not genuine但我仍然可以保持谦虚的言行but I can still behave and act in a humble way随着时间过去And over time它就会慢慢地融入我们it becomes more and more part of who we are行为不会一夜之间就改变态度Behavior changing attitude doesn't happen overnight但这并不意味着一个80岁And again it doesn't mean that a person at 完成进化 实现自我的人 不会追寻荣誉who is evolved and actualized does not look for honor at all当他们被赞扬时 不会觉得高兴does not feel good when he or she is praised那是很自然的 是人的天性That's natural - part of who we are以下这个知识点很重要This is an important one我们在班上经常讲简化生活We've talked about it a lot in the class about simplifying那…The...我经常想 为什么在一个I've often wondered the why is it that in a county像美国这样的国家里like the United States一个追崇个人主义 自为更生的国家such an individualistic country - self-reliance大家在高中时读了爱默生most of you read it in high school by Emerson那么多关于个人主义和自我的书so much about individualism and the self为什么你们还是那么随波逐流?why is it that there's such high levels of conformity?为什么有那么多人还是走Why is it that so many people go on the path以前很多人已经走过的路?that has been already taken and prescribed by others?这并不意味着走这条路的人都是随波逐流的That doesn't mean that everyone who goes on the path conforms再一次 你可能很循规蹈矩Again, you can be highly conforming选择做一个顾问或者在流浪者之家choosing to work as a consultant or choosing to be a volunteer做自愿者at a homeless shelter你可能是取决于他人的 也可能是取决于自我的You can be equally other determined or equally self determined重点不在于选哪条路It's not about choosing a particular path重点是为什么But why did I我们会看到这么多随波逐流的人?why do we see so many people who conform?我想这是因为他们的成长教育And I think it's because of their right raise我想是因为美国人I think it's because people in the United States或者普遍来说 西方世界Western world in general没有花足够的时间来反省do not take enough time to reflect思考这样的问题:and to think about those questions such as"我真正想过的人生是怎样的?""what do I reall, really want to do with my life?问这样的问题:to ask questions such as"在一个没有人知道我在做什么的世界里"what would I do in a world where no one would know我会做什么?"what I was doing?"用三问法来问自己 意义to go through the three question process - the meaning"什么有意义?" "什么让我快乐?""what is meaningful?"; "what is pleasurable?""我喜欢什么?" "我擅长什么?""what do I enjoy?"; and "what am I good at?""我的强项是什么?""What are my strengths?"问自己这些问题To go through these questions and to ask问这些重要的问题those important questions因为当我们退后一步 慢慢思考because when we take a step back and take the time这时我们才能变成自我that's when we become ourselve我们才能找到适合我们的道路that's when we identify the path that is right for me我想用一个阶段模型来给大家讲解Let me illustrate this by showing you a stage model这是以Daniel Gilbert的研究为基础的And this is based on the work of Daniel Gilbert与他的认知晕眩研究有间接关系indirectly refers to it his work on cognitive dizziness他和其他人的研究发现And what he and others have shown is that当人的认知忙乱时 当他们匆匆忙忙时people behave very differently when they are cognitively busy他们的行为会非常不同于when they are in a hurry当他们慢慢花时间versus when they have time专心思考一下他们所做的事时they can focus on whatever it is that they are doing也跟Tim Kasser的时间充裕研究有关So also connected to Tim Kasser's work on time affluence第一个段阶是我们没有时间的阶段So the first stage is the stage where we don't have time我们很赶时间 匆匆忙忙we are in a hurry; we are rushed我们的反应是无意识的our reaction is automatic在这个阶段 我们会随波逐流This is the part where we conform我们会遵从群体This is time when we conform to the group就像Asch做的实验那样as in the Asch experiments在这个阶段 当那个穿白袍的人this is when we conform to the man with a white coat00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,告诉我们实验必须继续时 我们会遵从telling us the experiment must go on我们会按下按钮 电击一个无辜的人And we push the button and shock an innocent victim在这个阶段我们会随波逐流地服从This is where conformity to obedience服从群体conformity to a group is当我们没有时间时when we don't have time当我们匆忙时when we are busy当我们不认真思考when we don't really think about我们想做什么 可以做什么时what it is that we want to do and can do这是依赖的自我 第一阶段This is our dependent self - stage one通常这时我们会到达第二阶段We very often at this moment can reach stage two不用等很久don't need to wait a long time这时 如果我们慢慢来At this moment, if we take the time因为如果我们慢慢来because when we take the time这时我们就开始有意识思考that's when we engage in deliberate reflection把思考与行为结合起来combining reflection and action这时候我们会想我们做的事where we think about what we do想我们想的事we think about what we think我们慢慢来We take our time这个阶段的自我是自主的This is where the self is autonomous这时候独立型自尊出现了this is where the independent self-esteem emerges当我们慢慢来时when we have the time我们随波逐流的可能性就会减低That's where we are much less likely to conform这时我们会培养that's when we are cultivating表达我们独立的核心自我and expressing our independent core self想想接下来的一个实验Think of the, of the following experiment01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,900今天做不了 很可惜It cannot be done today unfortune... Well其实也不可惜I mean it's not unfortunate今天做不了but it cannot be done today这个实验其实是重复Milgram的实验 但有一个改动And that is to retry the Milgram experiment with one difference大家想象一下 有些同学熟悉Milgram实验Imagine this - some of you know the Milgram experiment我们在班上已经讲过了We've spoken about it here你坐在椅子里 手放在按钮上You are sitting on the chair with your hand on the buttons或者在你面前有一个控制台Or in front of you, you have the panel你选择60伏电压And you go up to sixty volts那个学习者没有什么反应And there's no real reaction from the other person, the learner你上升到75伏And you go up to 75 volts增加了15伏a 15 volt increment你升高到120伏 那个被电击的人And you get to 120 volts and the confederate你觉得他真的被电击了whom you think is really being shocked他说"哎哟 很痛"says "Ouch! That hurts"你抬起头看那个穿白袍的人And you go and you look up at the person with the white coat他说"实验必须继续"and he says to you "the experiment must go on"你继续提高电压 那个人被电得尖叫And you go up and up; and the person is screaming告诉你他要心脏病发了and telling you he has a heart condition你抬头看实验人员And you look up at the experimenter他看起来就像那样who looks like this他告诉你…我之前一直没注意过他And he tells you - I never noticed him until now很高兴我从没注意过他I'm glad I've never noticed him他跟你说"实验必须继续"He says to you "the experiment must go on"你继续And you go on那些人开始大哭起来And they start to whimper and say"我有心脏病 快放我出去""I have a heart condition, Get me out of here!"你抬头看And you look up实验人员说And the experimenter says"没有答案是错误的答案"no answer is wrong answer提高电压 实验必须继续Raise the voltage. The experiment must go on."这时63%的参与者会把电压提高到350伏Now 63 percent of participants went above 350 volt超过那个人所能承受的水平which is beyond the level where the person was not even heard anymore他们继续电击到 直到XXX点They continue to shock them until the point of xxx超过了危险水平beyond the very dangerous因为他告诉他们 实验必须继续because he told them that the experiment must go on现在想象一下 同样的实验 但有一个小小的改动Now imagine the same experiment with a slight difference你用75伏电压电他们 他们说You give them 75 volts and they say"哎哟 很痛""Ouch! That hurts"然后实验人员告诉你And then the experimenter tells you"实验必须继续"The experiment must go on不如你先休息15分钟"Why don't you come back in 15 minutes"你出去15分钟And you go out for 15 minutes等你回来时And you come back again这时是90伏And it's now at 假设你提高到120伏And you go up - let's say - you go up to 120伏 那个人在尖叫And 120, the person is screaming"放我出去 你们没权把我关在这里""Get me out of here! You have no right to keep me here!"你抬头看实验人员 他告诉你And you look up at the experimenter and the experimenter says"实验必须继续"The experiment must go on不如你先休息15分钟?"But why don't you take a 15 minute break?"你们认为这时会怎么样What do you think would happen如果这些人电击人之前有15分钟的时间休息?if people were given 15 minute breaks between shocks?你认为会有63%的人会把电压提高到超过危险水平吗?Do you think 63 percent would go to extremely dangerous and beyond?很可能不会 因为在这15分钟里Probably not, because during these 15 minutes我们不再处于热态we are no longer in a hot state而是处于冷态but rather in a cold state这是引用George Loewenstein的话the words of George Loewenstein当他们处于冷态时 他们会想When they are in a cold state, they'll think"我疯了吗? 我在这里干什么?""Am I out of my mind? What am I doing here?"他们会去打电话报警And they will go and call the police而不是15分钟后再走进去as opposed to going back 15 minutes later and"好的 现在我愿意杀了他们""Ok, now I'm willing to kill them"因为他们在这个实验里就是以为自己杀了这些人which is essentially what they presumably did in that experiment如果他们没有那15分钟But when they didn't have those 15 minutes而是"实验必须继续"when it was "the experiment must go on""实验必须继续""the experiment must go on"他们就会继续it went on他们会为失去自我付出代价And they paid a price of losing themselves我们的现代生活也是这样And this is what happens to us in modern life当然后果没有Milgram的实验not with such dire consequences那么可怕potentially could have been with Milgram而且在现代 即使我们服从权威and we are not doing immoral things我们也没做什么不道德的事as the cases with obedience to authority但通常我们会伤害到自己But we are hurting ourselves very often因为我们随波逐流 遵从主流because we are running around and we are conforming我们做别人认为我们该做的事and we are doing what they think we should do我们做那把声音叫我们做的事we are doing what that voice or voices are telling us to do我们没有做自己想做的事We are not doing what we are meant to be doing你们知道我认为这门课最重要的部分是什么吗?You know what I think the most important part of this class?是课堂和课后作业Its sections and response papers我这么说不是因为谦虚This is not out of modesty没错 我想你们觉得我谦虚yes, I want you to think that I'm modest但这不是我but that's not why I'm这么说的原因why I'm saying it而是因为这时候你们有时间思考It's because that is when you get the time to reflect和你们的助教讨论to talk about it with your teaching fellows和你们的同学讨论with your fellow students思考to think about it你们被迫用额外时间来思考You are "forced" to take a timeout这时你们坐下写课后作业It's when you sit down and write those response papers回答我提出的问题about these questions that I mentioned这时你们真正的独立自我浮现了it's when your real autonomous shining self comes ou这时你跟朋友谈这门课it's when you talk to your friends about this class或者在食堂跟队友分享or your block mates in the dining hall这时你有时间和你的父母分享when you take the time to share with your parents这是独立自我就出现了That's when it is happening最后 正直Finally, integrityNathaniel BrandenNathaniel BrandenNathaniel Branden和他的很多病人这样做过 他是心理治疗师Nathaniel Branden did this with many of his clients - he's a therapist他叫病人来 告诉他们where he would bring them in and tell them"好的 下周 暂停"Ok, for the next week, stop不能说谎 要完全诚实坦白"No lies, Be fully integrated; be fully honest"他发现这个方法 尤其是对于那些And what he found was when he applies to especially people会撒一点谎的病人来说who would lie a little bit more能够提高他们的自尊that enhanced their self esteem我记得在1996年 96或97年I remember back in 1996 - I think it was 96 or 克林顿弹劾案正在审判when the whole Clinton impeachment trial was going onCNN请来DePauloOn CNN they brought on DePaulo她是维珍尼亚大学的一位教授she is a professor at University of Virginia她专门研究说谎and she does research on lying他们采访了她 那是第一次And they interviewed her and it was the first time我接触到她的研究that I was exposed to her work她在CNN上说她的研究发现And she said on CNN that her research shows that基本上所有人都说谎 很多时候都是一些小谎basically everyone lies - many times little lies为了让别人觉得自己很厉害intended to impress others很多时候是大谎many times, bigger lies她发现And what she found was that人平均每天说三个谎people lie in average 3 times a day当我听到的时候And when I heard it我轻笑了一声I scoffed, I said"也许其他人每天说三次谎"Wel, maybe other people lie three times a day但我不说谎"I don't lie"我解释一下为什么说我不撒谎And let me explain to you why I don't lie这是真的And this is true因为我读大学时写的毕业论文Because I wrote my senior thesis in college就是说诚实是会带来好处的on the concept of honesty pays我当时既学心理也学哲学I was a joint philosophy and psychology concentrator我对道德 自尊 动机感兴趣was interested in ethics, self esteem, motivation我根据研究And what I showed based on research根据亚里士多德 亚当·史密斯的哲学著作based on philosophical works by Aristotle, by Adam Smith发现每次我们说谎 欺骗 不诚实时that we pay a high psychological and emotional price whenever we lie要付出巨大的whenever we cheat心理和情绪代价whenever we are dishonest所以我跟自己说And then I said to myself"让我试试DePaulo的方法""But let me try DePaulo's exercise."她的方法就是叫人讲完一段对话后What she does is have people evaluate their conversations马上评估有哪些是真的 有哪些是说谎的for honest or dishonest content right after it finishes趁他们还清楚记得so when it's still fresh in their mind自己说过什么what they talked about他们会写一本日记So they keep a journal完全匿名的which is completely anonymous所以我想So I said"我会写 虽然我不说谎""But I'm gonna do , even though I don't lie"因为我知道说谎的后果because I know the consequences of lying因为我的论文就是写这个的because I wrote my thesis on it我是诚实这个课题的专家I'm an expert on honesty我说我会写日记的I said I'll still do it因为我想实验一下Cause I like to try experiments就在我写日记的期间As it happens有一天晚上我出去约会I went on a date that night一个我没见过的人 不是Ariannasomeone whom I never met before - was not Arianna是我妈妈给我介绍的someone that was whom my mom set me up with我妈和她妈说我们在同一间学校My mom and her mom talked together in the same school然后我听说了她的一些很棒的事迹And I heard wonderful things about her我很激动I was very excited我们见了面以后就更加激动了and became even more excited when we met我们坐下来 吃饭聊天 很愉快And we were sitting down and having a lovely dinner and talking她是一个经济学家And she is an economist非常成功的经济学家very successful economist她问我是做什么的And she asked me what I was doing我告诉她我是心理学家and I told her that I was a psychologist我用我全部的心理知识在她面前表现自己And I was really impressing her with all my knowledge of psychology她说"我也对心理学感兴趣"And she said:"You know I'm also interested in psychology."我说"这一定会很顺利"And I said:"This is going really well"我自己心里说的 不是跟她说To myself, not to her我学到了教训 刚开始约会时不要说这样的话I learned not to say those things on earlier dates我们坐下来…So we were sitting down and - you know要学会失败learn to fail我们坐下来聊天So we were sitting down and talking然后她说Then she said"我刚读到一个心理学家的著作""Oh, you know,I just read about the psychologist"她说了这个人的名字And she said the name非常著名的一个心理学家you know, it's a very famous psychologis"你听说过他吧?""You know him,right?"我完全不知道Now I didn't have the faintest clue who was she她说的是谁 完全不知道who she was talking about - no idea我记得我呆了一下And I remember pausing for a second微笑地看着她and looking at her and just smiling"嗯嗯""Hmm, mHmmm"然后我们继续聊And the conversation continued to flow我没有注意到自己说谎了Now I would not have noticed this但后来我回到家except for the fact that afterwards I went home回想这次的对话and went over the conversation我说"慢着 我刚才跟她说谎了"Then I said "Hey wait a minut, I just lied to her!"从那时起And ever since then我就经常这么做 我指的是说谎I've been doing this regularly - lying that is不 我经常这么做No, I've been doing this regularly从那时起Ever since then我就坚持磨练自己的正直I've been keeping doing the integrity exercise用DePaulo说的方法that DePaulo talks about用Nathaniel Branden说的方法that Nathaniel Branden talks about非常留意我说的话to be very conscious about my conversations我这么说是为了表现自己Am I just saying things to impress而说的假话吗?which are not authentic?我是不是说了小谎?Am I having those little lies?因为你们要明白 当我们说实话时Because you see, when we are telling the truth我们给自己传达了一个信息the message that we communicate to ourselves我们给自己传达的信息是the message that we communicate to ourselves我的话是有价值的is that my words are worthy我的话很重要 我很重要my words are important; I matter当我们不说实话时And when we don't do that当我们说谎时when we tell lies或者我们想不停地表现自己时or we are about impressing constantly我们是在说"这样的我不够好"we are saying "I'm not good enough as I am."我需要成为另一个人 让别人来喜欢我I need to be someone else so that the other person likes我需要知道这个心理学家I need to know that psychologist不然她就不会喜欢我because otherwise she won't like me而不是做真实的自己instead of being authentic and real1374选择被认同而不是被了解instead of being known rather than validated用这个方法坚持一周and doing it and being conscious of it for a week  at a time直到行为改变了我们的态度until the behavior changes our attitude我开始更重视我的话and I begin to value my words much more当我跟自己传达 我是谁when I communicate myself - who I am而不是想着让别人觉得自己很厉害时rather than trying to impress others当我肯定自己时When I assert myself当我时不时地说"不"时when I say no at times这样我就能简化我的生活so that I can simplify my life a little bit当我该说是的时候说是when I say yes when it's appropriate即使这个"是"不是很受欢迎even it's not the most popular yes in the world但我应该这样说but it's right for me还要从时间和空间上把这个方法扩展开来And it's about expanding it in time as well as in space首先从我自己开始It is started first of all by myself为什么写日记这么有用?why does journaling help so much?为什么有移情心的治疗师Why does therapy with an empathic therapist他们的治疗这么有效?why does it work so well?因为我们活出了自我Because we are ourselves我们没有想着在治疗师面前表现自己we don't try impress the therapist一段时间后 我们打开心扉After a while we open up我们没有想着在日记里表现自己We don't try to impress our journal我们活出了自我We are ourselves从让我们感觉良好的日记扩展到And expanding it from our journal which makes us feel good亲近的关系和人to close relationships, to others从一天一次对话中练习正直from doing it one day one conversation at a time到坚持一周 然后坚持一生to a week of integrity treatment so to speak to lifelong想象一下 过这样的生活Imagine leading this life当你不用再不停地表达或表现自己时how freed up do we feel when you no longer need to express我们会感到多自由or impress ourselves constantly我们能够被了解where we can just be known能够活出自我where we can just be ourselves这样会多轻松how much lighter多有力量how much more power我们会觉得多正直和真实how much more integrity and authenticity we will experience我们会多快乐?how much happier will we be?我想在下课前读一段Melissa Christino的日记I want to end by reading you an excerpt from Melissa Christino's journal是她在她的毕业论文中引用的which she cited in her senior thesis当然这是得到她允许的This, of course is with her permissionMelissa Christino是哈佛本科毕业生 2002届Melissa Christino was an undergraduate here, class of 她是这样写的And this is what she writes"你真正的潜力"Your true potential lies way埋藏在你的灵魂深处way down in the depths of your soul...在你腹部最底处in the pit of your stomach在你的知识和紧张触及不到的地方past your knowledge, beyond your nervousness埋藏在你的恐惧和焦虑之下and buried under your fears and anxieties虽然它隐藏起来了As hidden as it may be但它还在那里it is still there我知道 因为我以前感受过它的存在I know it's there because I've felt it before我知道别人也有and I know it's there in others too因为我见过别人做过奇迹一般的事because I've seen others perform miracles我们体内都有一股无可匹敌的潜力 散发着微弱的光芒There is a faint glow of unparalleled potential in all of us当我们找到它时 它就会发出万丈光芒"and when we find it — it shine."我们每个人都有这丝微光It's there in each and every one of us - this glow如果我们助长它 培养它 它就会壮大And if we feed it, if we cultivate it, it grows它就会壮大到超越自己And it grows to the level that expands beyond the self这时候 像Warren Bennis这样的人where people like Warren Bennis像曼德拉这样的人where people like Nelson Mandela像Anita Roddick这样的人where people like Anita Roddick像特蕾莎修女这样的人 他们的存在people like mother Teresa - just their presence他们的存在 就能为别人散发光芒just their presence, their being shines a light onto others现在我想这样做So what I'd like you to do now只剩四分钟we have 4 more minute我想这样做here's what I'd like to do now我会放一首歌给大家听I'm going to play a song for yo通常我会在上课前放的usually played at the beginning但今天我想在最后才放I want to play it at the end today如果你们喜欢的话If you feel comfortable可以闭上眼睛 听歌词you can close your eyes and listen to the words of the song它们对你有什么意义and what they mean to you对你的生活有什么意义what they mean in the context of your life所以如果你们喜欢So if you feel comfortable闭上眼睛听close your eyes, and listen听听以下的歌词really listen to the following words我就是我I am what I am我独一无二I am my own special creation看我一眼So come take a look对我嗤之以鼻Give me the hook或为我鼓掌Or the ovation这是我的世界It's my world我想拥有一点骄傲That I want to have a little pride in我的世界My world在这里我不用躲藏And it's not a place I have to hide in生命毫无价值Life's not worth a damn直到你能说Till you can say我就是我I am what I am睁开眼睛Open your eyes!来吧 上来C'mon!
