幸福课 中英字幕 [第22课]自尊与自我实现
哈佛学习障碍协会
Harvard Learning Challenged Association
受到这门课的启发 我们将举行一个论坛
And we are hosting a forum inspired by this class
名叫学习缺陷
entitled Learning Disabilities
学习障碍和积极心理学
Learning Challenges and Positive Psychology
很多校内学生都有学习缺陷
A lot of students on campus are registered with learning disabilities
有些甚至有学习障碍
and even more have learning challenges
包括学习困难和长期拖延症
which can include a difficulty studying or chronic procrastination
而且 很多学习障碍
Also, a lot of learning disabilities
都与抑郁症高发率和低自尊有关
are associated with higher rates of depression and low self-esteem
所以在这个论坛上 我们会问
So in this forum, we hope to ask questions like
"如何积极看待学习障碍?"
"How can we think positively about learning disabilities?"
"我们如何用积极心理学
And "How can we use positive psychology
进一步探索这片研究领域?"
to further explore this field of studying?"
欢迎大家参加 不管是你有学习障碍
All are welcome, whether you have learning challenge
还是你的朋友
or your friend does
或者你最近遇到学习困难
or you just have a tough time studying
或者你只是感兴趣
or you are just interested
都请来参加
Please come and join us
时间很方便

And I hope to see you at some of our events next year
我们今天早上和班上的助教吃了早餐
So we had a breakfast this morning with the teaching staff of this class
这是我们最后一次的早餐聚餐
It was our final breakfast get-together
我有点伤心
And I'm a little bit sad
希望上完这节课后我能开心一点
So hopefully I'll be happier by the end of the class
今天我们会讲完自尊
Today we'll finish up on self-esteem
下节课是我们最后一次上课
and the next time is the last time we meet
至少是这个学期
for this semester at least
我会总结一下我们讲过的内容
And I'll summarize what we have done
我们讲过的
where we have been
和我们将要讲的内容
and all the places that we will go
先回顾一下我们讲过的
Just a recap on what we did
就在幻灯片上
which is on the slide now
有很多研究
There's been a lot of research
有很多观点都说了自尊有多重要
a lot of talk of how important self-esteem is
自尊确实很重要
and it is important
有研究表明它与我们的健康
There's research suggesting that it's connected to our well being
成功有关 低自尊通常与犯罪
to our success that is inversely related to crime
00:04:50,600 --&gt; 00:04:52,400
药物滥用
substance abuse
心情低落 焦虑 抑郁有关
unhappiness, anxiety, depression
所以自尊很重要 这我们知道
So self-esteem is important - we know that
但是在自尊这个课题里 也不是天下太平的
However, not all was well in self-esteem land
我们上节课讲过了
as we discussed last time
问题之一就是自相矛盾的证据
Part of the problem is that there is contradictory evidence
一方面
On the one hand
高自尊的人通常都仁慈 慷慨和富有同情心
self-esteem is associated with benevolence and generosity and empathy
但另一方面
on the other hand
高自尊的人又会表现出敌意
high self-esteem has been shown to be associated with hostility
缺乏合作精神 有抵触情绪
lack of cooperation, defensiveness
另一个问题就是人们误解
There's also misunderstanding about or
自尊对表现的影响
about how self-esteem affects performance
对幸福的影响
how it affects happiness
以及当中的原因
and where that comes from
自尊的矛盾
The paradox of self-esteem
有时候我们觉得自己表现得很优秀
Sometimes we feel like we are doing so well
受到很多赞扬
we are getting so many accolades
但自尊上升后 很快又回落到基本水平
our self-esteem increases only to go back to its base level
甚至更糟
only worse
因为我们要尽更大努力
because now we have to do even more
才能让自尊回到基本水平
to come back to our base level of self-esteem
我们要得到更多的赞扬
have to get more accolades
取得更多的成就
more achievements
做什么都不够了
Nothing is enough anymore
所以有证明表明自尊的来源
So there are these contradictory evidence
以及它的后果
where self-esteem comes from
存在矛盾
and its consequences
解释这些矛盾的方法之一就是借鉴别人的研究
And one of the ways to explain it is by drawing on the work
例如Maslow
of people like Maslow
Nathaniel Branden
people like Nathaniel Branden
或者Carl Rogers, Rollo May Lovinger
people like Carl Rogers, Rollo May. Lovinger
看看我们能怎么分解自尊的基本构成
to see how we can perhaps break down self-esteem into its components
这就是我的论文的内容
that's what my dissertation did
也是我上节课跟大家讲的内容
this is what I presented to you in the previous class
基本上就是讲了自尊这个领域里的研究人员的观点
basically take the ideas of the select field researchers
那些思考这个问题的人
who had been thinking about it
例如马路对面的教育学院的Robert Kegan
people like Robert Kegan across the road from the Ed school
他研究自尊的角度更倾向于发展心理学
thinking about self-esteem more developmentally
我给大家介绍了那个渐成模型 渐成
And I presented the epigenetic model – epigenetic
再说一次 它的意思就是必须实现了一层
once again, meaning that one level has to be fulfilled
或者至少部分实现了一层 才能去到下一层
or at least partly fulfilled before we can go the next level
128
这三层分别是依赖型自尊
And the three levels are dependent self-esteem
独立型自尊
independent self-esteem
和无条件型自尊
and unconditional self-esteem
依赖型自尊 它有两个构成部分
Dependent self-esteem - the two components of it
首先
first of all
有高度依赖性自尊的人时刻需要他人的赞扬
person with high dependence needs the accolades of others constantly
不管是选择职业 还是决定下午做什么这样的小事
chooses whether it's a career path or what to do this afternoon
都是根据他人的认同来做决定的
based on how much approval that will gain him or her
有依赖型自尊的人
Person with dependent self-esteem
在能力感方面
when it comes to competence
总是拿自己跟别人比较
always compares him or herself to others
我比他们好还是差? 比他们优秀还是不如他们?
Am I better or am I worse? Superior or inferior?
独立型自尊是一种取决于自我的自尊
Independent self-esteem is self-esteem that's contingent on the self
这样的人在评价自己时
in terms of how I evaluate myself
用的是自己的意见
that's my internal voice that's speaking
他们的能力感取决于
In terms of how my levels of competence are determined
自己认为自己进步了多少
it depends on how much I have improved
改善了多少
how much better I've got
觉得自己的潜力发挥了多少
how much I feel that I have fulfilled my potential
这就是独立型自尊
That's independent self-esteem
并不取决于他人的言论或想法
not contingent on what other people say or think
无条件型自尊是最高层次的自尊
Unconditional self-esteem is the highest level
也就是Maslow所说的"自我实现"
the level that Maslow would talk about - "the self-actualization"
David Schnarch所说的"分化良好型"
what David Schnarch talks about as "differentiated"
想被了解 而不是被认可
or at the level of being known rather than desiring to be validated
无条件型自尊是指我们的自尊高到
Unconditional self-esteem is when our self-esteem is high enough
让我们对自己感觉很好
we feel good enough about ourselves
所以我们并不在乎别人怎么看自己
not to be concerned with evaluations with others
甚至不在乎自己怎么看自己
or even with self evaluations
在比较方面
In terms of comparison
我们不会比较 我们是相互依存的
we don't compare; we are inter-dependent
相互联系的
connected to others
我上节课举的一个例子是写书
So the example that I gave last time is of a book
假设我出版一本书 我是一个高度依赖型自尊的人
Let's say I publish a book and I have high dependent self-esteem
首先 我写这本书
First of all, I write it
我出版这本书 是为了得到赞扬
I publish it so that I can get accolades
我的首要动机是获得外界认同
My primary motivation is external approval
我的首要动机是想出版一本
My primary motivation is wanting to bring out a book
比别人的书都好的书
that will be better than the other books out there
相比较而获得的能力感 以及取决于外界
so relative competence as well as externally other-determined
又假设我写了一本书
So if I bring in a book and write a book
我是一个高度独立型自尊的人
and I have high independent self-esteem
我写了书 我自己评价
I write it and I evaluate it myself
"这是一本好书"或者"这本书不怎么样
"this is good work, " or "this is not so good
需要修改"
needs improvement
在比较方面
In terms of comparison
我跟自己比较 "我比起刚开始写时进步了很多
I compare to myself - "I've improved a lot since I started writing
这本书比我之前一本要好
This book is actually better than my previous book
我的书写得更真实了"
My work has become more authentic, more real. "
这是独立型自尊的评价
That's independent self-esteem evaluation
无条件型自尊
Unconditional self-esteem
是我们所知的最高层次自尊
the highest level that we know of:
我写了一本书 我不在乎评价
I write a book and I'm not concerned about evaluation
不管它是好是坏 我当然想变得越来越好
whether it's good or bad - of course I want to be better and better
但这并不影响我对自己的感觉
but that doesn't affect how I feel about myself
我就是我
I simply exist
我写了这本书 我处于心流状态
I write the book; I'm in a state of flow
我体验这种经历
experiencing the experience
至于这本书是不是比别人的好
In terms of whether it's better than others
或者比我以前写的好
or better than I've written
这都不重要
it doesn't matter
我高兴的是
What I'm happy about
我写成了一本书
what makes me happy is bringing a good book into existence
如果别人也写了一本书
And I would be as happy
我也会同样替他感到高兴
if someone else wrote the book
193
别人写了一本更好的书 我会同样高兴 甚至更高兴
I'd be as happy or happier that someone else wrote a better book
这本书更能帮助到人
that can help others more
这个模型有很重要的一点是需要明白的
Important thing to understand about this model
我们从很小的年纪开始就有这三层自尊
the three levels is that we all have all three basically from a very young age
并非只有达赖喇嘛或特蕾沙修女
It's not that the Dalai Lama or Mother Teresa
曼德拉或者玛格丽特米德
or Nelson Mandela or Margaret Mead
这样的名人
that people who we know have been
才是自我实现的人
are self-actualized
他们并不是不在乎别人的看法
it's not that they don't care about what other people say
但他们
However, they are mostly
大部分时候
most of their lives, most of the time
都是自己决定的 做自己相信的事
self-determined - do what they believe in
和他人相互联系
feel a sense of connection to others
想让世界变得更美好
want to make the world a better place
但他们并非不在乎
But it's not that they don't care
并非他们评价自己时不会跟自己比较
it's not that they don't evaluate themselves relative to themselves
也不会跟他人比较
or relative to others
这是人的天性
That's part of human nature
我犯过一个错误 当我开始这个研究时
My error, when I started with this research
我跟自己说
was that I said to myself
"好的 我想有独立型自尊"
"OK,I just want to have independent
当后来我明白无条件型自尊是什么时
and later when I understood what unconditional self-esteem
我说"我想有无条件型自尊"
I said, "Wel, I want to have unconditional self-esteem."
我把这两种自尊列为好的
And I situated those two on the good side
把依赖型自尊列为坏的
and dependent self-esteem, bad
结果呢?
And what then happened?
只加剧了我对他人的依赖
It only intensified my dependency on others
因为当我们有违天性时
Because when we fight nature
天性就会跟我们作对 我们赢不了
nature fights back and we can't win
就像第二节课一样
You know, it's like going back to the second class
如果我跟自己说
If I say to myself
"Tal 别紧张 别紧张 别心急"
"Tal, don't be nervou, Don't be nervo, Don't be anxiou."
结果呢? 我看到粉红色大象出来了
What happens? The pink elephants begin to come out
我变得更焦虑更紧张了
And I become even more anxious and more nervous
但当我接受这种天性时
whereas I accept it is part of my nature
放任它 不强求自己
Let it be – permission to be human
它就顿时威力大减
It loses a lot of its vitality and force and control
因为我可以说
Cause I can say
"好的 这个人不喜欢我的书 我无所谓
"OK. Yes, I care that this person didn't like my book
不喜欢我的课 无所谓"
didn't like my class
我接受它 这是天性 我会伤心
And I accepted it, It's nature, It hurts me
我当然想他们都喜欢
I would much rather that they all like it
但转念一想 我就想通了
But I can move on then, and said
"我要怎样做才能活出自我?
"OK,what would the most authentic life that I can lead?
我作为一个老师要怎样才能被了解
How can I the teacher who is known as opposed
而不是整天想着得到别人的认同?"
to constantly concerned about validation?"
积极接受 回顾一下
Active acceptance. Revisited
接受我的天性 然后决定
Accepting my nature and then deciding
最合适的做法是什么
what would the most appropriate action to take
我的榜样之一是Warren Bennis
One of the, my role models is Warren Bennis
Warren Bennis在领导才能这个领域
Warren Bennis has done a lot of research and a lot of speaking
做过很多研究 演讲和工作
and a lot of work in the area of leadership
他先在南加州大学教旁听课
He teaches audit in University of Southern California
后来才来哈佛和麻省理工
was before he was at Harvard and MIT
他来哈佛商学院教了三年
And he came to Harvard Business School for three years
第一年 作为一个客座教授
and the first year - as a visiting professor
第一年我上了他的班
The first year I took his class
一次非常特别的经历
which was an extraordinary experience
第二年他教那个班时
The second year when he taught it
我当了他的助教
I was his teaching assistant
我经常和他一起工作 互动
And I used to work a lot with him and interact with him
我经常为Warren折服
and was constantly amazed by Warren
Warren当时80岁 他现在83岁了
Warren, at the time was 80 years old - now he's 
他走进教室时 整间教室都亮了起来
would walk into the room and the room would light up
他的微笑 姿势 直率
It was his smile, his posture, his openness
他丰富的表达
his expressiveness
都是为了和同学发生互动
was there about his interacting with people
他的一举一动让其他人
and making the other person just by being there
对自己感觉更好了
feel better about themselves
他自信坚强
And he was confident and strong
我把这样的人视为自我实现的人
and what I would classify as self-actualized as a person
他有很高的无条件自尊
with very high unconditional self-esteem
我们走得很近 他在很多方面都给了我帮助
And we became very close and he helped me in many areas
最大的帮助就是他活出自我 我观察他
most of all just by being himself - me observing him
学习他 吸收他给这个世界带来的东西
learning from him, assimilating what he had to give the world
吸收他每天给数百万读他的书的人
and what he was giving day in and day out
听他演讲的人
to thousands and millions of people who have read his books
和他有过接触的人
who have been to his lectures
所带来的知识
who've had the privilege of interacting with him
几年后 有一天
And one day after a couple of years
我是他的助教
I was his TA
我们关系很亲近
and we were close
我跟他说
I said to him
"Warren 你是怎么变成现在这样的?"
"Warren, how is it that you are like this?"
你是怎么变成现在这样的?
How is it that you are like this?
他的回应时 把手放在我肩膀
And his response was put his hand on my shoulder
看着我 带着一个平静
looked at me with his calm
接受 慷慨的微笑 说
accepting, giving smile, and said
"Tal 我不是一出生就这样的"
"Tal. I wasn't always like this"
他就只说了这一句
And that's where he left it
这就是我需要听到的答案
And this is what I needed to hear
因为在他的回答里
Because in his response
有很多重要的信息
where two very important - many more
而最重要的两个信息是
but two very important messages
第一个 他是慢慢进步成这样的
the first message is that it evolves
需要时间 你不会在20岁时 或者40岁时
it takes time; you don't become third level
一夜之间 去到第三层自尊
self-actualized individual overnight at the age of 
变成一个自我实现的人
or even at the age of 
需要时间 需要下功夫
It takes time; it takes work; it takes self-awareness
需要一次次跌倒和站起来
it takes falling down and getting up
学会失败
learning to fail
然后从失败中学习
then learning from that failure
需要学习接受自己
It takes learning to accept oneself
需要敞开心扉 接受伤害 犯错
it takes being open and being vulnerable and making mistakes
需要做一个彻彻底底的人
it takes being human, fully human
我不是一出生就这样的
I was not always like this
他的回答中第二个信息是
The second message that I got from this
Warren很真诚
is that Warren was genuine
他很真实 他没有跟我说
He was real. He didn't say to me
"Tal 别夸我
"Oh Tal, stop
我也不是很厉害 过奖了"
Not really. Come on. Thank you"
他没有这样
But no
他很真诚 他知道自己的价值
He was real. He knows his worth
他自信
He's confident
他没有虚伪的谦虚
There was no false modesty involved
这让我想起
and it reminded me
当我开始思考自尊时
that when I started to think about self-esteem
自尊的真正意义
and the true meaning of self-esteem
Branden的著作中所写的意义
as you read in Branden's work
对了 他和Nathaniel Branden是好朋友
by the way, he and Nathaniel Branden are good friends
当我开始读Branden的著作时
When I started reading Branden
当我明白真正的自尊是什么时
and when I realized what real self-esteem was about
我明白有高自尊的人都是谦虚的
I realized that people with high levels of self-esteem are modest
你不需要显摆
You don't have the need to show off
你们知道 自大
You know, arrogance
自恋是自尊的对立
narcissism is the exact opposite of self-esteem
目中无人 自以为是
hubris, foolish pride is the exact opposite
跟真正意义上的自我感是完全对立的
of what a true sense of self is
所以当我明白了这点以后
So when I understood that
我的一个重要目标就是变得
one of my important goals was to become
谦虚 最重要的目标
more importantly to be - modest
所以我越来越觉得
And it was incredibly important for me
要让大家都知道我很谦虚
that everyone knows how modest I was
英国哲学家Francis Bacon说
You know. Francis Bacon, the British philosopher
谦虚不过是换了个法子在显摆而已
said that modesty is but another form of ostentation
这句话用在我身上最合适不过了
And for me that certainly was the case
但对别人来说不总是这样
it's not always the case
我认为Warren Bennis是真正的谦虚
I think Warren Bennis is modest and truly modest
我认为曼德拉
I think Nelson Mandela
当他谦虚时 他是真正的谦虚
when he is being modest, he really is modest
但问题是 你怎样才能达到那种层次的谦虚?
But the question is: how do you get to that level of modesty?
你要达到那种层次的谦虚 方法就是活出自我
And you get to this level of modesty by being authentic
活得真实
by being real
走完这个过程
by going through the process
这个过程就像我们上节课说的那样
And the process in many ways as we described last time
就像学习走路
is like learning how to walk
我们刚生出来时
Initially when we are born
我们连走路是什么都不知道
we have no idea what walking even is
但慢慢地
Then later on
我们能站起来
we are able to get up
但我们需要别人扶着
but we need support either of another person
或者靠着什么东西
or something to lean on
例如 我们靠着桌子小心地走出第一步
And we take our first precarious steps around a desk, for example
慢慢地我们可以自己走了
And after a while we can walk without help
但我们还是要想着每一步怎么迈
But we are still thinking about every step
我们跌倒了就再爬起来
and we fall down and get up again
学会失败 或者一错再错
learn to fail or fail to learn
然后我们继续走
And then we continue walking
我们心里时刻想着怎么抬起这条腿
and we are very conscious of how we pick up this leg
当你观察婴儿学走路时
When you watch a baby learn how to walk
会觉得很神奇
it's fascinating
他们需要调动很多东西 才能完成
So many things have come together for this simple
这么简单的一个动作
seemingly simple action
过了一段时间后
And then after a while
婴儿变得更自信了
the baby becomes more confident
她开始跑了
And she begins to run
她不再想着怎么走或跑
And she no longer has to think about walking or running
因为她自然地
because then she naturally
就会走了
she simply walks
自我感也是这样 一开始
Same with the sense of self: initially
我们没有自我感
we have no sense of self
区分不开"我"和妈妈
there's no differentiation between the "me" and the mom
或者世界上其他物件
or other objects in the world
慢慢地我们发展出自我感
Gradually, we develop a sense of self
但这个自我感是完全依赖外界的
but that sense of self is completely dependent
不管是身体上还是心理上
physically as well as psychologically
我们都依赖于父母
we are dependent on our parents
重要的大人
significant adults
哥哥或姐姐
older sibling
然后过了一段时间
And then after a while
通常是到我们进入青春期后
that usually happens when we are teenagers
我们开始获得独立
we begin to assert our independence
这时我们开始渴望
That's when we begin to desire
听到自己的声音
want to hear our own voice
想让别人听到自己的声音
want to make our own voice heard
青春期这段时间很难
That's the difficult teenage years
对青少年来说难
difficult for the teenager
对父母来说也难
difficult for the parent
但这是自然的
But it's natural
是进化的必经步骤
It's part of evolution
这时候我们需要我们的界限
And we need our boundaries at that time
但同时
And at the same time
我们有时候又需要打破界限
we need to sometimes break boundaries
我们需要试探现实
We need to test reality
确定自我
Assert ourselves
然后随着时间过去
And then over time
如果我们这么做
when we do that
随着时间过去 我们同时开始一个新过程
over time we begin a new process simultaneously
这个过程就是真正的分化
And that is the process of real differentiation
这时候独立的自我变得太强烈
where the independent self becomes so strong
我们能够和他们联系
that we are able to connect to others as well
再一次 引用回讲恋爱课的内容
Once again, going back to relationship
Nathaniel Branden说过 我们越独立
Nathaniel Branden: the more independent we become
我们就越互相依存
the more interdependent we can be
然后我们进步 这需要很长时间
And then we evolve and that takes a long time
如果我们没有依赖的一面 例如
And if we have missed out on the dependent side – for example
如果我们年少时没有得到任何赞扬
if we didn't get any accolades and any praise
或者用Carl Rogers的话来说无条件的
and unconditional self-regard in the words of Carl Rogers
自我关注
when we are younger
我们就会有这个需求 回忆一下那个渐成模型
then we have that need - remember the model of epigeneti
我们不能跳过一层
we can't jump over a stage
通常我们需要一个治疗师
And very often it would take a therapist
帮助我们找到无条件的自我关注
to provide us with unconditional self-regard
这样我们就能到达下一层
so that we can go to the next level
或者我们需要一段关系
Or we need a relationship
或几段关系帮助我们培养无条件的自我关注
or relationships where we cultivate unconditional self-regard
这样我们就能到达下一层
so that we can go to the next stage
如果…
And if we were
如果我们在青少年时期
when we were teenagers
不停地有人叫我们安静
constantly told to be quiet
守规矩 阻止我们确立自我
to behave, prevented from asserting ourselves
活出自我
being ourselves
那么我们就不可能顺利地
then we are unlikely to get to the next level
到达下一层
in a smooth way
通常在以后的生活里 我们需要做的事就是
And then very often later on in life we need to do
首先要确立自己
that first to assert ourselves
就像青少年那样
like teenagers did or do
这样就能到达下一层
so that we can make it to the next level
但不管怎样 这个过程不会顺顺利利
But regardless this is not a smooth transition
为什么? 因为天下没有完美的父母
Why? Because there are no perfect parents
因为天下没有完美的成长环境
because there is no perfect environment
没有完美的老师帮助我们自然而顺利地
there are no perfect teachers and for us to evolve naturally
通过这些阶段
and smoothly through the stages
这是不现实的
it's just unrealistic
在地球上不存在
doesn't exis, not here on earth
我们在艰苦中随着时间进步
And then we evolve over time through the hardships
克服困难
through the difficulties
犯错 跌倒
making mistakes, falling
再爬起来
getting up again
慢慢地独立的自我
gradually the interdependent self
无条件的自尊开始浮现
the unconditional self-esteem emerges
我们对自己更有自信
And we feel much more comfortable in our skin
Maslow说他没见过
Maslow said that he didn't find people
有45岁以下就自我实现的人
below the age of 45 who were self-actualized
即使是那些自我实现的人
And even those self-actualized people
仍然有残留的一丝丝独立型自尊
still have remnants of independent
和依赖型自尊
as well as dependent self-esteem
这种自尊是不会彻底消失的
It never really goes away
但它这时变弱了
But it's only weaker now
它不占主导地位 这时的人不再执着于
It's not dominant; it's not what they are about
获得更多赞扬
the next accolade, the next praise
当别人不喜欢他们时就伤心欲绝
being devastated when someone doesn't like them
当自己不是最好时就伤心欲绝
being devastated when they are not the best
他们接受了 他们会说
They accept it. They say
"赢了固然是好 赢不了也无所谓"
"O, it would be nice to win this."
然后他们会继续前进
And then they move on
他们会问
And they ask
"我怎样才能让世界变得更美好?
"How can I make the world better place?
我怎么把积极情绪带给别人?"
How can I be a conduit for positive emotions?"
Maslow没见过45岁以下自我实现的人
Maslow didn't find anyone below the age of 
Schnarch说要到五六十岁时
Schnarch talks about how it's in the 50s and 60s
人才分化
that the individuals become differentiated
才到酝酿出一段关系中最高层次的感情
and where the highest potential for passion is within a relationship
需要时间
It takes time
我不是一生下来就这样的
I was not always this way
正如Bennis指出 不是一生下来就这样的
it was not always like this as Bennis pointed out
非常重要的一个道理
very important lesson
很多人都问这个理论是不是放之四海皆准
Many people ask about the universal nature of this theory
因为你们知道 独立
because you know independence is very much
或者说个人主义 是西方文化
or individualism is very much a Western construct
或者说美国文化 西欧文化
or American, West European construct
如果你去非洲 这会很不同
You know you go to Africa - very differen
群体的概念
the concept of we of a group
比个体的概念更重要
is much more central to who they are
如果大家去亚洲
You go to Asia
"我们"的概念 集体的概念
the concept of the we, collectivism
群体的概念比个体的概念更重要
the group is much more central to who they are
那在其他地方呢?
So what about other areas?
这是一个专属西方的理论吗?
Is this a Western centric theory?
答案是"不一定"
And the answer is "not necessarily"
如果我们的目标是完全自我实现
You see, if our goal is to become fully actualized
或者用Rogers的话来说
or to strive toward that
在成为一个人的过程中
to be in the process of becoming a person
向着这个目标奋进
in the words of Rogers
那么最后
then the final
互相依存这个最后阶段对所有文化来说都一样
that final stage of interdependence is same in all cultures
所有文化都重视这一点
All cultures value it
他们同样重视这一点
They value it just the same
不同文化的人 这个过程可能看起来不同
the process may look different for a person in Japan
日本人 美国人
and for a person in United States
埃及人 以色列人
for a person in Israel or Egypt
津巴布韦人 都各不相同
compared to a person living in Zimbabwe
这个过程看起来不同
The process may look different
但它有很多相同之处
However, it will have many similarities
我在第三节课时讲过达赖喇嘛
Remember I talked about the Dalai Lama on the third class or so
他说他发现西方心理的一个问题是
who said that one of the problems he sees in Western psychology
我们太着重文化差异了
is that we focus too much on cultural differences
达赖喇嘛是一个
And again, Dalai Lama is very
文化触觉非常敏锐的人
extremely sensitive culturally
他说差异确实存在 我们需要学习它们
But he says there are differences; we need to study them
但与此同时
At the same time
我们更需要学习相同之处
we need to study even more so the similarities
正是这些相同之处把我们联合起来
that which brings us together
团结起来
that unites us
而且相同之处多不胜数
And there are a lot of similarities
希望不久的将来会有越来越多人研究
And hopefully soon there'll be more and more research
这个话题 并把它应用于不同的文化中
on this topic applying it to different cultures and twigging
看看它与西方文化以外的世界有什么联系
and seeing how it relates outside the Western tradition
因为我等一下提到的大部分研究
Cause most of the research that I'll mention in a minute
都是在美国做的
has been done in United States
有一些是在英国
some of them in UK
如果能看看别的地方这个过程是如何的 那会很有趣
Will be interesting to see what the process looks like elsewhere
但它的核心是
But at its core, at its core
相似多于差异
it is much more similar than different
为什么独立很重要?
Why is it important to be independent?
为什么我们要奋力地达到独立阶段?
Why is it that we should strive for this evolution?
为什么我们不应该遵从他人
Shouldn't we stay of the conformity
依赖外界?
dependence level?
我的理由 以及很多研究结果
Now I will argue and the research
还有很多历史事件都表明
shows as well as historical incidents show that
培养独立是我们培养相互依存的
it is important to cultivate independence as a way
一个重要途径
to cultivate interdependence
首先
First of all
因为道德行为
because of moral behavior
如果大家想想历史上最可怕的暴行
if you think about the worst atrocities throughout history
历史上最可怕的暴行
the worst atrocities throughout history
正是那些遵从他人
were conducted by people conforming
服从权威的人犯下的
by obedience to authority
那些种族主义或民族主义的信念和行为导致的
and by racist or ethnocentric beliefs and behaviors
现在来看看我刚才提到的三件事
Now look at these three things that I just
服从权威 一个人
obedience to authority - a person
如果有很高的依赖性自尊
with high dependence self-esteem
就越有可能服从
is much more likely to be obedient
权威人物
to an authority figure
为什么? 因为这样的人寻求赞扬
Why? Because he or she seeks accolades
他们寻求认同
they seek approval
他们没有强烈的自我感
They don't feel strong enough themselves
他们需要一个有魅力的领袖告诉他们
They need that very charismatic leader to tell them
"你真棒 你真厉害 你太了不起了"
"Oh,you are fine, You are OK, You are superior"
因为他们的自我感依赖于这些赞扬
Because that's where their sense of self is dependent on
如果我们需要不停地获得群体的赞扬
because we are much more likely to conform to what a group is doing
我们就更可能遵循群体的做法
if we need constantly the accolades of that group
大家想想Milgram的实验
You think about the Milgram experiment
Asch的实验
you think about Asch experiments
上过第15节和第1节的同学
those of you who've taken Psych 15,or Psych 
大家想想种族主义 什么是种族主义?
You think about racism. What is racism?
种族主义就是通过比较一些外在因素
Racism is about comparison and wanting to assert superiority
来证明自己高人一等
on the base of some external factor
换言之
In other words
我本身不够好
I'm not good enough as I am
证明不了我有多好
You know, to prove how good I am
我必须拿自己跟别人比较
I have to compare myself to another
我可以比较居住的地方
whether I choose you know, place of residence
比较成长教育
whether I choose upbringing
比较肤色
whether I choose the color of the skin
它的中心是相对能力感
It's about relative competence
但是独立的人
Whereas people who are independent
没有这种比较的需求 或者说这种需求没那么强烈
don't have the need or have less of that need for comparison
遵循他人的需求也没那么强烈
as well as less of that need to conform
他们坚持原则
They are true to principles
他们自己的原则
their own principles
但原则并不是万灵药
Now this is not a panacea
原则并不总是好的
This is not always good
因为纳粹分子
because I'm sure there are also Nazis
也很坚持自己的原则
who are true to their principles
但我等一下讲的研究
But as I'll show later in research
表明坚持原则的人更可能
those who are true to their principles are more likely
听从自己的心
to follow their heart
只要他们的心没有受伤
And unless their heart is damaged
我说的受伤不是一个比喻
I mean that in a true sense of the word, damaged
他们会追求做好事
they will seek to do good
他们会追求帮助他人
They will seek to help
他们的移情会增加
Their levels of empathy will increase
566
这是移情的矛盾
And this is the paradox of empathy
当我培养移情时
It's actually when we cultivate empathy
或者说当我们培养…
or rather when we cultivate
实在找不到更好的词
for lack of a better term
我也不想用一个新词
and I actually don't want to use a new term
当我们培养自爱时
When we cultivate self-love
当我们培养自尊时
when we cultivate self-esteem
我们就会更有可能变得
that's when we are most likely
富有同情心 爱别人
to be empathic and to love others
大家想想黄金原则
Look at the golden rule
要像爱自己一样爱你的邻居
love your neighbors as you love yourself
在这个原则里
What does that
爱你的邻居的先决条件是什么?
what is the prerequisite of loving your neighbor?
爱自己
The self
你就是标准
You are the standard
我们自己是我们评价他人的标准
we are the standard of how we evaluate others
因为我们怎么对待他们经常…
because our behavior toward others very often
不是通常
not always
但经常都反映了我们怎么对待自己
very often - mirrors our behavior toward ourselves
所以那些培养独立自我感的人
So people cultivating independent sense of self
那些有强烈自我认同的人 更能认同别人
who have a strong self identity are better able to identify with others
587
除了道德行为以外
In addition to moral behavior
还会有更好的认知表现
better cognitive performance - you see
有强烈依赖型自尊的人
people who have a strong dependent self-esteem
或者说行动主要由他人言论决定的人
or are primarily driven by what other people say
会遵循别人在遵循的规矩
will follow the rule that has already been taken
他们很可能变得就像一台机器一样
They will, can potentially be great mechanics
因为他们会为了得到赞扬而努力
because they'll work hard for these accolade
努力是好事
and that's a good thing, to work hard
但他们不会打破陈规
But they'll basically remain within the box
而有强烈独立型自尊的人
whereas the people who have a stronger sense of independent self-esteem
就会打破陈规
think outside the box
选择别人没有走过的道路
choose the path that hasn't already been taken
但这并不代表他们不会选择
That doesn't mean that they can't walk in the pat
00:31:54,000 --&gt; 00:31:54,900
别人已经走过的路
that has been taken
只是这是他们真正
if that is what they really
真正想要的生活就行了
really want to do with their lives
所以如果我们说"别人说走东 我偏偏走西"
So you know it's just as much sign of dependence when we say
这同样也是依赖型的
"Wel,I am gonna do the opposite of what everyone else does."
因为我的行为还是取决于他人
because I'm still dependent on what everyone else does
所以这不是独立型自尊
So that's not independent self-esteem
而是依赖型自尊
That's just more dependence
如果我坐下说
But if I sit down and I say
"好的 我该怎么过我的人生?"
"Ok, what do I really, really want to do with my life?"
我很认真地想
And I think about it truly
把自己置身于一个没人知道我在做什么的世界
Put myself in a world that no one would know what I was doing
我会更可能找到我的爱好
I'm much more likely to identify that thing which is my passion
我的核心 我的使命 也许是在投资银行工作
my core, my calling - be it in investment banking
也许是在UniLu工作
or work in the UniLu
这并不重要
It doesn't matter
问题是"我的动力是什么?"
The question is "What is the source of that"
有独立型自尊的人活到老学到老
Person with independent self-esteem is committed to continuous learning
回忆一下John Carlton的研究 在哈佛商学院的毕业生中
Remember the John Carlton's study – what differentiated the HBS grads
优等生与别的学生之间的区别就是
the extraordinary ones from the rest
他们总是问问题
was that, they were always asking questions
他们总是想学更多
They always wanted to learn more
他们不会
They didn't get out of – you know
从大学或商学院毕业后
graduate from college or graduate from business school
或者读完博士
or from a PHD program
诸如此类的学位后 说
or wherever it is, and say
"我懂得够多了"
"OK,I know enough"
"现在我是经理了 现在我是领导了
Or "Now I'm a manager; now I'm the leader
我会告诉人们应该做什么"
I'll tell people how they should…
这是Warren Bennis的一个优点
This is the amazing thing about Warren Bennis
他总是问问题
He's always asking questions
他对别人做的事感兴趣
He's always interested in what people are doing
他总是在学习
He's always learning
我等一下会给大家看一个研究
Happiness, levels of happiness are higher
当我们有独立型自尊时
and I'll show you the research in a minute
我们的幸福感会更高
when we experience a sense of independent self-esteem
我们会更平静 我们不会不停地
We are much calmer when we don't constantly
向别人证明自己
have to prove ourselves to others
总是处于警惕状态是一件很劳心劳力的事
It is enervating to constantly be on the guard
这个人会喜欢我吗? 我怎么得到他们的认同?
Is this person gonna like me? How do I gain their validation?
当我们这样想时 我们会更平静:
We are much calmer when we say
"让我表达自己
"Let me express myself
没错 我也许会受伤害
And yes it may hurt me
如果他们不喜欢我 我会伤心
It will hurt me, if they don't like me
没问题 我承受得住
That's OK. I'm resilient
我很坚强 我可以接受"
I'm strong, I can deal."
存在感更平静了
Much calmer - sense of being
当我们表达自己 而不是时刻想着表现自己
when we express rather than constantly try to impress
想象一下我们的生活会变得多轻松
Imagine how much lighter our lives can be
如果 当我们在教室时
if, when we are here
或者当我们走出教室时
or when we walk out of here
我们感受到这种存在感
we experience the sense of being
越来越多地…
more and more of the time
重申一次 不是完全地
again, not perfectly
因为这有违人的天性
because that's not human
但我们可以越来越多地单纯地存在
but more and more of the time to just be, to exist
感激我们的存在 作为一个整体存在
to celebrate our existence and the existence as a whole
我给大家讲几个研究
Let me share with you just some of the research
这样的研究不是很多
There hasn't been a lot
00:34:44,300 --&gt; 00:34:50,200
我想给大家讲我做的一些研究
And I wanna share with you just some of the work that I did for
是我读博士学位时做的 后来还继续做了一点
as part of my PHD and a little bit beyond
第一个研究是关于
The first research that was really able to deal with
自尊的矛盾
the paradox of self-esteem
也就是说 有些人得到很多赞扬
of how some people get so much accolade
但他们的自尊下降了
and yet their self-esteem decreases
而那些有很高自尊的人 有些有敌对情绪
or how some people have high self-esteem or hostile
但有些却对别人宽厚仁慈
versus others that are generous and benevolent
第一个研究是Kernis做的
The first research that was done was by Kernis
他在1995年提出自尊稳定性这个概念
who back in 1995 came up with the concept of self-esteem stability
他说 真正能够预测
And he said what actually can predict
一个人究竟是敌对还是宽厚
whether a person will be hostile or generous
他们的自尊会随着时间增高
whether their self-esteem over time will be high
还是降低的 不是自尊本身
or whether it will lower over time is not a self-esteem per se
而是自尊的稳定性
but rather is the stability of their self-esteem
他发现…他追踪实验对象
And what he showed - he followed people
例如 一两周
you know, for example, for a week or two weeks
他会测评他们的状态自尊而不是特质自尊
and he would measure their state rather than trait
他们当时的状态自尊
their state self-esteem at the time
有些人…
So there were certain people who
假设这里是自尊水平
if this is the self-esteem level
这里是时间
and this is time
在某个时候 有些人的自尊在这里
There were people whose self-esteem at this point
然后第二天
was here and then the next day
在这里 然后这里
here, and then here
然后又回到这里 这里
and then here again, and then here
这里…
and here and here
假设他测了十次
and he measured, let's sa, ten times
他想测出
And what he wanted to see
这些数据分布的标准偏差
to measure - the standard deviation of the spread
它有多接近? 有多稳定?
How close was it? How stable was it?
假设这个人
So this would be someone with
平均来说
maybe on average
有很高的自尊
high self-esteem
但有很多起伏
but with a lot of fluctuations
有些人则像这样
Other people were more like this
也有起起伏伏
Again, ups and downs
有时是很大的起伏
but sometimes large fluctuations
但总体来说
but overall
很稳定
pretty stable
同样水平的自尊
Same level of self-esteem
特质自尊
trait self-esteem
但状态自尊的起伏少了很多
but state self-esteem fluctuated far less
他发现 是自尊的稳定性
And what he showed was that it was the stability
而不是自尊本身 决定了
rather than self-esteem per se that determined
一个人是敌对还是仁慈
whether or not a person would be hostile or benevolent
自尊不稳定的人
People with unstable self-esteem
更可能充满敌对情绪
were more likely to be hostile
而自尊更稳定的人
People with more stable self-esteem
更可能宽厚仁慈
were more likely to be generous and benevolent
这就解释了自尊理论的
resolving a lot of the contradictions
很多矛盾和误解
misunderstanding in the literature
当我看到这个理论时 我顿悟了
When I saw this, I had a eureka
亲身体验到的一次顿悟
personal eureka experience
我说
And I said
"就是它了 他找到答案了"
"This is it! He's onto something."
我在2000年写我的硕士论文时
And what I did in my master's thesis back in 
我设计了一个问卷
was created a questionnaire
一个很简单的问卷 测量依赖型自尊
a very simple questionnaire that measured dependent versus
和独立型自尊的对比
independent self-esteem
我测评学生
And I measured students
大部分是哈佛学生 我还在新加坡做了代表性抽样调查
mostly Harvard students - I did also cross sectional in Singapore
我那时经常在新加坡 得出同样的结果
I was spending a lot of time there at the time - similar results
亚洲和美国的一样
Asia and here
至少新加坡和美国的一样
at least in Singapore and in United States
我发现 依赖型自尊
And what I found was that dependent self-esteem
与不稳定性有关
was associated with instability
而独立型自尊与稳定性有关
independent self-esteem was associated with stability
换言之
In other words
我只测量了一次 而不是十次
I came up with one measure that instead measuring ten times
到底这种自尊会导致敌对情绪
whether that kind of self-esteem would lead to hostility
焦虑 还是平静或宽厚
anxiety, versus calmness or generosity
我只用了一个测量数据
I used just one measure
我发现
And that's what I found
依赖性自尊与自尊不稳定性
very high correlation between dependent self-esteem
高度相关
and self-esteem instability
两者成正比
positive correlation
而独立型自尊和自尊稳定性
and a positive correlation between independent self-esteem
也成正比
and self-esteem stability
738
当时我的一些学生也就此做了一些研究
Then some of my students at the time did research on it
例如 Mellisa Christino
For example, Mellisa Christino
你们会在这门课上
who you'll meet
看到她写的一些东西
at least some of her writing later on in this class
她本科时写的毕业论文
did her senior thesis as an undergrad here
就是表明独立型自尊和快乐
on showing the connection between independent self-esteem and happiness
独立型自尊与心流的关系
and independent self-esteem and flow
那些有高度独立型自尊的人
Those who had high independent self-esteem
最有可能在运动场上体验到心流
were most likely to experience flow on athletic field
因为这就是她的研究对象 哈佛运动员
which is where her research was - Harvard athletics
高度独立自尊的人也有更高的幸福感
also connected to higher levels of happiness
我的论文是想准确地找出
Then my dissertation was trying to pin down these exact characteristics
自尊理论存在的问题
that were problematic in self-esteem literature
我说过 高度自尊意味着自恋
Remember, high self-esteem means narcissism
怎么区分这两者?
How do you differentiate?
我在论文里发现
Well, what I found in the dissertation was that
自恋其实是与高度依赖型自尊有关
narcissism is connected actually to high dependent self-esteem
而自恋与独立型自尊没有什么关系
There was no correlation between independent self-esteem and narcissism
至于宽厚
When it comes to generosity
这也许是研究中最令人意外的结果
this was probably the most surprising result of the study
有独立型自尊的人
people with independent self-esteem
其实更宽厚仁兹
were actually more generous and benevolent
不仅自我报告如此 对他人的行为也是如此
both in terms of self report and in terms of their actual behavior
非常强烈的自我感
toward other people - a strong sense of self
我说过 像爱自己一样爱你的邻居
Remember, love your neighbor as you love yourself
己所不欲 勿施于人
Do not do unto others which you would not have done to yourself
当你对自我有一个高标准时
And when you have a high standard for the self
对他人也会有一个高标准
there is a high standard for the other
通常这是无意识地发生的
And that usually happens automatically
因为我们怎么对待他人就会怎么对待自己
because we mirror our behavior toward the "I"
还有敌对情绪
And then hostility
敌对情绪与自尊本身没有关系
no correlation between hostility and self-esteem per se
因为有些
because some people have
有高度自尊的人 有很高的敌对情绪
with high self-esteem, have high levels of hostility
但有些有高度自尊的人 敌对情绪很低
some people with high self-esteem have low levels of hostility
而且更宽厚仁慈
and more generosity
但依赖型和独立型自尊能预测敌对情绪
But dependent and independent self-esteem predicted hostility
那些有高度自尊的人 而且自尊主要是依赖型的
Those with high self-esteem that was mostly dependent
这样的人更可能…但也有例外 不是所有人都会这样
were more likely, not always, not every person
但平均来说 这样的人更可能表现出敌对
but on average, were more likely to display hostility
而那些有高度自尊 而且主要是独立型自尊的人
those people with high self-esteem that is mostly independent
会更坦率 合作 宽厚
were much more open, cooperative and generous
完美主义 那时我有两个学生
Perfectionism - two of my students at that time
Tiffany Ignaczyk和Kate Richey
Tiffany Ignaczyk and Kate Richey
她是这个班的助教
who is a TF in this class
做了一个很优秀的研究 表明完美主义
did fantastic work showing the connection between perfectionism
和自尊的关系 有高度独立型自尊的人
and self-esteem - how people with high independent self-esteem
他们是完美主义者的可能性更低
were less likely to be perfectionistic
为什么? 独立型自尊的人更注重表达自己
Why? Because it is about self expression
注重学习和成长
it's about constantly learning and growing
而学习和成长
And part of learning and growing
就必定要跌倒再爬起
is falling down and getting up again
学习只有这个途径
no other way to learn
而依赖型自尊更注重…
Whereas dependent self-esteem were more concerned
我上节课引用Mihnea Moldoveanu说的话
the words of Mihnea Moldoveanu that I quoted last time
我们声称自己想要真相
we say we want the truth
但其实我们只是想自己是正确的
what we mean is that we want to be correct
更依赖于他人的看法
more dependent on how they perceived
更完美主义 更害怕失败
more perfectionistic, more afraid of failure
这同样适用于…我们之前讲过
So this applies also - and we talked about before
但我想再说一次 适用于恋爱
but I just want to point it out again - to relationships
这也是David Schnarch
That's work on the topic
就这个课题所做的研究 我们说过
David Schnarch again where we talked about
我们怎么达到被了解的阶段
how do we get to the stage of being known
而不是被认可的阶段
rather than being validated
这并不代表在七八十岁时
And that doesn't mean that at the age of 70 or 
当我们完全进化了
when we are fully evolved
我们并不喜欢 或者不需要我们伴侣的认可
we don't enjoy or need at times the validation of our partner
我们需要
We do
但同时
But at the same time
我们更关心的是表达自我
we are much more about self expression
David Schnarch是这样说的
Here is what David Schnarch has to say
"分化是你维持自我感的能力
"Differentiation is your ability to maintain your sense of self
当你情绪上和/或身体上
when you are emotionally and/or physically
与别人亲近
close to others
尤其是这些人变得对你越来越重要时
especially as they become increasingly important to you
分化使你维持自己的道路
Differentiation permits you to maintain your own course
当爱人 朋友
when lovers, friends
家庭向你施压 让你同意和遵从时
and family pressure you to agree and conform
分化良好的人能够同意 但又不会觉得
Well-differentiated people can agree without feeling
他们"失去自我"
like they're 'losing themselvs'
能够不同意 但又不会觉得被排挤和难受"
and can disagree without feeling alienated and embittered."
这正是被了解的含义
This is what being known is all about
做你自己 分化出来
being yourself, being differentiated
这就是独立型自尊的核心
This is what independent self-esteem is
这是最高境界的相互依存的
this is what ultimately interdependence
真谛
is all about
825
说来容易做来难
easier said than done
但用它来启发我们是非常有用的
But again it's very helpful to have that as a heuristic
在我们潜意识里
the back of your mind
当它发生时 能够注意到
to notice that it's happening
因为在20岁这个年龄
Because at the age of 
你们也会经历相互依存的时刻
you are also experiencing moments of interdependence
与朋友家人产生真正的联系
real connection with a friend, family
走在后院里 欣赏美景
just walking in the yard and admiring the beauty of it all
这些珍贵的时刻 随着时间过去
and  these are precious moments that over time
我们会有越来越多
we can have more and more of
只要我们跟从这条自然的道路
if we follow the natural path
自然的发展
the natural evolution
继续用回走路那个比喻
Going back to the analogy of walking
我经常…我们知道
I'm very often when - we know these you know
历史上有很多故事
stories through history
有些人被迫穿上
people were put in you know shoes
太小的鞋子 或者被剥夺走路的自由
that were too small for them or were not allowed to try and walk
Ceausescu统治下的罗马尼亚就是这样
such as very often the case was in Romanian under Ceausescu
人们无法自然发展
where people were not allowed to develop naturally
当我们的自然发展被阻碍了
when our natural development is hindered
这是有可能的
and it can be hindered
我们就不能如我们所能的那样发展
we don't evolve as we can
所以在心理层面上也有这个问题
So the question is also on the psychological level
我们怎样才能如我们所能地发展? 你们在这个学期
how can we evolve as we can? And some of the tools
所学到的一些方法
that you learned throughout the semester
不管是认知的学习方法
whether it is the cognitive tool of learning
允许自己有人的天性
the permission to be human
还是你们具体地运用的方法
or the tools that you can actually apply
例如写日记
such as keeping a journal
做运动
such as exercising
学会感恩
such as doing the gratitude exercise
冥想 练瑜伽
such as meditating, or doing yoga
这些方法都是
All these things as you'll see are ways
有助实现自我的方法
of becoming more self-actualized
它们能加速这个过程
of expediting the process
当我们加速这个过程
And when we expedite the process
就意味着此时此刻我们就能越来越多地
it means that right now right here we are able to experience
体验到那种存在感
that sense of being much more often
我们不用等到50 60或70岁
we don't need to wait until we are 50 or 60 or 
我们可以早早地就踏上那条健康的道路
We can on that healthy journey way before that
那么我们该怎么做?
So how do we do it? How do we do it?
我们说回
Let me go back to the model
我们讲改变时讲过的那个模型
we talked about when we discussed change
我们讲过改变的ABC
And we talked about the ABC of change
A是情感 B是行为 C是认知
Affect. Behavior, and Cognition
我说过改变的最重要方法
And I mentioned that the most important approach to change
改变的最有效方法是B 行为
the most effective approach to change is the B, the Behavior
我用一个模型讲过态度如何改变行为
And I introduced this model of how attitudes change behavior
反过来行为如何改变态度
and in turn how behavior changes attitudes
大家回忆一下自我知觉理论
Remember self-perception theory
如果你想在某个生活领域得到改善
if you want to improve in one area in our lives
最好的方法就是让自己的行为变得像改善了一样
the best thing to do is to behave as we would
如果我想要高度自尊
If I want high self-esteem
我的行为就要像一个有高度自尊的人
I need to behave like a person with high self-esteem behaves
为什么? 因为自尊就是一种态度
Why? Because self-esteem is simply an attitude
是我对自我的态度
it's the attitude I have toward the self
是我对自己的评价
it's the I evaluating the me
要提高这种态度
And to enhance that attitude
我就要…或者说最有效的办法
I need to engage - or the most effective way
不是唯一的办法
not the only way
最有效的办法 就是表现出一个
but the most effective way is to engage in behavior of a person
有高度自尊的人的行为
with high self-esteem
所以榜样的作用很重要
which is why it's so important to have role models
我说的榜样不止一个
And I'm saying that in plural
有榜样很重要
It's important to have role models
我们可以学习这些人
people we can look up to
说
and say
"我想有这样的性格…
"I want to have that chara...
不 我想有Warren Bennis那样的
No. I want to have the calm and the acceptance
平静 包容和慷慨精神
and the generosity of spirit that Warren Bennis has
我想有Marva Collins身上的
I want to have the passion
那种对教学的热爱
for teaching that Marva Collins displays
把榜样的所有优点综合起来
integrate that aggregates of role models
这样我们就能有他们那样的行为 并且慢慢地培养
so that we can behave and over time achieve that attitude
我们追求的那种态度
that we are looking for
我来讲一下提高自尊的几个方法
So let me go over a few of them of how to enhance self-esteem
大部分都已经讲过了
We've discussed most
所以这也算是很好地总结一下我们讲过的内容
so this is a good summary of some of the things that we went through
首先有高度独立型自尊的人通常…
First, people with high independent self-esteem generally
正如我们之前从研究中看到的那样
as we saw before from the research
包括Melissa Christino和其他人的研究
Melissa Christino's research and others'
他们通常更平静
are generally calmer
所以独立型自尊是一种态度
So independent self-esteem is the attitude
平静是一种行为
calm is the behavior
也就是说 行为平静的人
which also means that people who behave calmly
他们的独立型自尊会随着时间增加
will increase over time their independent self-esteem
我们在和冥想相关的研究中看过 例如
And we see that in related research on meditation for example
正念冥想
on mindfulness
当我们越来越多地练习这种方法
as we induce more of it
我们的自尊
our self-esteem
我们独立型的自尊
and it is the independent part of self-esteem
因为它不需要赞扬
because they are not about accolades
"我今天冥想得真好
"Oh I meditated so well today
大家给我鼓掌"
Everyone, clap."
这不是这种自尊的重点
It's not about that
它的重点是带来平静
It's about inducing calm
关注自己 活出自己
being centered, being myself
又例如运动
Or physical exercise
运动能带来平静
physical exercise induces calm
因为它在体内释放某种酶
because it releases certain enzyme
某些化学物质 这样随着时间过去
certain chemicals in the body so that over time
它能直接增强我们的独立型自尊
it actually strengthens our independent self-esteem indirectly
因为行为
because behavior
体验了平静 导致态度的转变
experiencing the calm leads to a changing attitude
假设你中了一个无名咒语
Imagine that a spell of anonymity has been cast on you
从现在起在你的余生里
From now on and for the rest of your life
没有人会知道你做什么
no one will know what you are doing
除了你自己 没有人知道你有多好
no one but you will know how good you are
你有多宽厚
how generous you are
你有多仁慈
how benevolent you are
除了你自己 没有人知道你有多富有多强大
No one but you will know how wealthy and powerful
你有多重要
and important you are
只有你自己知道你的成就
You and you alone will know about all your accomplishments
只有你知道你有多好的操守
you and you alone will know about how ethical
道德和性格
moral and wonderful you are
在这样的一个世界里 你中了无名咒语
In such a world where a spell of anonymity has been cast on you
你会怎么做？
what would you do?
有谁觉得很熟悉吗? 你们会怎么做?
Familiar, anyone? What would you do?
正如我在课后作业里提过那样
Now as I mentioned in the response paper
这并不代表我们在匿名世界里怎么生活
this does not mean that this is what I need to do
在现实世界里就应该怎么生活
with my life - what I would do in this anonymous world
这个方法的意义是 在这样一个世界里
What it is saying though is in such world
或者说做这样的练习
or doing this exercise
它能磨练我们
it can help us hone in
在抛开赞扬和声望的情况下
on what we would do regardless of the accolades
我们会怎么做
and praise and prestige
我经常练习这个方法 大家知道
I do this exercise regularly - as you know
在这个班上 我介绍给大家的方法 我都一一练过
no exercise in this class that I assign to you is foreign to me
我都练过
I do them all
我也像大家一样边上课边学习
I'm going through this class just as you are
我会经常用这个方法
And I do this class, this regularly
例如 我在这里读研究生的时候
And for example, when I did it as a graduate student here
我当时的答案是在那样的一个世界里
my response was that in such a world
我可能连博士学位都拿不到
I actually would not get a PHD
我不会拿到博士学位
I would not get a PHD
因为读博对我来说不是一件很愉快的事 虽然很有意义
because it wasn't that pleasurable to me - very meaningful
但没那么愉快
but less pleasurable to me
我读得不是很好
I wasn't that good at it
不觉得我自己有什么惊人能力
didn't feel like I was thriving
但我也跟自己说 在现实世界里
But I also said to myself that in our world
不是那个没人知道我在做什么的世界
not in that world where no one would know what I was doing
而是在一个别人知道我在做什么的世界
but in a world where people know what I'm doing
我需要一个博士学位才能在大学任教
I would need a PHD in order to teach at a university
所以我继续学习 最终拿到了我的博士学位
which is why I continued and eventually got my PHD
我是在毕业前不久做这个练习的
I did this exercise just before I graduated
我当时在考虑不同的出路
And I was thinking about different areas to pursue
我想 在一个没有人知道我在做什么的世界里
And I said, what would I do in such a world
我会做什么?
where no one would know what I was doing?
我的答案是教书
And the answer to that was I would teach
我的答案是我不会做研究
The answer to that was I would not do research
这是很肯定的
That was very clear
所以那时候我决定放弃争取终身任期
And that's when I decided to get out of the tenure track option
即使当时外界 那些关心我的人
even though there was a lot of pressure on me from the outside
给了我很大的压力
from people who cared about me
他们说"再写两三篇文章
And they said "Look, two or three articles
你就能拿到一个很好的职位 争取终身任期
and you'll get into a great place, and the tenure track
你能做到的 你的博士论文可以发表的"
You can do it. You know your PHD, can be published."
但我知道我不想过那样的生活
But I knew that wasn't the life that I wanted to lead
我要为此付出代价吗? 要
Is there a price for it? Yes
其中一个代价就是
I mean one of the price is that, you know
这是我在哈佛的倒数第二节课了
this is my second last class at Harvard
但我想要什么样的世界
But what kind of world
我想过什么样的生活
what kind of life did I want for myself
这个方法帮助我找到了
And that exercise helped me hone on that
你热爱什么? 你真正
What are your passions? What you really
想过的是怎么样的人生?
really want to do with your life?
你希望10年 20年后
Where do you see yourself 10 years from now
你会变成什么样?
or 20 years from now?
什么对你来说是非常重要的?
What's really important for you?
什么对你来说是重要的
What's important for you
就算没有别人的认同 点头 赞扬和欢呼
that you would do regardless of other people's approval
反对或批评
nods, accolades or cheering
你也会做的?
or disapproval, or criticism?
你在这样一个世界里会做什么?
What would you do in such a world?
这是一个很重要的问题
It's an important question to ask
那些…
People who experience
有高度独立型自尊的人会追求他们的兴趣
who have high independent self-esteem pursue their passions
那些追求他们兴趣的人会有更高的自尊
people who pursue their passions enjoy higher levels of self-esteem
那些有很多心流的人
People who enjoy a lot of flow
他们的独立型自尊也会增加
their independent self-esteem will increase as well
问问你自己 "你什么情况下体验过心流?
Ask yourself: where do you experience flow?
你什么时候忘我过? 是你读书的时候吗?
Where do you lose yourself? Is it when you read?
是坐在
Is it over dinner
你队友旁边吃晚餐时吗?
when you are sitting next to your block mates?
是你写作时吗?
Is it when you write?
是你站在全班同学前面
Is it when you are standing in front of a class
介绍一个课后活动时吗?
speak in an after school program?
你什么时候体验过?
When do you experience it?
你以前什么时候感受过心流? 问问你自己
When did you experience it in the past? Ask yourself
因为它最能预测到你未来什么情况下会有心流
Because that very often is the best predictor of future flow
你想过什么样的人生?
What kind of life do you want to lead?
你真正想做的是什么?
What do you really, really want to do?
有高度独立型自尊的人会付诸行动
People with high independent self-esteem put themselves on the line
他们会应对 不停地加强自己
They cope, they stretch themselves constantly
因为他们总是想学习成长
Because they are always about learning and growing
进步 发挥更大的作用
improving making more of difference
触及更多的人
touching more people
那些应对的人…
And people who cope
大家回忆一下 自我知觉理论
remember, self perception theory
那些应对的人 随着时间过去
people who cope over time
会获得更高的独立型自尊
will enjoy higher levels of independent self-esteem
即使他们这样做的时候跌倒过
Even if they fall while doing it
即使失败了四次
even if she says no four times
他们会重新站起来 变得更强大
they get up again and they get stronger
他们的独立型自尊会随着时间增强
And their independent self-esteem strengthens over time
那个图并不是这样子的
The graph doesn't look just like this
起起伏伏 有高有低
the ups and downs with spikes
真正的图是有起有伏
It looks with same ups and downs
但健康 快乐和自尊的走势
but with an upward trajectory of well being
是呈上升趋势的
happiness and self-esteem
谦虚 真诚的谦虚
Humble behavior - genuine humble behavior
我最喜欢的一本书
One of my favorite texts
也是我的文化里最重要的一本书之一
and I think one of the most important texts in my tradition
Pirkei Avos 《先贤箴言》
Pirkei Avos, the Chapter of the Fathers
里面有一句话
There's a sentence there
一句谚语 我读了一遍又一遍
a proverb  that I've been reading over and over and over again
但一直都参透不了
and never could understand
直到我听到一个著名的拉比
until I heard an interpretation of a well-known Rabbi
拉比Mitchell Wohlberg 他对句话的解释
Rabbi Mitchell Wohlberg about this interpretation
这句话是这样说的
And here is the sentence
我翻译过来:那些追逐荣誉的人
I'm translating: those who chase after honor
荣誉会躲避他们
honor will run away from them
那些躲避荣誉的人
those who run away from honor
荣誉会追逐他们
honor will chase them
再说一次:那些追…
Let me repeat: those who run after
追逐荣誉的人
who chase honor
荣誉会躲避他们
honor will run away from them
那些躲避荣誉的人
those who run away from honor
荣誉会追逐他们
honor will chase them
我一直都参透不了 直到我听到拉比Wohlberg
And it didn't make sense to me until I put it in the context
关于自尊的一场演讲 并把它跟这句话结合起来理解
the result of the lecture by Rabbi Wohlberg of self eteem
荣誉的本质是尊敬自己
Honor is essentially honoring the self
相信自己
believing in one self
如果我不停地追逐荣誉
And if I'm constantly about chasing honor
追逐下一个赞扬 下一个奖
the next accolade, the next prize
下一个认同 下一个认可
the next approval, the next validation
荣誉就会躲避我
then honor will run away from me
下一次我就要在更陡的山坡上
And then I'll have to push that stone up steeper
把石头推上去
incline the next time
我继续追逐荣誉 等我到达了山顶
And I continue to chase that honor and I get there
石头又会滚下来
and then the rock rolls back down again
科林斯王就要继续推石头 而山坡变得
And Sisyphus continues on and on with the steep becoming...
越来越陡峭
with the incline becoming steeper
相反 如果我躲避荣誉 言行谦虚
Whereas if I run away from honor - behave humbly
随着时间过去 真正的荣誉
over time honor, true honor
打心底发出的荣誉感就会追逐我
internally generated honor will chase me
行为可以改变态度
Behavior can change attitude
这需要时间
It takes time
重申 一开始
And again at the beginning
正如我之前说过
as I mentioned to you before
我想变得谦虚 我想大家都知道
I wanted to be modest and I wanted everyone to know
我有多谦虚
how modest I was and how humble I was
我明白
And I understood that well
那不是真诚的谦虚
that's not genuine
但我仍然可以保持谦虚的言行
but I can still behave and act in a humble way
随着时间过去
And over time
它就会慢慢地融入我们
it becomes more and more part of who we are
行为不会一夜之间就改变态度
Behavior changing attitude doesn't happen overnight
但这并不意味着一个80岁
And again it doesn't mean that a person at 
完成进化 实现自我的人 不会追寻荣誉
who is evolved and actualized does not look for honor at all
当他们被赞扬时 不会觉得高兴
does not feel good when he or she is praised
那是很自然的 是人的天性
That's natural - part of who we are
以下这个知识点很重要
This is an important one
我们在班上经常讲简化生活
We've talked about it a lot in the class about simplifying
那…
The...
我经常想 为什么在一个
I've often wondered the why is it that in a county
像美国这样的国家里
like the United States
一个追崇个人主义 自为更生的国家
such an individualistic country - self-reliance
大家在高中时读了爱默生
most of you read it in high school by Emerson
那么多关于个人主义和自我的书
so much about individualism and the self
为什么你们还是那么随波逐流?
why is it that there's such high levels of conformity?
为什么有那么多人还是走
Why is it that so many people go on the path
以前很多人已经走过的路?
that has been already taken and prescribed by others?
这并不意味着走这条路的人都是随波逐流的
That doesn't mean that everyone who goes on the path conforms
再一次 你可能很循规蹈矩
Again, you can be highly conforming
选择做一个顾问或者在流浪者之家
choosing to work as a consultant or choosing to be a volunteer
做自愿者
at a homeless shelter
你可能是取决于他人的 也可能是取决于自我的
You can be equally other determined or equally self determined
重点不在于选哪条路
It's not about choosing a particular path
重点是为什么
But why did I
我们会看到这么多随波逐流的人?
why do we see so many people who conform?
我想这是因为他们的成长教育
And I think it's because of their right raise
我想是因为美国人
I think it's because people in the United States
或者普遍来说 西方世界
Western world in general
没有花足够的时间来反省
do not take enough time to reflect
思考这样的问题:
and to think about those questions such as
"我真正想过的人生是怎样的?"
"what do I reall, really want to do with my life?
问这样的问题:
to ask questions such as
"在一个没有人知道我在做什么的世界里
"what would I do in a world where no one would know
我会做什么?"
what I was doing?"
用三问法来问自己 意义
to go through the three question process - the meaning
"什么有意义?" "什么让我快乐?"
"what is meaningful?"; "what is pleasurable?"
"我喜欢什么?" "我擅长什么?"
"what do I enjoy?"; and "what am I good at?"
"我的强项是什么?"
"What are my strengths?"
问自己这些问题
To go through these questions and to ask
问这些重要的问题
those important questions
因为当我们退后一步 慢慢思考
because when we take a step back and take the time
这时我们才能变成自我
that's when we become ourselve
我们才能找到适合我们的道路
that's when we identify the path that is right for me
我想用一个阶段模型来给大家讲解
Let me illustrate this by showing you a stage model
这是以Daniel Gilbert的研究为基础的
And this is based on the work of Daniel Gilbert
与他的认知晕眩研究有间接关系
indirectly refers to it his work on cognitive dizziness
他和其他人的研究发现
And what he and others have shown is that
当人的认知忙乱时 当他们匆匆忙忙时
people behave very differently when they are cognitively busy
他们的行为会非常不同于
when they are in a hurry
当他们慢慢花时间
versus when they have time
专心思考一下他们所做的事时
they can focus on whatever it is that they are doing
也跟Tim Kasser的时间充裕研究有关
So also connected to Tim Kasser's work on time affluence
第一个段阶是我们没有时间的阶段
So the first stage is the stage where we don't have time
我们很赶时间 匆匆忙忙
we are in a hurry; we are rushed
我们的反应是无意识的
our reaction is automatic
在这个阶段 我们会随波逐流
This is the part where we conform
我们会遵从群体
This is time when we conform to the group
就像Asch做的实验那样
as in the Asch experiments
在这个阶段 当那个穿白袍的人
this is when we conform to the man with a white coat
00:59:57,800 --&gt; 01:00:00,
告诉我们实验必须继续时 我们会遵从
telling us the experiment must go on
我们会按下按钮 电击一个无辜的人
And we push the button and shock an innocent victim
在这个阶段我们会随波逐流地服从
This is where conformity to obedience
服从群体
conformity to a group is
当我们没有时间时
when we don't have time
当我们匆忙时
when we are busy
当我们不认真思考
when we don't really think about
我们想做什么 可以做什么时
what it is that we want to do and can do
这是依赖的自我 第一阶段
This is our dependent self - stage one
通常这时我们会到达第二阶段
We very often at this moment can reach stage two
不用等很久
don't need to wait a long time
这时 如果我们慢慢来
At this moment, if we take the time
因为如果我们慢慢来
because when we take the time
这时我们就开始有意识思考
that's when we engage in deliberate reflection
把思考与行为结合起来
combining reflection and action
这时候我们会想我们做的事
where we think about what we do
想我们想的事
we think about what we think
我们慢慢来
We take our time
这个阶段的自我是自主的
This is where the self is autonomous
这时候独立型自尊出现了
this is where the independent self-esteem emerges
当我们慢慢来时
when we have the time
我们随波逐流的可能性就会减低
That's where we are much less likely to conform
这时我们会培养
that's when we are cultivating
表达我们独立的核心自我
and expressing our independent core self
想想接下来的一个实验
Think of the, of the following experiment
01:01:10,600 --&gt; 01:01:12,900
今天做不了 很可惜
It cannot be done today unfortune... Well
其实也不可惜
I mean it's not unfortunate
今天做不了
but it cannot be done today
这个实验其实是重复Milgram的实验 但有一个改动
And that is to retry the Milgram experiment with one difference
大家想象一下 有些同学熟悉Milgram实验
Imagine this - some of you know the Milgram experiment
我们在班上已经讲过了
We've spoken about it here
你坐在椅子里 手放在按钮上
You are sitting on the chair with your hand on the buttons
或者在你面前有一个控制台
Or in front of you, you have the panel
你选择60伏电压
And you go up to sixty volts
那个学习者没有什么反应
And there's no real reaction from the other person, the learner
你上升到75伏
And you go up to 75 volts
增加了15伏
a 15 volt increment
你升高到120伏 那个被电击的人
And you get to 120 volts and the confederate
你觉得他真的被电击了
whom you think is really being shocked
他说"哎哟 很痛"
says "Ouch! That hurts"
你抬起头看那个穿白袍的人
And you go and you look up at the person with the white coat
他说"实验必须继续"
and he says to you "the experiment must go on"
你继续提高电压 那个人被电得尖叫
And you go up and up; and the person is screaming
告诉你他要心脏病发了
and telling you he has a heart condition
你抬头看实验人员
And you look up at the experimenter
他看起来就像那样
who looks like this
他告诉你…我之前一直没注意过他
And he tells you - I never noticed him until now
很高兴我从没注意过他
I'm glad I've never noticed him
他跟你说"实验必须继续"
He says to you "the experiment must go on"
你继续
And you go on
那些人开始大哭起来
And they start to whimper and say
"我有心脏病 快放我出去"
"I have a heart condition, Get me out of here!"
你抬头看
And you look up
实验人员说
And the experimenter says
"没有答案是错误的答案
"no answer is wrong answer
提高电压 实验必须继续
Raise the voltage. The experiment must go on."
这时63%的参与者会把电压提高到350伏
Now 63 percent of participants went above 350 volt
超过那个人所能承受的水平
which is beyond the level where the person was not even heard anymore
他们继续电击到 直到XXX点
They continue to shock them until the point of xxx
超过了危险水平
beyond the very dangerous
因为他告诉他们 实验必须继续
because he told them that the experiment must go on
现在想象一下 同样的实验 但有一个小小的改动
Now imagine the same experiment with a slight difference
你用75伏电压电他们 他们说
You give them 75 volts and they say
"哎哟 很痛"
"Ouch! That hurts"
然后实验人员告诉你
And then the experimenter tells you
"实验必须继续
"The experiment must go on
不如你先休息15分钟"
Why don't you come back in 15 minutes"
你出去15分钟
And you go out for 15 minutes
等你回来时
And you come back again
这时是90伏
And it's now at 
假设你提高到120伏
And you go up - let's say - you go up to 
120伏 那个人在尖叫
And 120, the person is screaming
"放我出去 你们没权把我关在这里"
"Get me out of here! You have no right to keep me here!"
你抬头看实验人员 他告诉你
And you look up at the experimenter and the experimenter says
"实验必须继续
"The experiment must go on
不如你先休息15分钟?"
But why don't you take a 15 minute break?"
你们认为这时会怎么样
What do you think would happen
如果这些人电击人之前有15分钟的时间休息?
if people were given 15 minute breaks between shocks?
你认为会有63%的人会把电压提高到超过危险水平吗?
Do you think 63 percent would go to extremely dangerous and beyond?
很可能不会 因为在这15分钟里
Probably not, because during these 15 minutes
我们不再处于热态
we are no longer in a hot state
而是处于冷态
but rather in a cold state
这是引用George Loewenstein的话
the words of George Loewenstein
当他们处于冷态时 他们会想
When they are in a cold state, they'll think
"我疯了吗? 我在这里干什么?"
"Am I out of my mind? What am I doing here?"
他们会去打电话报警
And they will go and call the police
而不是15分钟后再走进去
as opposed to going back 15 minutes later and
"好的 现在我愿意杀了他们"
"Ok, now I'm willing to kill them"
因为他们在这个实验里就是以为自己杀了这些人
which is essentially what they presumably did in that experiment
如果他们没有那15分钟
But when they didn't have those 15 minutes
而是"实验必须继续"
when it was "the experiment must go on"
"实验必须继续"
"the experiment must go on"
他们就会继续
it went on
他们会为失去自我付出代价
And they paid a price of losing themselves
我们的现代生活也是这样
And this is what happens to us in modern life
当然后果没有Milgram的实验
not with such dire consequences
那么可怕
potentially could have been with Milgram
而且在现代 即使我们服从权威
and we are not doing immoral things
我们也没做什么不道德的事
as the cases with obedience to authority
但通常我们会伤害到自己
But we are hurting ourselves very often
因为我们随波逐流 遵从主流
because we are running around and we are conforming
我们做别人认为我们该做的事
and we are doing what they think we should do
我们做那把声音叫我们做的事
we are doing what that voice or voices are telling us to do
我们没有做自己想做的事
We are not doing what we are meant to be doing
你们知道我认为这门课最重要的部分是什么吗?
You know what I think the most important part of this class?
是课堂和课后作业
Its sections and response papers
我这么说不是因为谦虚
This is not out of modesty
没错 我想你们觉得我谦虚
yes, I want you to think that I'm modest
但这不是我
but that's not why I'm
这么说的原因
why I'm saying it
而是因为这时候你们有时间思考
It's because that is when you get the time to reflect
和你们的助教讨论
to talk about it with your teaching fellows
和你们的同学讨论
with your fellow students
思考
to think about it
你们被迫用额外时间来思考
You are "forced" to take a timeout
这时你们坐下写课后作业
It's when you sit down and write those response papers
回答我提出的问题
about these questions that I mentioned
这时你们真正的独立自我浮现了
it's when your real autonomous shining self comes ou
这时你跟朋友谈这门课
it's when you talk to your friends about this class
或者在食堂跟队友分享
or your block mates in the dining hall
这时你有时间和你的父母分享
when you take the time to share with your parents
这是独立自我就出现了
That's when it is happening
最后 正直
Finally, integrity
Nathaniel Branden
Nathaniel Branden
Nathaniel Branden和他的很多病人这样做过 他是心理治疗师
Nathaniel Branden did this with many of his clients - he's a therapist
他叫病人来 告诉他们
where he would bring them in and tell them
"好的 下周 暂停
"Ok, for the next week, stop
不能说谎 要完全诚实坦白"
No lies, Be fully integrated; be fully honest"
他发现这个方法 尤其是对于那些
And what he found was when he applies to especially people
会撒一点谎的病人来说
who would lie a little bit more
能够提高他们的自尊
that enhanced their self esteem
我记得在1996年 96或97年
I remember back in 1996 - I think it was 96 or 
克林顿弹劾案正在审判
when the whole Clinton impeachment trial was going on
CNN请来DePaulo
On CNN they brought on DePaulo
她是维珍尼亚大学的一位教授
she is a professor at University of Virginia
她专门研究说谎
and she does research on lying
他们采访了她 那是第一次
And they interviewed her and it was the first time
我接触到她的研究
that I was exposed to her work
她在CNN上说她的研究发现
And she said on CNN that her research shows that
基本上所有人都说谎 很多时候都是一些小谎
basically everyone lies - many times little lies
为了让别人觉得自己很厉害
intended to impress others
很多时候是大谎
many times, bigger lies
她发现
And what she found was that
人平均每天说三个谎
people lie in average 3 times a day
当我听到的时候
And when I heard it
我轻笑了一声
I scoffed, I said
"也许其他人每天说三次谎
"Wel, maybe other people lie three times a day
但我不说谎"
I don't lie"
我解释一下为什么说我不撒谎
And let me explain to you why I don't lie
这是真的
And this is true
因为我读大学时写的毕业论文
Because I wrote my senior thesis in college
就是说诚实是会带来好处的
on the concept of honesty pays
我当时既学心理也学哲学
I was a joint philosophy and psychology concentrator
我对道德 自尊 动机感兴趣
was interested in ethics, self esteem, motivation
我根据研究
And what I showed based on research
根据亚里士多德 亚当·史密斯的哲学著作
based on philosophical works by Aristotle, by Adam Smith
发现每次我们说谎 欺骗 不诚实时
that we pay a high psychological and emotional price whenever we lie
要付出巨大的
whenever we cheat
心理和情绪代价
whenever we are dishonest
所以我跟自己说
And then I said to myself
"让我试试DePaulo的方法"
"But let me try DePaulo's exercise."
她的方法就是叫人讲完一段对话后
What she does is have people evaluate their conversations
马上评估有哪些是真的 有哪些是说谎的
for honest or dishonest content right after it finishes
趁他们还清楚记得
so when it's still fresh in their mind
自己说过什么
what they talked about
他们会写一本日记
So they keep a journal
完全匿名的
which is completely anonymous
所以我想
So I said
"我会写 虽然我不说谎"
"But I'm gonna do , even though I don't lie"
因为我知道说谎的后果
because I know the consequences of lying
因为我的论文就是写这个的
because I wrote my thesis on it
我是诚实这个课题的专家
I'm an expert on honesty
我说我会写日记的
I said I'll still do it
因为我想实验一下
Cause I like to try experiments
就在我写日记的期间
As it happens
有一天晚上我出去约会
I went on a date that night
一个我没见过的人 不是Arianna
someone whom I never met before - was not Arianna
是我妈妈给我介绍的
someone that was whom my mom set me up with
我妈和她妈说我们在同一间学校
My mom and her mom talked together in the same school
然后我听说了她的一些很棒的事迹
And I heard wonderful things about her
我很激动
I was very excited
我们见了面以后就更加激动了
and became even more excited when we met
我们坐下来 吃饭聊天 很愉快
And we were sitting down and having a lovely dinner and talking
她是一个经济学家
And she is an economist
非常成功的经济学家
very successful economist
她问我是做什么的
And she asked me what I was doing
我告诉她我是心理学家
and I told her that I was a psychologist
我用我全部的心理知识在她面前表现自己
And I was really impressing her with all my knowledge of psychology
她说"我也对心理学感兴趣"
And she said:"You know I'm also interested in psychology."
我说"这一定会很顺利"
And I said:"This is going really well"
我自己心里说的 不是跟她说
To myself, not to her
我学到了教训 刚开始约会时不要说这样的话
I learned not to say those things on earlier dates
我们坐下来…
So we were sitting down and - you know
要学会失败
learn to fail
我们坐下来聊天
So we were sitting down and talking
然后她说
Then she said
"我刚读到一个心理学家的著作"
"Oh, you know,I just read about the psychologist"
她说了这个人的名字
And she said the name
非常著名的一个心理学家
you know, it's a very famous psychologis
"你听说过他吧?"
"You know him,right?"
我完全不知道
Now I didn't have the faintest clue who was she
她说的是谁 完全不知道
who she was talking about - no idea
我记得我呆了一下
And I remember pausing for a second
微笑地看着她
and looking at her and just smiling
"嗯嗯"
"Hmm, mHmmm"
然后我们继续聊
And the conversation continued to flow
我没有注意到自己说谎了
Now I would not have noticed this
但后来我回到家
except for the fact that afterwards I went home
回想这次的对话
and went over the conversation
我说"慢着 我刚才跟她说谎了"
Then I said "Hey wait a minut, I just lied to her!"
从那时起
And ever since then
我就经常这么做 我指的是说谎
I've been doing this regularly - lying that is
不 我经常这么做
No, I've been doing this regularly
从那时起
Ever since then
我就坚持磨练自己的正直
I've been keeping doing the integrity exercise
用DePaulo说的方法
that DePaulo talks about
用Nathaniel Branden说的方法
that Nathaniel Branden talks about
非常留意我说的话
to be very conscious about my conversations
我这么说是为了表现自己
Am I just saying things to impress
而说的假话吗?
which are not authentic?
我是不是说了小谎?
Am I having those little lies?
因为你们要明白 当我们说实话时
Because you see, when we are telling the truth
我们给自己传达了一个信息
the message that we communicate to ourselves
我们给自己传达的信息是
the message that we communicate to ourselves
我的话是有价值的
is that my words are worthy
我的话很重要 我很重要
my words are important; I matter
当我们不说实话时
And when we don't do that
当我们说谎时
when we tell lies
或者我们想不停地表现自己时
or we are about impressing constantly
我们是在说"这样的我不够好"
we are saying "I'm not good enough as I am."
我需要成为另一个人 让别人来喜欢我
I need to be someone else so that the other person likes
我需要知道这个心理学家
I need to know that psychologist
不然她就不会喜欢我
because otherwise she won't like me
而不是做真实的自己
instead of being authentic and real
1374
选择被认同而不是被了解
instead of being known rather than validated
用这个方法坚持一周
and doing it and being conscious of it for a week  at a time
直到行为改变了我们的态度
until the behavior changes our attitude
我开始更重视我的话
and I begin to value my words much more
当我跟自己传达 我是谁
when I communicate myself - who I am
而不是想着让别人觉得自己很厉害时
rather than trying to impress others
当我肯定自己时
When I assert myself
当我时不时地说"不"时
when I say no at times
这样我就能简化我的生活
so that I can simplify my life a little bit
当我该说是的时候说是
when I say yes when it's appropriate
即使这个"是"不是很受欢迎
even it's not the most popular yes in the world
但我应该这样说
but it's right for me
还要从时间和空间上把这个方法扩展开来
And it's about expanding it in time as well as in space
首先从我自己开始
It is started first of all by myself
为什么写日记这么有用?
why does journaling help so much?
为什么有移情心的治疗师
Why does therapy with an empathic therapist
他们的治疗这么有效?
why does it work so well?
因为我们活出了自我
Because we are ourselves
我们没有想着在治疗师面前表现自己
we don't try impress the therapist
一段时间后 我们打开心扉
After a while we open up
我们没有想着在日记里表现自己
We don't try to impress our journal
我们活出了自我
We are ourselves
从让我们感觉良好的日记扩展到
And expanding it from our journal which makes us feel good
亲近的关系和人
to close relationships, to others
从一天一次对话中练习正直
from doing it one day one conversation at a time
到坚持一周 然后坚持一生
to a week of integrity treatment so to speak to lifelong
想象一下 过这样的生活
Imagine leading this life
当你不用再不停地表达或表现自己时
how freed up do we feel when you no longer need to express
我们会感到多自由
or impress ourselves constantly
我们能够被了解
where we can just be known
能够活出自我
where we can just be ourselves
这样会多轻松
how much lighter
多有力量
how much more power
我们会觉得多正直和真实
how much more integrity and authenticity we will experience
我们会多快乐?
how much happier will we be?
我想在下课前读一段Melissa Christino的日记
I want to end by reading you an excerpt from Melissa Christino's journal
是她在她的毕业论文中引用的
which she cited in her senior thesis
当然这是得到她允许的
This, of course is with her permission
Melissa Christino是哈佛本科毕业生 2002届
Melissa Christino was an undergraduate here, class of 
她是这样写的
And this is what she writes
"你真正的潜力
"Your true potential lies way
埋藏在你的灵魂深处
way down in the depths of your soul...
在你腹部最底处
in the pit of your stomach
在你的知识和紧张触及不到的地方
past your knowledge, beyond your nervousness
埋藏在你的恐惧和焦虑之下
and buried under your fears and anxieties
虽然它隐藏起来了
As hidden as it may be
但它还在那里
it is still there
我知道 因为我以前感受过它的存在
I know it's there because I've felt it before
我知道别人也有
and I know it's there in others too
因为我见过别人做过奇迹一般的事
because I've seen others perform miracles
我们体内都有一股无可匹敌的潜力 散发着微弱的光芒
There is a faint glow of unparalleled potential in all of us
当我们找到它时 它就会发出万丈光芒"
and when we find it — it shine."
我们每个人都有这丝微光
It's there in each and every one of us - this glow
如果我们助长它 培养它 它就会壮大
And if we feed it, if we cultivate it, it grows
它就会壮大到超越自己
And it grows to the level that expands beyond the self
这时候 像Warren Bennis这样的人
where people like Warren Bennis
像曼德拉这样的人
where people like Nelson Mandela
像Anita Roddick这样的人
where people like Anita Roddick
像特蕾莎修女这样的人 他们的存在
people like mother Teresa - just their presence
他们的存在 就能为别人散发光芒
just their presence, their being shines a light onto others
现在我想这样做
So what I'd like you to do now
只剩四分钟
we have 4 more minute
我想这样做
here's what I'd like to do now
我会放一首歌给大家听
I'm going to play a song for yo
通常我会在上课前放的
usually played at the beginning
但今天我想在最后才放
I want to play it at the end today
如果你们喜欢的话
If you feel comfortable
可以闭上眼睛 听歌词
you can close your eyes and listen to the words of the song
它们对你有什么意义
and what they mean to you
对你的生活有什么意义
what they mean in the context of your life
所以如果你们喜欢
So if you feel comfortable
闭上眼睛听
close your eyes, and listen
听听以下的歌词
really listen to the following words
我就是我
I am what I am
我独一无二
I am my own special creation
看我一眼
So come take a look
对我嗤之以鼻
Give me the hook
或为我鼓掌
Or the ovation
这是我的世界
It's my world
我想拥有一点骄傲
That I want to have a little pride in
我的世界
My world
在这里我不用躲藏
And it's not a place I have to hide in
生命毫无价值
Life's not worth a damn
直到你能说
Till you can say
我就是我
I am what I am
睁开眼睛
Open your eyes!
来吧 上来
C'mon! Get up
我就是我
I am what I am
好的 我们下去
All right. Let's go down
和他们一起跳
Let's join them
</p>
