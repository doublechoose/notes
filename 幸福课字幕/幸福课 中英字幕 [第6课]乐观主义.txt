幸福课 中英字幕 [第6课]乐观主义
Hope you had a wonderful long weekend.
好了 直入主题
So,let's jump right into it.
上回说到哪儿了
So where did we leave last time?
上回我们谈了环境的力量
Last time we talked about the power of the situation,
谈到了信念是如何成为自我实现的预言
we talk about how beliefs become self -fulfilling prophesies.
以及我们是如何通过环境
And how it is through the situation
对他人产生期望及信念
that we very often create expectations,believes of people.
这些信念会变成现实
And these believes become reality.
还谈到了为什么说社会心理学本质上是从
And we talked about how social psychology essentially started
某些重要的实验开始的 比如米尔格伦实验
with some very important experiment such as the Milgrim effect,
又称权利服从研究
or obedience to authority.
比如津巴多的监狱实验
Such as Zimbardo's prison experiment,
试验中 囚犯被关在...
where prisoners were put in or played...
学生扮演囚犯及看守的角色
students play the role of prisoners or the role of wardens
完全进入了角色 以至于
and they actually entered that role so totally
一周后实验被迫中止
that after a week the experiment had to be stop,
而原计划是要进行两周
when it was suppose to go on for two weeks.
接着我们提出了一个问题
And then the question we asked was,
既然环境的力量如此巨大
OK,so we know that the situation is powerful.
能使人改变
We know that it makes a difference.
那能否创造出一种强大但积极的环境
Can we also create a powerful,
将人的最佳状态充分调动起来?
positive situation to bring out the best in people?
答案是肯定的
And the answer is yes.
我们对此做了深入分析 并谈到了
And we started talking about it and we talk about professor
Langer教授以及她的研究
Langer and her research and how she show that putting
她让一群老人置身于仿20年前的环境中
um...elderly men in an environment where they were actually
要求他们装作回到20年前的生活
or where they acted as if they were 20 years younger
这些老人竟然变得年轻了
actually became younger.
他们的智力水平提高了
To the point of having higher levels of intelligence.
记忆力提升了
To the point of improving their memory.
视力听力也改善了
Improving their eyesight,improving their hearing.
手指骨骼间的距离变长了
The distance between the bones in their fingers actually
这是年轻的迹象
became longer which is a sign of younger age.
他们自评及互评都认为
They were rated by others as well as by themselves
自己更健康 更年轻了
as stronger and younger just because they acted as if
就因为他们装作自己处在1959年
it was 1959 instead of what it was really was,
而不是1979年 这就是积极环境的力量
which was 1979. The power of the positive situation.
她还进行了另一项实验
And then she did another more research on
对象要进行视力检查
people going for an eyesight test,
他们被安排在了飞行模拟器里
and put them in a situation in a flight simulator.
做完全一样的视力检查
And the exact same eyesight test,
因为环境的不同 测试结果竟然提高了
they actually performed better just because of the situation.
然后我们接着继续讲 上回结束的地方就是
And we moved on that what we ended last time
分析影射 影射是...
by talking about priming. Priming is...
可以从意识及潜意识两个层面进行
can be done in the conscious or subconscious level.
是指在我们的意识或潜意识中植入
It means planting a seed,planting a belief,planting a word,
一粒种子 一种信念 一个词或一幅画面
or a picture in our mind,consciously or subconsciously.
以及如何对我们行为产生影响
And how that actually influences our behavior.
Bargh在纽约大学时
So Bargh,that time of NYU,
进行过一项研究 他用"年老"的相关词
did the research where he primed to people
影射实验对象
with words associated with old.
如果你们还记得 这些词包括皱纹
Words if you remember such as wrinkles,
年老 佛罗里达
words such as old,words such as Florida.
这种影射导致的结果是
And as a result of this priming,
实验参与者走路更慢了
those participants in the study actually walked slower,
更佝偻了
or actually were more stooped.
研究者进行评估时
When evaluated by researchers
并不知道每个对象的实验条件
who were not aware of their condition,meaning they didn't know
也就是说不清楚他们是被影射了对照词
whether they were primed with control words,
随机词 还是年老相关词
just random words,or with words associated with old.
所以通过影射 人们的行为
So it was just through the priming that people actually
的确会发生改变
started to behave differently.
环境的力量 外界的力量
The power of the situation. The power of the environment.
然后Bargh将实验更进了一步
And then Bargh took it step further and said,
决定用使用积极的影射 比如成就
OK,let's prime the with positive primes such as achievement,
毅力 成功
such as persistence,such as success.
比如这些词
These words,for example,
成就的近义词
they had to find a synonym for the word achievement.
实验对象被影射这些词后
Those who are primed with these words on intelligence test
智力及记忆力测试的成绩
and on memory test actually performed better
比没有影射的对照组好
than the control group who wasn't primed with these words.
两位荷兰研究人员Dijksterhuis和Knippensberg
Two Dutch researchers - Dijksterhuis &amp; Knippensberg,
也进行了影射实验 他们找了一批人
what they found was that they brought people,
请他们为下一次实验进行描述
and they ask them to describe for future experiment,
不是本次实验
not for that experiment.
让他们为下一次实验
For a future experiment,ask them to describe
描述三种原型的典型日常行为及其性格:
the typical day or typical characteristics of three archetypes -
足球流氓 秘书及教授
a soccer hooligan,a secretary and a professor.
描述这三种原型
Describe these three archetypes.
他们被告知 这是为下次实验做准备
And they told them this is for the next experiment
需要这三种原型的描述
where we just want people to evaluate these archetypes.
但他们不知道的是 通过对原型进行描述
Not knowing that actually by describing these archetypes,
自己已经被影射了
these individuals were primed.
他们分别被影射为足球流氓 秘书
They were primed for a soccer hooligan,for a secretary,
或教授
or for a professor.
影射后 他们接受了智力测试
And then they have to do intelligence tests afterwards,
及记忆力测试
memory test after those primes.
描述足球流氓日常行为的人
Those who had to describe the day of soccer hooligan
表现得最糟
performed the worse.
无论是记忆力还是智力
In terms of memory. In term of intelligence.
然后是描述秘书的人
Then there was the secretary and those who performed the best
表现最好的 是描述教授的人
were those who described the professor.
而他们之前并没有更努力学习
Now they didn't study any harder before.
什么也没有改变 除了发生了影射
Nothing changed except for the fact that there was a prime,that
环境中有东西植入了他们的思想
there was something planted from the environment in their minds.
现在的问题是
The question then is,
我们如何为自己创造一个积极的环境
how can we create a positive environment for ourselves,
让自己受到积极的影射 变得更幸福
where we are primed by the positive,where we can be happier,
更成功等等
more successful and so on.
方法有很多
And there's many ways in which we can do it.
我跟大家分享几个
Let me share a few.
其实这将是你们这周的作业之一
In fact there's going to be your assignment for this week,
即创造一个积极的环境
or one of the assignments to create a positive environment.
举几个例子
So you are some of the examples.
找一些你爱的人或地方的照片
Have pictures of people you love or places you love,the
这些东西很重要 因为即使你不看它们
importance of these things is that even if you don't see them,
潜意识中还意识到它们的存在
you see them. So on the subconscious level it's still there.
虽然只是在潜意识层面
Even though on the subconscious level,
人们被影射时 看不见...那些词
when people are primed,they don't really see...the word,
比如"成就"这个词出现在屏幕上25毫秒
say achievement on the screen,when it's there for 25 mini-second,
根本不可能看清 但大脑却记录了下来
they don't really see it,but it registers.
所以即使你挂了照片但没去看它
So even if a picture is there and you don't "really" see it
或没意识到它 念到它
or not really conscious of it,mindful of it,
它仍然会对你造成影响
it still has a impact on you.
所以找些你爱的人的照片
So have pictures of people you love,
让你开心的东西 无论是纪念品
have pleasant object,whether it's memorabilia,
鲜花 艺术品 你最喜欢的艺术品
whether it's flowers,whether it's art,your favorite art.
我家中和办公室都挂了
So I have in my house,and my office,
我最爱的画 由我最爱的艺术家创作
my favorite art on the wall,by my favorite artists.
让我跟你们分享一下
And let me share with you a few.
我今天带到课堂上来了 它们价值连城
I actually brought them here. These are very valuable.
我给它们投了保 所以不用担心 瞧
I insured them,so it's not a problem. So... so this is,um,
这位画家处在艺术生涯第一阶段时的作品
this specific artist from the first phase of his career,
如你所见 充满了有力的线条
as you can see,you know,very powerful strokes,
非常强烈 非常从容 真是绝了
very intense,very deliberate,and just gorgeous.
另外一幅
And here is,
仍是那位画家 进入艺术生涯第二阶段
by the same artist from the second phase of his career.
印象派对他作品的影响已经清晰可辨了
Here you already begin to see impressionist influence
不过你仍能从中看出同样的特点
on his work. But still,you know you see the same trait,
同样的力量 同样强烈的情感
the same power,the same intensity.
这些都挂在我家墙上
So I have these on my wall.
我还想向你们介绍一位画坛新秀
There's a new and upcoming artist who I want to introduce you to.
她还没进入第二阶段
She still doesn't have a second phase,
因为她才一岁大
you know,she's only one year's old.
这幅画是在她妈妈帮助下完成的
But,you know,this is a work done with the help of her Mom.
但是我还是挂在墙上 每天提醒我
But again,these are on my wall and they remind me everyday
虽然我已经看过几百次了
even I've seen them hundreds of time,
但还是挂着 让我想起我的孩子们
it's still there and I think about my kids.
我挂了些其他的...
And I also have other,you know,
名气不比他们的画家作品
less known artists' work on my wall.
你们可能没听过这画
Again,this is,probably not heard of this one,
这是罗丹的《沉思者》
um,this is Rodin,The Thinker.
也挂在我的墙上 是我最喜欢的雕塑
And,so I have this on my wall,it's my favorite sculpture.
还有罗丹的另一幅作品
And then I have another piece by Rodin just to remind me
提醒我生活不仅要沉思 还有其他的
that it's not all about thinking,there are other things
让生活更美好
that make life make life worth living.
这是罗丹的《吻》
So this is Rodin's The Kiss,for those of you who know it.
所以找些东西挂在墙上
And again have these things on your wall
创造一种让你觉得温暖
create(s) the environment where you feel warm,
觉得开心的环境
where it's fun for you to be there.
名人名言 我喜欢名人名言
Quotes,you know I love quotes,
你们很多人肯定也喜欢
and I know that many of you love quotes.
已经有人把他们最喜欢的名言发我了
Some of you have sent me your favorite quotes.
我墙上也有一列名言
I have on my wall a list of quotes and they are there
就算我没看它们 也能感受到
even if I don't see them,I see them.
比如 让我看看有没有带来
So for example,let's see if I brought some here.
好 在这里呢
Yes,here they are.
这句说亚当斯总统说的
So one is by John Quincy Adams.
"耐心和坚持总能奇迹般地
"Patience and perseverance have a magical effect before
扫除困难和障碍"
which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish".
将"坚持"用于影射
So priming the issue of persistence,
插一句 Bargh的实验也囊括了这个词
by the way which is one thing that Bargh did it.
受到影射的人的确变得更坚韧不拔
He primed that and people actually became more persistent.
乔治.艾略特 原名玛丽.安妮.艾凡斯
George Eliot,or also known as Mary Anne Evens,
我最喜欢的作家 她写过"推动
my favorite author. She wrote," The important work of moving
人类进步的重任 不能等待完人来完成"
the world forward does not wait to be done by perfect men".
大约三周后 我会讲到完美主义
I'll talk about perfectionism which is a very important,
对我个人来说是非常重要的私人话题
very personal thing for me in about three weeks.
可以说她是我的榜样
So she is a very much a role model.
加缪说过"在深冬里 我终于发现在
Camus,"In the depth of winter,I finally learned
心里有个不败的夏天"
that there was within me an invincible summer".
这句话帮助我走过了艰难困苦
A quote that has helped me through difficult,through hard times.
亨利.戴维.梭罗
Henry David Thoreau,
"如果一个人能昂首挺胸地朝着梦想前进
"If one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams,
努力实现他想象的生活
and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined,
他会与成功不期而遇"
he will meet with success,unexpected in common hours ".
同样地 我都挂在了墙上 还有其他的
Again,I have these quotes up on my wall,and a few others,
其中许多名言你们都在课上读到过了
that many of the quotes that you've seen in the course.
它们不断影射我 提醒我
And they prime me,they remind me,
为我创造出积极的环境
they create the environment for me.
我们会在下一节讨论艺术及其重要性
We'll talk about art in the next section,and its importance.
把喜欢的书放在手边 听听音乐
Have you favorite books next to you. Listen to music,
要集中注意听
but listen to it mindfully,
不要只当背景音乐 要让音乐激发你
not just as background music but the music that inspires you,
185
无论是摇滚 还是痞子阿姆 都可以
whether it's rocky,whether it's Eminem,whoever it is.
多看看激励你的电影
Watch films that inspire you,
这些东西能帮你创造积极的环境
all these things help you to create an environment
有助于成长 获得成功与产生幸福感
that is conducive to growth,to success,to well being.
其中大部分都是在潜意识层面上进行的
A lot of this is done on the subconscious level
这就是影射的力量 对于影射的研究
which is the power of the priming. A priming studies.
这也是积极研究的意义
And finally this is what positive research is about.
如果我们总是关注"消极"研究 焦虑
If we constantly focus on "negative" research,anxiety,
压抑 精神分裂症 就会被这些研究影射
depression,schizophrenia,we are primed by this research,
被这些工作影射 创造出现实
we are primed by this work. And it creates reality.
你们有些人可能知道
You know,this indirectly and conjunctionally relates to,
这与冰山理论有这千丝万缕的联系
some of you may know,the Isenberg principle,
即当你度量某种现象时
is that when you measure a phenomenon,
就是在改变这种现象
you are changing the phenomenon;
当你度量某种现象时
when you are measuring a phenomenon,
也是在改变自己
you are also changing yourself.
所以通过研究积极环境 我们也是在
So by researching the positive we are also priming ourselves
对自己影射积极的东西
with the positive.
今天包括下周 我谈到的很多内容
Now,a lot of this work that I'm talking about today and I'll talk
其实都是源于自助运动
about next time actually comes from the self-help movement.
自助运动确立于20世纪
In many ways the self-help movement was founded,
并从各个方面展开
was started in the 20th century...
其理论基础为我们通过思考创建了世界
was started with the understanding that we create the world
我们的思维创建了时间
through our thinking,that our mind creates the world.
1930年代相关书籍开始出版
And books like these came out,back in the 1930's,
比如《思考致富》
Thinking Grow Rich.
从30年代至今销售超过6千万本
This book since 1930's sold over 60 million copies.
而且仍不断再版
It's still selling.
至今还是畅销书 不论在美国
It's selling,it's the best seller in the US,
中国 印度
it's the best seller in China,in India,
非洲还是欧洲
it's the best seller in Africa,it's the best seller in Europe.
它对人们产生了巨大影响
It has an impact on people and here's one of the things
作者Napoleon Hill这样说过
that Napoleon Hill says,
"只要你想得到 只要你相信 你就能够做到"
"Whatever your mind can conceive and believe,it can achieve."
只要你想得到 只要你相信 你就能够做到
Whatever your mind can conceive and believe,it can achieve.
非常鼓舞人心
Very empowering.
对各类人群 对大众产生了很多影响
And this had an impact on many different people,on the masses,
6千万本销量 史上最畅销书籍
again,60 million copies,one of the best sellers in history.
Henry Ford也发表过类似的看法
Henry Ford had a similar idea,
"不论你认为自己行还是不行 你都是对的"
"Whether you think you can or can't,you are right."
许多人都这一理念吸引 为什么
And people were drawn to this message. Why?
因为它鼓舞人心
Because it's empowering,
让他们觉得没有什么不可能的
because it makes them feel that things are possible.
另一本极具影响力的书
Another very influential book,
Norman Vincent Peale的《正面思考的力量》
The Power of Positive Thinking,Norman Vincent Peale.
"要有美好的希望 并全力以赴去追求
"Have great hopes and dare to go all out for them.
要有远大的梦想 并全力以赴去实现
Have great dreams and dare to live them.
要有宏伟的期望 并深信不疑"
Have tremendous expectations and believe in them."
多么让人为之一振啊
How inspiring for people to hear that,
只要你思考
all you need to do is think,
只要你相信 就会获得富足
all you need to do is believe,and affluence will come to you.
无论是精神的富足
Whether it's intrapersonal affluence,
还是物质的富足
whether it's monetary affluence.
这一理念对大众一直有着巨大吸引力
And this is been the message that has drawn the masses
时至今日仍是如此
and continues to do so today.
当今最畅销的励志书
The best selling book today,
全球销量第一 没错 《秘密》
No.1 best seller all over the world,that's right,The Secret.
成功的秘密就是 所谓的"吸引力法则"
The secret to success is,what they call,the law of attraction.
即 你的生活是被你吸引过来的
The law of attraction is that you attract to your life
无论你想象什么 无论你相信什么
whatever you imaging,whatever you believe it.
有一条强大的讯息
Again,a powerful message,
本书已经卖出了几百万本
millions and millions of copies of this book being sold.
就在我们说话当口 仍在热卖
As we speak,continue to be sold.
而它传达的讯息其实很简单:相信就会成功
And the message is again simple: believe,and you will achieve;
构想就会实现
conceive,and it will be conceived.
在现实中就会实现
In reality,in the world,it will come to you.
让人信服 鼓舞人心
Very convincing,very inspiring message.
但是 这条讯息正确吗
But,is this message right?
这我们讨论过 还有Roger Bannister的故事
Well,we talked about this and we saw the Roger Bannister story.
他在4分钟 准确说是3'59跑完了1英里
You know one day,or six weeks after Roger Bannister runs
6周后John Landy将这一成绩缩短到3'57.
a mile in 4 minutes,or in 3'59,John Landy runs it in 3'57.9.
一年后37名运动员都能跑到4分内了
The year after 37 runners run the mile in under 4 minutes.
其中有一定奥妙
So there is something to it.
一但他们相信能办到 就有可能实现
Once they believed it was possible,it became possible.
但问题是
And here is the issue,
当今的心理自助运动的发展趋势
with much of what's going on in the self-help today,
当今的自助领域强调某个真相
self-help realm today,it draws on a truth,
将这个真相过分鼓吹
a real truth and then blows it out of proportion.
没错
So yes,
某种意义上我们的精神的确能创造现实
there is some truth in the fact that our mind creates reality.
但是这不是全部
But that's only part of the truth.
我们创造了现实 或者说是共同创造
We create reality or rather we co-create reality.
还会受到外界或者内在的某些影响
There has to be something out there or in there,
比如《秘密》
for example,when it comes to The Secret.
如果你相信自己可能会成功
If you believe that you are likely to succeed,
那成功的可能性会变大
you are much more likely to succeed.
但离不开刻苦勤奋与坚持不懈
But that has to come with a lot of hard work and persistence,
而且失败避免不了
it has to come with a lot of failure,
你要从失败中学习
and learning from that failure.
所以这只是等式的一半 而这些自助书籍
So it's just half of the equation and what these self-help books
传达的讯息往往言过其实 效果甚微
and messages do is overpromise and under-deliver,
甚至可能会造成毁灭性后果
which at times can be destructive.
比如 如果一切皆建立于吸引力法则上
For example,if everything is based on the law of attraction.
我创造了一切
I created everything that
一切都因我而变 一切都是我的错
everything is up to me and also everything is my fault.
举个极端点的例子
Even taking to the extreme,
如果3岁小女孩被虐待 那是她的责任吗
is a 3 years old girl responsible for being abused?
30岁的男子被酒醉驾车的司机撞成瘫痪
Is a 30 years old man responsible for being paralyzed
是他自己的责任吗
as a result of an accident by a drunken driver?
有些事情是我们无法控制的
There are certain things that are out there
所以一切因我而变
and when we say that everything is up to us,
一切都由吸引力法则决定
everything is created by the law of attraction,
这种说法短期内可能能让你
then it's a prescription maybe in the short term for inspiration
坚定信念 获得幸福感 但是长期来看
and for belief and for wellbeing,but in the long term,
只会让人感到挫败 内疚 不快乐
it's for frustration,for guilt,and for unhappiness.
00:17:01,020 --&gt; 00:17:02,900
离成功越来越远
And also for less success
因为如果我真的相信一切都由思考决定
because if I really believe that it's all about thinking,
这种想法就会成为我的心态习惯
then this is going to be my mind set.
只要有信心
All I need to do is believe and then
钱就会滚滚而来
all the money will come to me.
爱情就会降临于我
All the success in a relationship will come to me.
这抹杀了勤奋工作...
And that does away with the hard work,
坚韧不拔以及失败的作用
with the persistence,with the failure that is necessary,
它们也是成功 幸福 完满人生的必要组成部分
part and parcel of a successful,happy,fulfilling,human life.
我给大家放一段短片
I want to show you a quick video.
是我在网上看到的一段广告
This is of an ad I saw online and I actually called the
于是我向苏格兰皇家银行索要了原版
Royal Bank on Scotland and asked them to send me the original.
因为它抓住了当今人们对精神力量的
Because it captures some of the misunderstanding
某种误解
that there is today about the power of the mind.
很诙谐的一则广告
Just a very cute ad.
Douglas 也是参加会议的
Douglas from the conference.
00:17:55,160 --&gt; 00:17:56,740
- James Aderson - 你好
- James Aderson. - Oh,yeah.
这儿风景真不错
That's a lot of green.
那是什么鸟？
What kind of bird is it?
- 怎么回事 - 不知道
- What's that?   - I don't know.
没事的 各位 我上过一门课程
It's ok guys! I've done a course.
- 什么? - 正面思考
-What? -Positive thinking.
正面的思考会产生正面的影响
Positive thought makes a positive impact.
明白不 正面的思考会产生正面的影响
OK? Positive thought has a positive impact.
看着我 没事的 来
Look at me. That's right. Okay,come on.
(紧急启动)
(Emergency Start)
语言不能代替行动
Talk is no substitute for action.
这就是思想的力量
That's the power.
创造现实 苏格兰皇家银行集团
Make it happen. The Royal Bank of Scotland Group.
- 我真厉害 - 真的耶
- I am good. - Yes,you are.
它抓住了部分真相 但不是全部
It captures part of the truth but not the whole truth.
我们看看严肃研究
So let's see what serious research
对精神力量的解释
has to say about the power of the mind.
一种神奇的现象
A real phenomenon,actual phenomenon,but one
但还是需要通过实验来研究其原理
that we need to also apply real research to see what works.
Albert Bandura 你们本周的阅读任务
Albert Bandura,on your reading about for this week,
做了许多关于自我效能的研究
has done a lot of work on the concept of self-efficacy
本质上是自信的学术术语
which is essentially the academic term for believing in oneself.
以下是他进行几十年研究后的结论
And here is what he writes after decades and decades of research.
去年他获得了授予积极心理学家的
He by the way won the researcher's prize for
研究者奖项
the positive psychologists last year
进行了很多这方面的研究 他是斯坦福大学的教授
so he's doing a lot of research in this area. He's from Stanford.
"自我效能感影响人们生活选择
"Beliefs in personal efficacy affect life choices,
动机水平 机能的质量 对逆境的适应力
level of motivation,quality of functioning,resilience to
对压力和沮丧的抵抗力
adversity and vulnerability to stress and depression."
相信自己的人 充满信心
Those you believe in themselves,who have confidence,
在生活的不同领域都表现出色 他还指出
do well across the different areas in their lives,He continues,
认为自己高效能者
"People who regard themselves as highly efficacious act,think,
与认为自己无用者
and feel differently from those who perceive themselves
想法感觉完全不同
as inefficacious.
他们创造自己的未来 而不是简单地梦想
They produce their own future,rather than simply foretell it."
换句话说 他所说的是
In other words,what he's talking about here is that
对生活充满信心的人
these people are scribed in their lives.
他们创造自己的人生 与那些
They create their own lives as oppose to those
由他人摆布的人不同 他们适应力更强
that are being prescribed by others. They are more resilient,
对困难与挫折的应对力更强
better able to deal with hardships and difficulties.
换句话说 能力更强
In other words,better capacity
我们之前讨论过应对挫折的问题
as we discussed earlier to deal with difficulties.
这项研究的重要性在于 经过长年累月的
Now the important thing about this research,
研究发现 这些能力是可以习得的
in his research over the years is that it can be learned.
可以慢慢培养
It's cultivated over time.
否则研究就是无用的 至少对我们来说是
So it would be useless if,in terms of research,
如果通过研究他得出结论
at least for us if he would say,
说这种能力只是天生的
well,some people are born with it,and others are not.
有些人天生就有适应力基因
Some people are born with,what they started to talk about,
其他人没有
the resilience gene,and others are not born with that.
幸好情况不是这样
But that's not the case.
他的研究表明这些都可以习得的
What he has shown is that it can be learned.
但要花时间和经历
It takes time,it takes effort,
我们以后会讨论如何培养
and we will talk about later how we do it.
重要的是 这些能力是可以锻炼的
But the important thing,it's malleable.
我们可以改变它
We can do something about it.
Curry做过一项关于运动员的研究
Other research by Curry on college athletes,
下面一定坐着许多运动员
I know there are many athletes in this room.
她证明了一旦成为运动员
She showed that 56% of your successes as an athlete,
56%的成功是由期望度决定的
once you start being an athlete,is determined by levels of hope,
成功取决于你坚信自己能取得成功的程度
by how much you believe that you are going to succeed.
记得第一或第二节课上
Remember from very first or second class
我提到了John Carter的研究
where I talked about the research by John Carter,
有关商...哈佛商学院毕业生的
about the business...HBS graduates.
他预测...
Where he predicted...
有两个因素会影响他们的长期成功
where the two things predicted success in the long term,
某些毕业生会格外成功
extraordinary success of these grads.
一是他们不断地提问
One was that they were constantly asking questions,
二是他们相信自己
and two was that they believed in themselves.
他们相信自己能行
They thought they could do well.
但需要意识到的是
But it's important to also realize that
不是所有这些差异
it's not 100 percent of the variances that was explained,
都能用希望 信念或乐观来解释的
by hope,or by belief,or by optimism,
很多自助书籍想引导我们这么认为
as many of the self-help books would have us believe.
但当然这些是成功的一部分
But it's certainly part of the equation of success.
Nathaniel Branden从事心理治疗50年了
Nathaniel Branden has been a therapist for fifty years;
他做过许多严谨全面的哲学及心理学研究
he's done a lot of rigorous philosophical and psychological
致力于对自尊概念的探究
research and work on the concept of self-esteem.
等我们进行到自尊课时
We'll visit him more in-depth when we talk about,
会详细讲他的研究
when we have the week on self-esteem.
现在我只引用他的一句话
But for now,just a quick quote:
"我们每个人自尊的水平
"the level of our self-esteem,in another words,
也就是自信的程度
the level of our belief in ourselves,
对我们的方方面面有着深远的影响
has profound consequences for every aspect of our existence:
比如我们的待人接物
how we operate in the workplace,how we deal with people,
能取得的地位 能取得多少成就
how high we are likely to rise,how much we are likely to achieve
还比如在个人领域
and,in the personal realm,
我们会与谁坠入爱河
with whom we are likely to fall in love,
我们与配偶 孩子及朋友的关系
how we interact with our spouse,children,and friends,
个人幸福的水平"
what level of personal happiness we attain."
物质富足与幸福感
Very low levels of correlation
或生活地点与幸福感
between material affluence and wellbeing,
属于低度线性相关
or between where we live and wellbeing,
而自尊与幸福感属于高度线性相关
very high correlation between self-esteem and wellbeing.
大多数研究发现两者的相关系数
In most research what we found is a 0.7 correlation
可以达到0.
between the two constructs.
我的论文也获得了相同结论
This is what I found in my dissertation as well.
所以自尊非常重要
So self-esteem matters.
内在因素很重要 我们提高自信水平时
The internal matters and what we are doing when we enhance
发生在我们身上的是
when we raise our levels of belief in ourselves
我们在转变精神 改变"容器"
is we are transforming our mind,we are changing the form,
这样我们看世界的角度不同了
so that we see we interact,we see the world differently,
有了不同的理解与感悟
we perceive different things,
处事待人的方法不同了
we experience things in a different way.
庆祝成功
Whether it's successes that we then celebrate,
从失败中学习 转化为机遇
or failures that we then learn from and turn into opportunities.
但最重要的是我们的内在
But so much of it is about what we have inside here.
Branden说过"自我概念即命运"
Branden,"self-concept is destiny."
与"只要你想得到 只要你相信 你就能够做到"
Very similar to"whatever your mind can conceive,it can achieve"
非常相似 Napoleon Hill说的
from Napoleon Hill.
唯一的不同之处是
The only difference being that he also
他对此进行了严谨细致的思考与研究
puts a lot of rigorous thinking and research there
以证明信仰的局限性
and shows the limitation of the belief.
这一领域的另一个研究
Here is another example of research done in the area
大多数都听说过
which most people know about.
安慰剂效应
The Placebo effect.
你头痛 去看医生
You go to the doctor,you have a headache,
医生说 我给你开种药
the doctor tells you: here I have a pill for you.
非常有效 新出的
The best thing. Just came out recently.
能治疗你的头痛
Will help you get over the headache.
你吃了药 头不痛了
Gives you the pill. You get over the headache.
你不知道的是 她给你的其实是糖球
Unbeknownst to you,what she gave you was,a sugar pill.
但是因为你以为
But because you thought,
因为你相信它能治好头痛
because you believed that it would help your headache,
还真治好了 真是神药啊
it actually did help your headache. Real phenomena medicine.
于是Herbert Benson 在河对岸
So Herbert Benson,from the across the river,
医学院的老师
from the medical school here,
对此做了一系列研究
has done a lot of research in this area.
我着重跟大家讲两个
Let me share with you just two of his studies.
他找了一些处在妊娠期
What Benson did was bringing women who had,
胃部不适的妇女
who were pregnant,and who had stomach problems...
她们都有呕吐恶心的症状
they were vomiting,they were throwing up,they were nauseous,
这其实挺常见的
something which is relatively common
尤其是在怀孕初期的三个月
especially in the first trimester of pregnancy.
他告诉她们
So he brought them in and told them,
"这里有一种新药
"I have this new pill for you
能缓解你们胃部不适
that will help you overcome your stomach distress.
治疗呕吐症状
You won't throw up any more after;
非常有效
this is a very powerful and good pill."
于是他把药给了她们
So he gave them that pill and they got over
她们的胃部就好了
their stomach distress,they were better.
当然 她们不知道那只是安慰剂
They didn't know of course this was just a placebo drug,
普通的糖丸
just a sugar pill.
然后他将实验更进一步
Then he took it step further,
找来了另一组有同样胃部不适
brought in another group of women with the exact
呕吐症状的妇女
same stomach distress,with the same vomiting.
把药给她们
Gave them the pill,
告诉她们可以缓解胃病
he told them would help them overcome their stomach distress.
但是这次 他给的不再是糖丸
Only this time,instead of a sugar pill,
而是小剂量
he actually gave them small dosage,
没有危险性的小剂量的吐根
not dangerous but small dosage of ipecac.
你们可能知道吐根...
Now those of you who know what ipecac is...
是催吐时服用的药物
It's a drug that we take if we want to throw up.
如果发生食物中毒
So if we have food poisoning,
就需要服用吐根催吐
we take these drugs and it will actually elicit vomiting.
他给这些病人服用了吐根
So he gave them this drug and again,
这一实验通过了道德审查 没有风险
this passed all the ethic reviews and was not dangerous,you know
他给这些病人服用了吐根
But that's what he did.
并告诉她们能治疗呕吐
And these women were told that they'd get better.
而她们也的确恢复了健康
And they did get better.
本来应该出现的呕吐症状不仅没有出现
Not only did they not vomit as they should have done,
由于服用了吐根更该呕吐的 实际上呕吐却停止了
more so with the ipecac,they actually stopped.
我给大家读一段摘录自他的《永恒的治疗》
Let me read to you an excerpt from his book,
我非常推荐这本书
which I highly recommend,Timeless Healing.
"引人注目地是 病人的恶心感与呕吐反应
I quote,"Remarkably,the patients' nausea
完全终止了 且根胃内水球测量
and vomiting ceased entirely and their stomach contractions,
胃胀现象也消失了 恢复正常
as measured through the balloons,returned to normal.
因为她们相信她们服用的是止吐药
Because they believed they received anti-nausea medicine,
竟然逆转了催吐药的作用
the women reversed the proven action of a powerful drug.
虽然很多人在医药箱储存了吐根
Even though many of us stock our medicine cabinets and first aid
以防食物中毒发生
kits with ipecac to bring about vomiting in case of poisoning,
这些胃部不适的孕妇
these pregnant women with documented stomach distress thwarted
却抵御了本该让她们更难受的催吐药物
the action of a drug that should have made them even sicker.
单凭信仰就治好了病痛
With belief alone,they cured themselves."
但这不是说药物没有效果
Now,this doesn't mean that drugs don't have an effect.
我不推荐大家回家以后
You know,I don't recommend going home now and,
给你们的室友
you know,giving your roommates,
服用吐根 甚至氰化物
you know,ipecac or even worse cyanide
然后告诉他们这是维生素C
and then tell them this is actually Vitamin C.
他们一般不会感觉好
they will probably not feel better or healthier as a result.
但这一实验
But what this experiment dose,
及其他类似实验表明
and many others like it show is that powerful effect
我们不应忽视精神的强大力量
of the mind which we shouldn't discard.
而需要研究并理解它
We need to study it and understand.
Benson在他的书中还写到了另一个实验
Well,here is another experiment that Benson writes
这项实验是在日本进行的
about in his book. This was done in Japan.
实验对象对某种植物过敏
So,people who are allergic to a specific plant
他们被蒙着眼睛带进实验室
were brought into a lab,had their eyes closed,and then,
研究人员用过敏植物碰触他们一只手臂
they had these plant touch their forearm,
然后用另一种植物碰触另一只手臂
and then they had another plant touch their other forearm,
但没有告诉他们哪边是过敏植物
and they didn't know which was which.
理论上被过敏植物碰触的手臂
And of course that plant that they were allergic to,
会发出了疹子 出现过敏反应
the arm flared up. They were allergic to it after all.
但是 实验还有另一个条件
But then,their was a second condition,
他们被告知会过敏的植物
these people were told that the actual drug(plant)
碰触了他们的左手
that they are allergic to touched their left hand,
不会导致过敏的植物
and another plant that they were not allergic to
碰触了他们的右手
touched their right hand.
但是Benson将两者对调了
But Benson reversed the effect,
即真正会导致过敏的植物
so actually the plant that they were allergic to
碰触的是他们的右手 而不会导致过敏的
touched their right hand,and the plant that
碰触的是他们的左手
they were not allergic to touched their left hand.
所以按理说 应该右手起疹子 而非左手
So they were supposed to flare up on the right,not on the left.
但是因为他们误以为左边的才是
But because they believed that the allergic plant
过敏植物 所以左手起了疹子
was on the left,their left hand flared up,
而右手没有
their right hand did not.
因为精神的力量
Based on the power of the mind.
但同样的 这并不是说外在因素不重要
Once again,this does not mean that the external doesn't matter
也不说明生活中的一切都是被吸引过来的
and that we attracted everything that we want to into our lives,
但是这的确证明了精神
but it does mean that the mind plays a very important role
对构建我们的生理 情感 认知
in creating our physical,certainly emotional,
以及外在环境起了重要作用
cognitive as well as external reality.
信念常常会成为自我实现的预言
Beliefs very often become self-fulfilling prophecies.
但它是如何作用的呢?
But how does it work? How does it work?
我想跟大家分享一个模型
Let me share with you this model that
是我根据这一领域大量研究建立起来的
I created based on a lot of research in the field.
它基本上解释了我们的信念及希望
That essentially tries to explain how our beliefs,
是如何影响我们的表现的
our expectations impact our performance.
无论是安慰剂效应
Whether it's through the placebo drug,
还是我们学习 体育运动 恋爱关系等
whether it's our performance in school,in sports,
生活各个方面的表现
in relationships,in every area in our lives.
换句话说 这盒子里是什么
In other words,what comes in the box here?
这上面应该有哪些内容?
Or in the...over here?
是什么斡旋于信念期望
What comes,what mediate between beliefs,
及实际表现之间?
expectations and actual performance in the real world?
我想谈谈两个机制
I want to talk about two mechanisms.
第一个相对简单易懂
The first one is very straight forward,
即动力
relatively simple,it's motivation.
如果我相信我能行
So,if I believe that I can do well,
各位可以回忆一下自己的经历
and think about your own past experiences,
当你相信你能做好某事时
when you believe that you could do well in something,
00:30:59,880 --&gt; 00:31:02,170
会非常有动力
you are much more likely to be motivated
如果你认为自己希望渺茫
than if you think that you are hopeless and have no chance,
那就很有可能就此放弃 无所作为
you are much more likely to resign and not do anything.
你不仅事前会受到激励
You are much more likely to be motivated before
无论是训练 还是练习
the event whatever the event may be,in training,in practice,
而且正式进行时也会动力十足
as well as during the event,while it's taking place.
想想Marva Collins的研究
Think about what Marva Collins did.
她激励学生
She motivated her students,
545
让他们相信他们能获得成功
she made them believe that they could achieve,
他们一生中能有所作为
that they could make something out of their lives
这是他们的责任
and that it's their responsibility that it was up to them,
这改变了他们的命运
and that made all the difference for them.
因为他们有了动力 所以非常刻苦
Because they were motivated,they worked hard.
所以动力非常重要
So motivation makes a difference.
除了动力外 另一样东西也会影响我们
There is another thing though,in addition to motivation,
即一致性或相合性的概念
and that is the notion of consistency or congruence.
那是什么意思
What dose that mean?
我们每个人对世界都存在心理图式
You see,we all have a mental schema of the world,
世界应该怎么样 会怎么样 是怎么样
a mental schema of the way the world should be,or to be or is.
比如 我的一个心理图式
For example,I have a mental schema
表明把东西放在半空会掉下来
that suggests that things fall when left in middle air.
所以我认为如果我放开这东西
So I have a schema that says that if I dropped this,
它就会掉下来
it would actually fall.
图式认为我的数学能力
I have a schema about my ability in mathematics
我可能是个优秀的数学家
that I might be a good mathematician,
我在这一领域是否有潜力
that I have potential in this area or not.
对其他人的态度也有图式 我喜欢这人
I also have the schema about other people. I like this person.
那人真好
That person is a nice person versus
还是那人不好 残忍
this person is just not nice,cruel.
566
所以我们对他人 对自己
So we have schemas about other people,
对自然现象 都有图式
about ourselves,about natural phenomenon.
图式就是内在
This is inside,the schema.
还有外部世界
And then,there is the outside world.
现实发生在外部世界
In the outside world,actual things take place.
比如 半空中我松开手 它就会掉下来
For example,when this is left in middle air,it falls.
这一事实与我的图式无关
This is,has nothing to do with my schema.
它发生在外部世界 不管我的图式如何
It's outside. It happens regardless of my schema.
我在数学上的实际潜力
Now I have certain potential
也与我的图式无关
in mathematics regardless of my schema.
某个人对他人
A certain person behaves generously and benevolently
是慷慨仁慈还是可憎无礼
toward other people or in a hateful manner
也与我的图式无关
toward other people regardless of my schema.
所以内部和外部两个因素
So there is what's inside and what is outside,
共同作用就是关键
and here is the key point.
我们的精神不喜欢内部与外部
You see,the mind dose not like when there is a discrepancy
存在差异
between what is inside and what is outside.
我们的精神喜欢两者一致相合
The mind likes when there is consistency,
如果不相合
congruence between the two,and if there is no congruence,
如果不一致
if there is no consistency,
我们就会产生异议感
then we experience a sense of dissidence,
觉得不适
then we experience disease.
感觉不舒服 不对劲
Doesn't feel good,doesn't feel right and we do,very often,
所以我们常常不惜一切 让两者统一
everything that we can to get the two on par again.
要么改变外部现实
Either by changing the external reality
要么改变自我思维以符合外部现实
or by changing our mind to match the external reality.
我们不喜欢不一致
We don't like when there is inconsistency.
有好几种方法
There are a few ways in which
可以重建一致性
we can create this consistency again.
我给大家介绍几个
Let me share with you just some of them,
我会讲4个 都是互相关联的
and I'm gonna share four. They are interconnected.
互相联系 还有重合之处
There is relationship between. there is overlap,
但这样能帮助你们就此进行思考
but just so it helps you to think about it.
帮助你们理解内部与外部间
That helps you understand the dialogue that takes place
发生的对话
between what is inside or what is inside and what is outside.
两者差异发生时
So the first thing we can do when there is a discrepancy,
我们首先能做的就是更新图式
when there is inconsistency between the two is update schema.
这是第一种做法
This is the first thing we can do.
比如 原来我不知道松开手东西会掉下来
So,I didn't know things fell when left in middle air,
现在我知道了 于是我更新图式
now I know,I updated my schema.
又比如 我原来以为那人很可恶
Or,I thought that person was actually hateful,
但我看到他们对别人慷慨仁慈
but I just saw him behave generously and benevolently,
于是我更新图式 他是个好人
now I update my schema,he's a nice person.
第二种做法
The second thing that we do,
通常比第一种更普遍
which happens much more often than the first one,
即忽视或抛弃外在信息
is ignore or discard in external information.
忽视或抛弃
We ignore and discard external information
不符合图式的外部信息
that doesn't match our schema.
我们不喜欢不一致
We don't like this inconsistency,
于是直接扔掉这种不一致
we just throw this inconsistency out,
也就是忽视 抛弃它
so to speak,by ignoring it,discarding it.
00:35:37,010 --&gt; 00:35:38,780
第三种方法
The third thing we do,
主动验证
we actively seek confirmation.
我们会主动寻求验证信息
We actively seek confirmatory data.
想想2和3 想想现实世界
I mean,think about No.2 and 3,think about in the real
今年正是选举年
you know we are in the midst of election year.
想想你不会投谁的票
Think about the person you are not going to vote for,
或者你以前没投过谁
or the person you didn't vote for.
我们是怎么做的?通常 比如
What we do? Very often,let's say,
我看到布什总统做了件好事
I see President Bush doing something good,
为我信仰的某个事业奋斗
actually fighting for a cause that I believe in.
但我之前没给布什投票 举例而已
But I didn't vote Bush,for instance.
于是多数情况下 我会选择
Very often what I would do is ignore
忽视抛弃这条信息
and discard that information,
然后寻找有利证据以支持...
and then look for confirming evidence that will suggest...or that
坚定我讨厌布什的立场
will confirm to me why I don't like Bush in the first place.
这同样适用于今后的选举 比如希拉里或奥巴马
This same regarding,say the future elections,Hillary or Obama.
如果我不喜欢他们 我就会寻找相应证据
If I dislike them,I would look for confirming evidence
证明我为什么不喜欢他们
why I dislike them and even if they do things
即使他们做了什么我喜欢 重视或信仰的事
that I like and value and believe in,
通常我会选择忽视
I very often will ignore these things and discard them.
我们所做的 就是创造另一个现实
And what you are doing here,you are creating a reality
因为我们在质疑
because you are asking a question such as
布什做过什么恶
where has Bush done terrible things or
希拉里或奥巴马做过什么恶
where has Hillary or Obama did terrible things?
当我们问这些问题时
And when we ask these questions,
我们已经完全忽略抛弃正面的东西
we completely ignore,discard,not see the positives.
记得我问你们几何性质吗
Remember when I ask you about the geometric shapes?
你们没看见车上的孩子
You didn't see the children on the bus.
虽然他们就在你们眼前
Even though they were right there in front your very eyes.
所以质疑会创造现实
So we know that questions create reality,
而为了保持一致性
and in order to maintain this consistency,
我们常常会采取二者中的一种方法
we do very often one of these two things.
要么忽视抛弃 要么寻找有利证据
Either ignore and discard,or seek confirming evidence,
无论积极或消极 来支持我们的图式
positive or negative to back up our schema.
是希拉里 奥巴马好 还是布什好
Hillary,Obama is good or Bush is good
或是其他任何看法
or whatever it is that we are thinking about.
第4件事直接得多 即创造新的现实
The fourth thing is much more directly,creating a new reality.
1954年5月6日前的现实是什么
What kind of reality existed before the 6th of May,1954?
当时的现实是 4分钟
It was reality in which four minutes
是人类的极限 不可能突破
was the limit of human ability.
爱迪生做...抱歉 Bannister做了什么
And what did Edison do,sorry,what did Bannister do?
他说可能 于是改变了外在现实
He said it's possible and then he changed the external reality.
不仅是他自己 还有世界上其他赛跑者
Not just for himself,but also for other runners in the world.
突然间创造了新的现实
And suddenly a new reality was created.
起初的图式是4分钟不可能跑完
Initially the schema was four minutes is not possible,
或者说4分钟不可能跑完
or rather four minutes is not possible
而所有人都拥护这个图式
and everyone adhered to this schema.
Roger Bannister认为是可能的
Roger Bannister came and said,it is possible,
他改变了现实 不仅为自己
and changed that reality,not just for himself,
也为其他赛跑者
but for other runners who were there.
事实是 当干劲十足的人达成后
The thing though is,that after we perform with high motivation,
干劲没那么足的人可能也会寻求统一
low motivation might looking for consistency.
我们需要解读自己表现
All that is left us to do is interpret our performance.
成功还是不成功 好还是坏
Was it successful or not successful,and good or bad?
有两种解读方法
And there are two forms of interpretation.
一是客观解读
One is the objective interpretation,
我考试得了A还是C
did I just give A in an exam or did I get a C.
跑步我是第三名还是最后一名
Did I just come third or did I come last in their race.
周五与普林斯顿大学的冰球赛
Did I just be Princeton in hockey on Friday?
是赢了还是输了?哈佛加油 到底发生了什么?
Or did I lose to Princeton? Go Harvard. So what happen?
这就是现实 客观
This is the reality. It's objective,its objective. But then,
但同时 还有由信仰决定的主观解读
there is also the subjective interpretation based on my beliefs.
举个例子
Let me share an example with you...
有个关于托马斯.爱迪生的故事
This is a story told about Thomas Edison.
爱迪生于1870年代
Thomas Edison,back in the 1870's,
与科学界都在研究灯泡
was working along with the rest of the scientific community
如何用电发光
on the light bulb,on generating light from electricity.
整个科学界都在研究这一课题
The entire scientific community or much of it was working
但一无所获
on that,on that issue,with no success,
爱迪生也不例外
Thomas Edison being no exception.
当地报纸的一名记者
A journalist from one of the local papers
前去采访爱迪生
came to Thomas Edison to interview.
他当时已经非常有名了 发明了很多东西
He was already famous by then,he invented many things.
他们谈了各种话题
And they were talking about various things
然后开始讲灯泡问题
and then they got to talk about the light bulb.
那个记者对爱迪生说 "爱迪生先生"
And the journalist said to Edison,"Mr. Edison,
您致力于灯泡研究许多年了
you've been working on the light bulb for many years.
整个科学界都在进行相同研究
The rest of the scientific community has been working on it,
但毫无所获"
to no avail."
当时爱迪生已经进行了5000次实验
Now at that point Thomas Edison had conducted 5000 experiments,
这位记者也知道 于是他对爱迪生说
so,and the journalist knew that so he told Edison,
"爱迪生先生 您已经进行了5000次实验
"Mr. Edison,you've conducted 5000 experiments,
失败了5000次 放弃吧"
and you failed 5000 times. Give it up."
你们可能知道 爱迪生听力不好
Now Thomas Edison,some of you may know was also hard
事实上 他有一项专利就是助听器
of hearing,in fact one of his patents was a hearing aid.
所以他对记者说"你说什么
So he said to the journalist," Excuse me,what did you say?"
那个记者重复"我说你失败了5000次
The journalist said,"well,I said you failed 5000 times,
放弃吧" 爱迪生回答"我没有失败5000次
give it up." So Edison responded,"I didn't fail 5000 times.
是成功了5000次
I succeeded 5000 times.
我成功证明了哪些方法行不通"
I succeeded in showing what doesn't work."
同样的客观现实 表现 5000次失败
Same objective reality,performance,5000 failed experiments,
但却有完全不同的解读
but very different interpretation.
那个记者也其他科学界认定
The journalist and many other people
这是不可能达成的
in the scientific community conclude its not possible,
但爱迪生的主观解读
the interpretation,subjective interpretation of Edison it's just
却是他走向成功的敲门砖 因为是可能的
another stepping stone towards success because it is possible.
事实是 爱迪生在发明灯泡前就宣布
In fact,Edison declared,before he had the light bulb,
他将在1879年12月31日
that on the 31st of December,1879,
展示灯泡
he would display the light bulb.
这是在他发明灯泡前
That was long before he had done it.
1879年12月31日 爱迪生向世界展示了
On the 31st of December,1879,Edison displayed to the world,
用电发光
generating light from electricity.
同样地 1962年 肯尼迪总统说
Just like in 1962,John F. Kennedy said that there would be a man
60年代末人类将踏上月球
on the moon by the end of the decade.
那时我们连登月的物质条件...
And there was before we had the materials necessary for doing it,
科学技术都还不具备
before we had other technology necessary for doing it.
他向全世界放话说
He threw his knapsack over the world
人类能踏上月球 然后创造了现实
and said it's possible to do it. And that created a reality.
这与大量的辛勤工作是分不开的
That was coupled with a lot of hard work.
事实上 爱迪生失败了不止5000次
Edison in fact failed more that 5000 more times
才最终发明了灯泡
before he actually created the light bulb.
他不是干坐在实验室说
It wasn't just sitting his room and saying,
"相信就能做到"
"I believe therefore I will achieve."
而是我相信 而且我会加倍努力
It was I believe and I will work even harder now,
满怀斗志地工作
with more motivation and so on.
他的一条名言是"我从失败走向成功"
One of his mantras,"I failed my way to success."
爱迪生是史上最富创造力最多产的科学家
It is no coincidence that Edison,by far the most creative
这并不是巧合
and productive scientific genius of all time.
他一生申请了1097项专利
he patented 1097 patents in his career.
当今世界的发展 大半要归功于他
Much of our world looks the way it looks,
00:43:45,990 --&gt; 00:43:52,290
史上最成功最富创造力的科学家
thanks to him. No coincidence,but the most successful,
也是失败次数最多的科学家
creative scientist in history is also,as far as we know,
这并不是巧合
the scientist who had failed the most times.
还有Dean Simonton的研究
Research by Dean Simonton,we'll talk about it more depth
等我们谈到完美主义时会精讲
when we talked about perfectionism.
Dean Simonton的研究证明
Research by Dean Simonton shows that
史上最成功的科学家与艺术家
the most successful scientists and artists through our history
也是失败次数最多的
were also the ones who failed the most times.
"Babe"Ruth是职业生涯中全垒打次数最多的球手
No coincidence that "Babe" Ruth,who hit during many of the years
他也是三振出局最多的
when he played the most homeruns,also hit the most strike outs.
其中有5个赛季 三振出局次数最多
In five of these seasons,was strike out the most times rather.
史上最成功的人往往是
The most successful people in history are also very often,
失败次数最多的
the people who had failed the most times.
这一句话我会反复在课堂上重复
This is a sentence that I'll repeat it over and over again
学会失败 从失败中学习
in the class and here it is: learn to fail,or fail to learn.
学会失败 从失败中学习
Learn to fail,or fail to learn,
成功别无他法
there is no other way to succeed.
学习如何工作别无他法
There is no other way to learn,in terms of how to work,
要学习如何在科学 政治或艺术界
and there is no other way to learn in terms of learning
取得成功 别无他法
how to succeed as scientist,or as a politician,or as an artist.
正如Dean Simonton指出的那样 纵观历史
The artists,as Dean Simonton showed,who had the most dubs,
那些有过最多次挫折 最多次失败尝试的艺术家
the most failed attempts through out history were also
也是最终看来最成功的艺术家
the artists who were the most successful in the long run.
成功没有捷径
No short cuts.
只是坐下来思考
It's not enough to just sit down and think,
构想和相信是不够的
and conceive and believe.
我们要做的比这多得多
We need to do much more than that.
Martin Seligman 他被认为是积极心理学之父
Martin Seligman,considered father of positive psychology,
做了一些有关乐观主义和悲观主义的研究
has done a lot of work on optimism and pessimism.
他发现
And here is what he found.
他发现 就目标设定而言
What he found was that when it comes to goal setting,
悲观主义者不论在他们的短期目标
pessimists are realistic in terms of their short term goals
还是长期目标上都很现实
as well as in terms of their long term goals.
现实是好事
That's good thing to be a realistic.
短期目标和长期目标都很现实
Short term goal as well as long term goal realistic.
而乐观主义者很现实 抱歉 乐观主义者与之相反
Where as optimists are realistic,sorry,optimists on the other
在他们的短期目标设定上并不现实
hand,are unrealistic when it comes to their short term goals,
但对于他们的长期目标就很现实
but are realistic when it comes to their long term goals.
这是怎么回事? 让我们再来看这个模型
Why is that? Well,let's look at the model again.
我们先来看悲观主义者
So let's take the pessimists first.
他们有某个目标 他们的期望低
They have certain goal,and they have low expectations,
信念不高 他们不认为自己能做好
low levels of beliefs,they don't think they would do well.
积极性低 他们的大脑寻求一致
Low levels of motivation,their mind looks for consistency,
他们的表现通常取决于
and their performance is usually according to
他们的信念和期望
their beliefs and expectations.
他们的理解是 我早跟你说了
And the interpretation is,I told you so.
我早就跟你说了我做不好
I told you I couldn't do well here.
于是其他人都异口同声说是的 你早就跟我们说了
And then everyone else in a chorus says,yes,you told us so.
你这样现实真是好啊
How wonderfully realistic of you.
但有时悲观主义者超出了自身的期望
But then sometimes a pessimist succeeds
取得了成功
beyond his or her expectations.
那么又会怎么样呢?
And then what happens?
这时的解释是 低水平的信念
The interpretation is,low levels of beliefs,
那么解释就是 只是走运而已
so the interpretation is,well,it was lucky,
是因为火星转到了金星的前面
it was because Mars was in front of Venus,
50年难得一遇 不会再发生了
and that only happens once every 50 years,won't happen again.
或者 今天是我的幸运日 或者是因为她今天表现得不好
Or,it was my lucky day,or,she just played very poorly today.
于是 大脑在寻求一致
And then,the mind looking for consistency,
一次又一次地重复这个循环
they go around that loop again and again,
然后再一次变得现实
and then become realistic once more.
不成功的现实 但是现实
Unsuccessfully realistic,but realistic.
于是他们在短期目标上
So they're realistic in the short term
同样也在长期目标上很现实
as well as in the long term.
我们现在来看乐观主义者
Let's look at the optimist now.
乐观主义者一开始有着很高的信念
The optimist starts with high levels of beliefs,
很高的期望 积极性 非常高
high levels of expectations,motivation,incredibly high.
他们的大脑寻求一致性 表现 没那么好
The mind looking for consistency,performance,not so good,
没期望中的那么好
not as good as the expectations were.
换言之就是 不现实
In other words,unrealistic.
但是 由于信念水平很高 他们的解释
However,the interpretation,because of high levels of beliefs,
其主观的解释是
the subjective interpretation is,
好吧 如果我从中吸取教训了会怎么样? 这是个机会
OK,so,what if I learn from it? This is an opportunity;
我这次其实做得有进步了 就当吸取教训了
I've actually got better this time. What if I learn?
他们依然保持着很高的信念
And they still have high levels of beliefs
很高的期望
and high levels of expectations.
积极性很高 大脑寻求积极性
Motivation is high,the mind looks for consistency,
他们的表现依然不好
they perform,still not good,
没有他们所期望的那么好 不现实
not as good as they expected,unrealistic.
但解释依然是 如果我从中吸取教训了会怎么样?
But the interpretation,still,what if I learn from it?
我这次做得好多了
I've gone even better this time.
我指出了哪些方法是不可行的 然后他们继续
I've shown what doesn't work. And they continue.
但然后外界的声音就会争吵说
But then comes the quarrels from the outside and says,
"不是吧 真的么 你为什么就不能现实点
"come on,really,why can't you be realistic
像你的好兄弟或者好姐妹 悲观主义者那样"
like your good brother or sister,the pessimist."
但是他们相信他们能做到
But they believed that they can do it,
于是一次又一次地继续坚持 继续努力工作
and they continue to persist and to work hard again and again.
5次 10次 有时5000次 甚至10000次
5 times,10 times,sometimes 5000 even 10000 times,
久而久之 直到他们带来了"不现实的现实"并让它成真
until they bring the "unrealistic reality" and make it realistic
和他们的信念相一致了
to match their beliefs over time.
所以即使在短期看来 现实可能不一致
So even though in the short term,the reality may not match,
我可能接下来10年跑一英里
I may run the mile for the next 10 years in 4 minutes
都要4分12秒或者4分2秒
and 12 seconds or 4 minutes and 2 seconds.
但我终将到达目标 让我不现实的
But I'll get there eventually and make my unrealistic
"期望"和目标变成现实
"expectations" and goals realistic.
经历很多失败 经历很多努力付出
Through a lot of failure,through a lot of hard work,
经历很多坚持不懈
through a lot of persistence.
Seligman就乐观主义和悲观主义的内容所展现的
What Seligman shows about optimism and pessimism is not
并非只是某种遇事过分乐观的自我感觉良好
that it's not just some pollyannaish feel-good,
你知道 构想然后相信之类的方式
you know conceive and believe,kind of approach.
而是关于我们如何解释事件
Rather,it's about how we interpret events.
比如 我如何解释我的失败?
So for example,how do I interpret my failure?
最后的结论是 大惨败 放弃
As end of the story,catastrophe, give it up?
还是一个通向成功的机会?
Or as an opportunity for success?
所以他 我们下次课会谈到
So he distinguishes,and we'll talk about it more next time,
他把解释一件事分为是
he distinguishes between interpreting an event
永久的还是暂时的
as permanent or temporary.
我没发明电灯 那么这可能意味着
I just didn't create light from electricity,so that could mean,
这是不可能的 我永远也做不到 或者也可能意味着
well,it's not possible and I'll never do it or it could mean,
这是向成功的更进一步
well,this is another step towards success:
告诉我了什么是不可行的
showing what doesn't work.
我想要的一份工作被拒了
I've just being turned down from a job that I wanted,
这意味着我永远都找不到工作
well,it means I'll never find a job
或者这是个暂时的挫折 来看看我学到了什么
or that's a temporary setback. Let's see what I can learn.
来看看我怎么样能重新寻找并
Let's see how I can home my search and find,
最终找到我理想中的职位
eventually,my ideal position.
也要看人的态度是一概而论还是有针对性
It's also about being pervasive or specific.
悲观主义者认为事物是...
Pessimists look at things that's being...
他们一概以消极眼光看事情
the negatives,being pervasive.
我不是个好的科学家还是...
Well,I'm just not a good scientist versus...
我只是这一次的这个实验没做好
well,I just wasn't able to get this experiment right this time.
或者如果考试得了低分 我就是白痴
Or if I get a poor grade on an exam,I'm just stupid.
看什么都是一概而论 不是全部就是一无所有
Pervasive,everything,all or nothing.
而相反可以认为我只是具体这一次考试没考好
Versus I just didn't do well here on this specific exam.
我从中能吸取什么教训并且下次如何能考好
What can I learn from it and how can I do better next time.
这就是乐观主义和悲观主义 而这种态度可以习得
This is what optimism and pessimism is. And it can be learned.
很多有关这方面的研究...表明学习主观地
A lot of research in this area...showing how learning to interpret
像乐观主义者 解释事件可以获得更高层次的成功
events subjectively as optimists leads to much higher success.
你们中的而有些人可能知道Matt Biondi 1988年汉城奥运会
Some of you may recognize Matt Biondi. 1988 Seoul Olympics.
许多人都认为他能追平Mark Spitz
Many people thought that he could equal Mark Spitz
7块金牌的记录
records of seven gold medals.
第一场比赛 银牌 巨大的失望
First race,silver medal. Huge disappointment.
第二场比赛 铜牌 巨大的失望
Second race,bronze medal. Huge disappointment.
大家 我记得很清楚
Everyone I remembered that very distinctly.
人们谈论着他如何受到压力的影响
People talking about how he falls under pressure,
他不是我们所期望的那个人
how he is not the person we thought he is.
Martin Seligman在那时说"不 他将会成功"
Martin Seligman at that point said "no,he's going to succeed"
为什么? 因为他衡量过他和许多其他运动员
Why? Because he measured him and many other athletes
在乐观与悲观方面的水平
on their levels of optimism and pessimism.
Matt Biondi一直是个乐观主义者
And Matt Biondi was a constant optimist.
他知道他会将这些"失败"理解为 我指的是
And he knew he would interpret these "failures",I mean,you know
奥运会上的银牌和铜牌 算是失败 对吧?
bronze and silver medals in the Olympics,failures,right?
这些相对于他期望赢得7块金牌来说 是失败
But these relative for him expected to win seven golds,failures,
但他不会把它们视为永久性的失败
he would interpret them not as permanent.
把"我发挥失常 我不能在奥运会上实现目标"
"I choke. I can't make it in the Olympics"
视为 "我再也不能游好泳和赢比赛了"
as pervasive "I can't swim well anymore and win"
而只是视为暂时的和特定的失败 他也正是那么做的
to temporary and specific,which he did exactly that
并赢下了接下来的5块金牌
and won the next five gold medals.
这让很多人吃惊 但Seligman和他的研究小组没有
Surprising many people,not Seligman and his research team
他们非常清楚他的理解方式
who knew exactly what his interpretation style would be
屡"败"屡战
following these "failures".
这同样也和社会和身心健康有关
Also it associated with social and physical mental health.
比如我们的免疫系统 心理上和生理上的免疫系统
For example,our immune system,psychological and physical immune
因为乐观而实际上增强了
system is actually stronger as a result of being optimists.
适应力水平 Karen Reivich的很多研究表明
Resilience levels,a lot of research by Karen Reivich shows
如果你教人们积极地 乐观地理解事物
that if you teach people to interpret things positively,
他们就更有可能成功
optimistically,they are much more likely to succeed.
如果有谁有兴趣了解更多这方面的内容 看她的书
Those of you who are interested in more about this,her book,
《适应力因素》 Karen Reivich写的 很不错的书
The Resilience Factor,Karen Reivich,fantastic book,
她在书里讲到了一个为期
where she talks about programs implemented where within
几个星期的项目 孩子们此后两年都
a few weeks kids are immune to the experience of depression
对忧郁的经历免疫
two years hence...
那些学习如何乐观的人
People who learn to be optimistic and she teaches them
她在短短两周时间里对他们进行指导
in a short period as two weeks compare that
00:54:00,920 --&gt; 00:54:04,320
并和剑桥Summerville五年的研究做对比
to the five years of the Cambridge Summerville Study.
在短短两周时间里 那些被教导
Within as little as two weeks,people who were
乐观地理解事物的人变得更快乐
taught optimistic interpretation style become happier,
学过的人患上忧郁的可能性
those who learn it are eight times less likely
减小了八倍
to experience depression.
有忧郁经历的可能性减小了八倍
Eight times less likely to experience depression,
只是简单地学习一种不同的理解方式
if you simply learn a different interpretation style.
我没有失败5000次
I haven't failed 5000 times;
我成功地发现了什么是不可行的
I've succeeded in showing what doesn't work.
所以如果我这次没做好
So what if I didn't do well now,
我下次或者下下次会做得更好
I will do better next time or the time after that.
学会更积极地理解事物的人
People who learn to interpret things more positively
事实上活得更长
actually live longer.
我们将会谈到一些这方面的研究
And we'll talk about some of this research.
你会读到一些这方面的内容 修女研究等等
You'll read about a bit of it,the Nun Study and so on.
积极地理解事物或者更乐观的人
People who interpret things positively
事实上活得更长
or more optimistic actually live longer.
那并不是说所有的悲观主义者都短寿
Now that does not mean that all pessimists die young
而所有的乐观主义者都长寿
and all optimists die old.
那只是这个等式里的因素之一
That's just one of the factors that goes into the equation,
还有其他的因素
there's many other things.
你知道 也有不现实的乐观主义
You know,you don't want,there is also unrealistic optimism
我们稍后会谈到
that we'll talked about it in a minute.
你知道 一个乐观主义者说
You know a person is optimist and says,
"无论如何 我会活到120岁"他有吸烟的习惯
"I'll live to 120 no matter what"and smokes,you know,
但一天抽120支烟很可能活不到120岁
120 cigarettes a day would probably not live to 120.
所以这不只是只是信念 还有很多因素
So it's not just about the belief,but a lot of it is.
最后 正如我屡次提到的 它是可以习得的
And finally,as I mentioned time and again,it can be learned,
我们将讨论要如何学习它 我们能怎么学
and we'll talk about how it can be learned and how we can learn,
而在你的课后论文里 你们将研究这个问题
and you'll do it whether it's in your response paper,
不是这周的 是下周的论文
not for this week,but for the next week,
或者是通过分组作业 或者独自完成
as well as in sections,as well as by yourselves.
一种能被习得
A technique that can be learned
并有所有这些积极效应的方法
and can have all these positive effects.
好吧
Okay.
但是有一个问题
There's a problem here though.
我要如何区分这两者
You know,how do I distinguish between this
现实的乐观主义和不现实的乐观主义
and realistic optimism and unrealistic optimism.
用盲目乐观主义做例子
Detached optimism that is advocated in for example
对于自助运动而言
for self-help movement.
是不是所有我认为我能实现的
Is everything that I think of I achieve
我构想的都能变成现实?
and conceive and becomes a reality?
我的自我概念是否我的且是我唯一的命运?
Is my self-concept my destiny and my only destiny?
或是否存在所谓的不现实信念?
Or is there such a thing as unrealistic beliefs?
确实存在这样一个东西
And there is such a thing as unrealistic beliefs.
下面是个例子
Here is an example.
她的叫Rena 是个歌舞女郎 至少对我来说她是
Her name was Rena,she was a showgirl,at least to me,she was.
Rena和我有很多共同点
Rena and I had a great deal in common.
我们都十几岁 我12岁 她14岁
We were both in our teens, I was twelve. She was fourteen.
我们都5英尺高
We both were in our fives.
她5英尺6英寸 我5英尺1英寸 我爱上了Rena
She was 5'6. I was 5'1. I was in love with Rena.
Rena也爱她自己
Rena too was in love with herself.
现在 只是做个边注 我有一个很棒的妈妈
Now,just as a side note,I have a wonderful mother,
很好的妈妈 她相信我
and amazing mother who believes in me.
而事实上当我们三个
And in fact when the three of us.
我们三兄妹放学回家时
We were three brothers and sisters would come home from school.
我们经常会跟妈妈讲学校里
We would very often talked to our mom about everything
发生的所有事 好事还有坏事
that was going on in school,good and bad.
我有一天回家 意识到我是真心地 疯狂地
So I came home after I realized that I was truly and madly
爱上Rena 她就是我的真命天女
in love with Rena and that she was the one for me.
我回到家 告诉了我妈妈
I came home and talked to my mom about it.
我告诉她 "妈妈 我那么地爱她"
And I told her,"Mom,I love her so."
于是她说 "那问题是什么?"
So she said," what's the problem?"
我就跟她解释了她比我大
And I explained to her that she was older that I was
学校里的那些大男生也对她有兴趣
and all the big boys in the school were interested in her,
她比我高多了
that she was much taller than I was.
而我妈妈对我有信心 她采用了
And my mother believed in me and went on
自我应验预言的那一套
self-fulfilling prophecy campaign.
尽管她从没读过Napoleon Hill
And though she had never read Napoleon Hill,
她对我说 "Tal 只要你想得到
she said to me,"Tal,whatever you conceive,
只要你相信 你就能做到"
whatever you believe,you can achieve."
尽管她从没读过Branden 她对我说
And though she had never read Branden,she said to me,
"Tal 你的自我概念就是命运 而Rena就是你的命运"
"Tal,your self-concept is destiny. And Rena is your destiny."
她告诉我如果我真的真的认为我可以
And she told me that if I truly,truly believed that I could,
相信Rena会喜欢我 她就真的会喜欢我
that Rena would want me. She really would want me.
我妈妈激励了我 让我相信自己
And my mom inspired me and made me believe in myself.
于是我去接近Rena 我做好了准备
So I went ahead to approach Rena,and I prepared for it.
我认真做好了准备
I really prepared for it.
虽然我那时还没有刮胡子 但我喷了些须后水
Though I wasn't shaving at that time,I put on aftershave.
然后我继续行动
And I continued.
我可以做到 我知道我能
I can do it. I know I can.
我走进Rena 但这时音乐停止了
And I approach Rena,but then the music stopped.
00:59:57,190 --&gt; 01:00:00,
尽管我期望很高
And though I had very high expectations,
尽管我预想我能成功
and though I envisioned success.
我闭上眼睛 我看到自己成功了
I closed my eyes and I saw myself succeeding.
她没有兴趣 她不喜欢我
She was not interested. She didn't want me.
但是 但是 我们成为了很好的朋友
However,however,we became very good friends.
事实上我们关系那么好 她会跟我谈论
In fact so good that she would tell me about
她那些肤浅的高大的男朋友们
all her shallow and tall boyfriends.
当我妈妈告诉我她真的对我有信心
Now when my mom told me that she really believed in it,
她认为我是-- 她用意第绪语对我说
that she thought I was,you know that she told me this in Yiddish
她说(意第绪语)
and she said "foreign language"
在意第绪语里的意思是 "你是个大发现"
which means in Yiddish "you're a big find."
我真的 真的就是
I was really my,you know,really,
我那犹太母亲心中符合犹太教规的皮格马利翁
I was my Jewish mother's kosher Pygmalion.
好烂的比喻 我知道
So bad,yeah.
那句话花了我不少时间想出来的
You know,that took me a lot of time to think about,
你们最好表示一下喜欢它
you'd better appreciate it.
但是...谢谢 谢谢 但这没有用
But...thank you,thank you. But it didn't work.
再一次 别误解我 我非常感激我妈妈
And again,don't get me wrong,I'm very grateful to my mom.
简直就像是全天候的驻家Marva Collins
I literally had 24/7 Marva Collins in my house.
我是那么地感激我妈妈 但是 这一次
I owe so much to my mom. However,in this case,
这可能不是现实的信念
it probably was not the realistic belief.
那么什么是现实的?
So what is realistic?
我们如何区分什么是现实的 什么不是?
How do we identify what is realistic and what is not?
下面是一些对我们有帮助的想法
Here are some ideas to help us do so.
斯托克代尔悖论
The Stockdale paradox.
它认为要找出矛盾
It's about finding the tension,
让矛盾化解 这并不容易
reconciling the tension and it's not easy.
我不会给你们一个公式 告诉你们:
Again,I'm not going to give you a formula now to tell you:
好吧 就这样...算这个 如果是大于7的
OK,here is...calculate this,and if it's above seven,
就没有问题 低于7的 可能就不是这样
go ahead with green; below seven,probably not so.
不存在什么公式 但是 仅作为一个启发式
There is no formula. But here is,just a heuristic,
当你思考信念时 存在一些需要思考的东西
something to think about when you think about beliefs.
James Stockdale是名海军上将 他是
James Stockdale was admiral. James Stockdale was the highest
越南战争被俘人员里级别最高的战俘
ranking prisoner of war in the... in the Vietnam War.
他开始注意到一个现象 他在那关了很多年
And he started to notice a phenomenon. He was there for years.
最终被释放并得以活着向人们讲述往事 而其他许多战俘没能做到
Eventually got out and live to tell the tale many others did not.
他看到许多人幸存 许多人死亡
And he saw many people survive,many people not survive.
战俘的生存条件非常恶劣
The very harsh conditions of the prisoner.
他发现那些活下来的人有两个特点
What he was that the people who survived had two characteristics.
第一个 他们相信他们能出去
First of all,they believed that they would get out,
他们坚信终有一天他们会重获自由
they had faith that one day they would be free.
他们会再见到自己的家人 朋友
They would get to see their family,their friends.
这种信念支持着他们走下去
And this faith kept them going.
同时 也就是第二个特点
At the same time,and this is the second component,
他们有着现实的信念 能对情况做出估计
they had realistic beliefs and evaluation of the situation.
如果这两点有一点没做到
If any one of these two components were missing,
他们就不大可能活下来
they were unlikely to survive.
如果他们没有信念 他们不相信他们会活下来
If they didn't have faith and they didn't believed it they would
他们很可能在恶劣的环境下死去
survive,they were very likely to die in the harsh conditions.
另一方面 如果他们认为
On the other hand,if they thought that
他们能在这年的圣诞节之前就出去
they would get out by this coming Christmas,and really
并真的相信他们能在这年的圣诞节之前离开
believed that they would get out by this coming Christmas,
他们同样也不大可能幸存
they were also less likely to survive.
因为他们这年的圣诞节没有被放出去
Because they didn't get out by this coming Christmas,
他们失望 气馁 无助
and then they were desponded,resigned,helpless,
通常情况下 他们会死去
and very often,they died.
所以关键是这两点 相信你会出去
So it was the two components,believe that you would get out,
但同时明白自己需要
but at the same time know that you need to
01:03:47,910 --&gt; 01:03:50,530
应对现实 残酷的现实
deal with reality and that it's tough.
James Stockdale如是说
Here is what James Stockdale said,
"你不能把坚信自己最终会在
"you must never confuse faith that you would prevail in the end
输不起的情形下取得胜利的信念
which you can never afford to lose
同直面现有残酷现实的行为
with the discipline to confront the most brutal facts
相混淆 无论是何种残酷现实
of your current reality whatever they might be."
现实的乐观主义
Realistic optimism.
现在的问题是你可能有时会错
Now the thing is that you may be wrong at times.
有时你可能真的相信什么
And sometimes you may really believe in something,
相信你有现实的期望
and believe it that you have realistic expectations
但没有成功
and not succeed.
但就像我们谈到的那样...我们接下来会谈到
But as we talked about...And as we'll talk about in a few minutes,
这也没太大关系
it doesn't matter that much.
因为即使没有成功 我们能很快恢复动力
Because even if we don't success we just bounce back up.
继续努力工作
And continue working hard.
而关键就是尽可能地保持平衡
The key though is as much as possible,to attain this balance.
这就是Maslow所说的高水平信念
What Maslow calls The Graceful Integration
和与现实联系间的完美整合
between high level of beliefs and connection to reality.
这个不是答案
No prescription here.
只是一个启发 让你们记在脑子里
But just a heuristic,something to keep in mind.
积极的思考不是秘密本身
Positive thinking is not THE secret.
是的 它是这个秘密的一部分
Yes,it's part of the secret.
是的 它是成功公式的一部分
Yes,it's part of the success formula.
是的 它是幸福公式的一部分 但并非全部
Yes,it's part of the happiness formula. But it's not all.
错误的乐观主义迟早意味着幻灭
False optimism sooner or later means disillusionment,
愤怒和无望
anger and hopelessness.
成功的秘密是
Here is the secret of success.
这是一个经研究证实的秘密
This is the secret proven by research.
多年对不同文化 不同地方
Thousand of years of research and successful people
不同年龄的成功人士的研究
in different cultures,in different places and in different ages.
这个秘密是乐观 热情和勤奋
It's optimism,passion and hard work.
纵观历史 你很难找到哪个成功人士
It'll be very hard for you to find successful men and women
是不具备这三个品质的
through out history who did not have all three.
乐观 信念 坚信他们能做好
Optimism,belief,faith that they can do well,
坚信他们能成功
that they can succeed.
热情 热爱他们从事的事业 并且勤奋工作
Passion,love for what they were doing. And hard work.
正如爱迪生所说 没有什么能代替勤奋
There is no substitute for hard work as Edison said.
这三个要素 就是这个秘密...很简单 很明确
These 3 components. The secret...simple,straighforward.
你们都知道 还记得我第2次课上说的么
You know it all. Remember what I said during 2nd class.
我不会教你们新的知识
I'm not going to teach you much new.
我希望使你们想起你们已经知道的知识
I hope to remind you what you already know.
乐观 热情和勤奋
Optimism,passion and hard work.
那运气是否也有作用呢? 当然了
Does luck play a role? Absolutely.
Jefferson说"我非常相信运气
Jefferson,"I am a great believer in luck,
我发现我越努力工作 我的运气就越好"
and I find that the harder I work,the luckier I get."
运气背后实则也有科学奥妙
There is actually science behind luck.
你们会在《幸运要素》里读到
And you'll read about it in the Luck Factor.
在书中 拥有这三要素的人
Where people who have these 3 components,
相信自己能成功的人
who believe they can do well,
热爱自己的工作并勤奋努力的人
who love what they do and work hard,
事实上获得了更多的运气
actually find more luck.
用梭罗的话说就是不经意间有了更多的运气
In the words of Thoreau in Common Hours.
好的 那么为什么不是所有的家长都
Okay,so why don't all the parents
教我们要有高的期望呢?
teach us to have high expectations?
如果这对我们来说有好处 如果这和成功有关
If it's so good for us,if it's related to success,
和幸福 和身体健康有关的话
to happiness,to physical well-being,
为什么不是所有家长都对我们说不管你们做什么
why don't all our parents just say to us whatever we work,
你都能成功 你都做到
you can succeed,you can do it.
如果你梦想 你就能做到
If you dream about it,you can do it.
为什么父母和其他关心我们的人
Why did very often parents and people
常常要降低我们的期望呢?
who care about us lower our expectations?
因为他们关心我们的快乐水平
Because they are concerned about our happiness.
他们关心我们的自尊
They are concerned about our self esteem.
有很多种信念...人们相信
You see,there is a lot of belief...People believe that
高期望自然地会导致失望
high expectations naturally lead to disappointment.
所以...高期望导致失望
So...high expectations lead to disappointment.
这听起来是对的 这就是
And it sounds right. I mean,this is the formula that
William James在19世纪写下的公式
was written in the 19th century by William James.
他说自尊等于我们的成功
He said that self-esteem is equal to
除以抱负 换言之就是 我们的成就...
our success over pretensions. In other words,our achievement...
我们有多成功 我们取得了多少除以
how much we succeed,how much we achieve over
我们假装或期望所能取得的 我们的目标
what we pretend or what we aspire to,what our goals are.
换言之 如果我们有很高的期望 很高的抱负
In other words,if we have high expectations,high pretensions,
我们就有更大的可能伤害自己的自尊
we are much more likely to hurt our self-esteem.
例如 比如说我的渴求 我的抱负
For example,let's say my aspiration,my pretension,
我的期望是一个月挣4千美元
my expectation is to make 4 thousand dollars a month.
重申一下...我只是举了个数字化的
Again this...I just throw in a numeric
例子 这样便于理解
example here because it's easier to understand.
让我们假设我的希望是一个月挣4000美元
Let's say my hope is to make 4 thousand dollars a month.
那是我的抱负
That's my pretension.
但实际上结果我一个月挣到了2000美元
But in fact what I end up making is 2 thousand dollars a month.
根据William James的公式 我的自尊
According to William James' formula,my self-esteem,
而我们都知道自尊和快乐
and as we know self-esteem and happiness
是紧密相关的
are very highly co-related and related.
我的自尊 我的快乐水平
My self-esteem,my happiness level
根据这个公式便只有一半
according to this formula is a half.
另一方面 假设我的抱负
On the other hand,let's say my pretensions,
我的期望是一个月挣1500美元
my expectation is to make 1.5 thousand dollars a month
而事实上我一个月挣了1500美元
and in fact I make 1.5 thousand dollars a month.
根据这个公式 我的自尊
According to this formula,my self-esteem,
我的快乐水平是
my happiness level is 1.
尽管我挣的更少了
So here even though I'm making less,
我这里举的是数字化的例子
again I'm using a numeric example here,
你们可以想想其他例子
you can think about other examples.
尽管我实际上挣得少了
Even though I'm actually making less here,
我的自尊和我的快乐程度却变高了
my self-esteem and my happiness are higher.
所以要降低你的期望
So lower you expectations.
其实不尽然
Not so.
过去35年的研究发现
What was found in the last 35 years of research
这个公式实际上是错的
is that this formula is actually wrong.
情况不是这样的
That's not the case.
这才是实际的情况
Here is how it actually works.
让我们画一张图 横坐标是时间
Let's say we have a graph. And this is time.
纵坐标是我的自尊水平和快乐水平
And here is my self esteem levels and happiness levels.
让我们从我的基础水平开始 就在这里
And let's at start off around my base level which is here.
然后我参加了积极心理学的期中考试
And then I had a mid-term in Positive Psych.
我考得没有我期望的好
And I don't do as well as I expected to.
我的自尊会发生什么变化? 我的幸福会发生什么变化?
What happens to my self-esteem? What happens to my happiness?
当然它会下降 这很自然
Of course it'll go down. It's natural
我们都想成功或者说大多数人想成功
we all want to succeed or most people want to succeed.
所以如果低于我的期望它就下降了
So it goes down if it's below my expectations
但很快 如Daniel Gilbert
but very quickly as the research by Daniel Gilbert
有关有效预测的研究表明...
shows on effective forecasting...
很快我们又回到我们的基础快乐水平
very quickly we go back up to our base level of happiness.
接着一个星期后 我又考了 比如说55号数学课的期中考试
And then a week later I have another mid-term in say,maths 55.
我考得很好 比我期望的成绩还要高
And I ace it. I get much higher grade than I expected.
01:11:40,720 --&gt; 01:11:43,540
我的自尊和快乐曲线又会怎么变化? 它上升了
And what happens to my self-esteem and happiness? It goes up.
但然后很快它又降下来
But then very quickly it goes back down again.
然后我们假设我是12岁 我在街上走
And then let's say I'm 12 years old and I walk down
我遇到了Rena 我约她出来玩
the street and I meet Rena and I ask her out.
她拒绝了
And she says no.
我的自尊和快乐水平会发生什么变化?
What happens to my to my self-esteem and happiness?
它下降了 轻微地
It goes down. Slightly.
然后很快它又重新上升
And then very quickly it goes back up again.
然后我很幸运 我走在街上
And then lucky me. I walk down the street.
我以为我看到了Rena 但她有些不同
I think I see Rena but there is something different about her.
原来是她的孪生妹妹
And it turns out she has a twin sister.
我约她出去 她拒绝了
And I ask her out. And she says no.
再一次 发生了什么变化? 轻微地下降
And what happens once again? Slightly down.
但然后我恢复了 又再次上升
But then I recover and go back up again.
你们是不会相信的 她们是三胞胎
And you won't believe it. They are identical triplets.
我碰到了老三 她答应了
And I meet the 3rd sister and she says yes.
她说我也爱你
She says I love you too.
我的自尊和快乐水平发生了什么变化?
And what happens to my to my self-esteem and happiness?
它轻微地上升 对吧? 甚至高出了黑板
It goes up slightly right? Even taller than this.
但然后很快又下降回基础水平
But then very quickly back down to base level
如此反复 生活中的悲欢离合
and so on and so on. The vicissitudes of life...
不管我是得到了终身职位还是没得到
whether I get tenured or not tenured,
不管我买彩票是中奖了还是输钱了
whether I win the lottery or lose money.
在幸福的一个基础水平上下起起伏伏
The ups and downs around a base level of well-being.
现在有个好消息也有个坏消息
Now there is good news here and there is bad news here.
好消息是我能承担更大的风险
The good news is I can take more risks.
她拒绝我不是世界末日
It's not the end of world if she says no.
我失败了或者没能得到理想的工作
It's not the end of the world if I fail here
也不是世界末日
or if I don't get my dream job.
没有关系 我会恢复 我们都会 所以这是好消息
It's okay. I'll recover. We all do. So that's the good news.
坏消息是...我就卡在这了?
The bad news is...so I'm stuck?
我根据我的基因生来就是这个基础水平
So I was born with this base level according to my genes
并且不能提高吗?
and I can't really improve?
我如何提高这个快乐的基础水平?
How do I raise this base level of happiness?
这是可能的 我们会讲到...
And it's possible. And we'll talk about...
整个课程就是关于如何提高快乐的基础水平
the whole course is about raising the base level of happiness.
但这有一个发现
But here is one finding
是从专门针对自尊的研究中得来的
from specifically the research on self-esteem.
你下课之后马上能做的一个实验
On one thing you can do right now when you get out of class
来提高自尊 就是去面对而非逃避
to raise self-esteem and that is to cope as opposed to avoid.
去面对意味着把自己置身于风险线上
To cope meaning to put yourself on the line.
不是要你在恐慌时冒险
To take risks not when you're in your panic zone
而是在你放松时放手一搏
but when you're in your stretch zone.
去承担失败的风险 去解决 去处理
To risk failure. To handle things,to deal things,
去面对那些对你来说重要的事情
to confront things that are important to you.
参加戏剧试演 讨论时说出未曾表述出的观点
To try out for that play. To speak out in session if you haven't.
去你十分想去
To go out to a place where you really want to go
却从没去过的地方 去尝试
but never really try. To try.
因为那些经常面对问题的人有着同样
Because people who cope overtime have the same
或者有时频繁的起起伏伏
or sometimes more ups and downs.
但他们的起伏线条是这样的
But their ups and downs look like this.
依旧是起起伏伏 和普通人一样
Still ups and downs. Permission to be human.
但基础水平提高了
But the base level increases.
为什么基础水平提高了? 我将以此结束本节课
Why does the base level increase? I'm gonna end here.
为什么当我们不是逃避而是面对时
Why does the base level increase when we cope rather than avoid?
基础水平提高了? 三个原因
For 3 reason.
首先是自我知觉理论 Daryl Bem...
First self perception theory. Daryl Bem...
我不记得他是达特茅斯学院还是康奈尔大学的了
I think from either Dartmouth or Cornell...
Daryl Bem指出我们得出关于自己的结论
what Daryl Bem showed was that we derived conclusion
和我们得出关于他人的结论的
about ourselves in the same way
方式是一样的
that we derived conclusion about others.
比如说看到一个人走到大家面前
So for example if I see a person going up to people
发起谈话或者在会上发言
and initiating a conversation or speaking up in session
或者去参加一出戏的试演并一次又一次地尝试
or trying out for a play and trying again and again.
我关于这个人的结论就是这人很有勇气
My conclusion about this person is this person is courageous.
这人肯定有很高的自尊
This person must have high self-esteem.
我可能也是用同样的方式
And I may derive the conclusion about myself
推出关于自己的结论
in exactly the same way.
通过观察自己某些方式的行为
By seeing myself behaving a certain way,
我会得到关于自己自尊或者
I reach a conclusion about my self-esteem
仁慈或者慷慨或者其他方面的结论
or benevolence or generosity or whatever it is.
自我知觉理论 如果我面对了 我尝试了
Self perception theory. And if I cope,if I try things out
那我就认为这是一个有勇气的人
then I see that this is a person with courage.
这是一个敢于尝试的人
This is a person who tries. And my conclusion
得到关于自己的结论就是我肯定有很高的自尊
about myself would be I must have high self-esteem.
我的自尊还有幸福水平
And my self-esteem as well as happiness level
久而久之就会上升
overtime will actually increase.
自我知觉理论
Self perception theory.
我们得出关于自己的结论
We derive conclusion about ourselves
和我们得出关于他人的结论的方式是一样的
in the same way we derive conclusion about others.
就是通过观察行为
Meaning by looking at behavior.
我们在面对失败后会意识到
When we fail after coping we realize that the actual pain
真正来自于失败的痛苦远小于我们想象的
that comes with failure is far less than the pain we imagine
我们认为与失败有关的痛苦
and that we associate with failure.
我克服失败 是的 我是没做好
I just got over it. Okay,so I didn't do well in here
或者她是拒绝了我 但我克服了
or she said no. but I got over it.
但我一直在想的话 我就会认为它将一直持续
Whereas I imagine it in my mind I think it'll last forever.
正如那些终身职位或者非终身职位的教授
Just like those tenured or not tenured professors thought
以为他们的薪水将永远不变 其实并非如此
that their pay will last forever whereas it goes away.
所以当我意识到实际上的痛苦
So when I realize the pain of actual failure is far
比和失败有关的痛苦远远要小时
less than the pain associated with failure,
我变得更自信了 我能应付了
I become more confident. I can handle it.
我实际上比自己想象中要更有适应力
I'm actually much more resilient than I thought I was.
我的自尊水平上升了
And my self-esteem increases.
我的快乐水平也随之升高
My happiness as a result increases too.
最后还有更多的成功
And finally there is more success
因为成功别无二法
because there is no other way to succeed.
学习走路没有别的方法
There is no other way in terms of learning how to walk.
在艺术上或科学上或商业上或政治上
There is no other way in terms of succeeding in art
取得成功没有别的方法
or in science or in business or in politics.
学习失败 从失败中学习 我们星期四再见
Learn to fail or fail to learn. I'll see you on Thursday.
