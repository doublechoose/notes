幸福课 中英字幕 [第6课]乐观主义
希望各位度过了个愉快的周末Hope you had a wonderful long weekend.好了 直入主题So,let's jump right into it.上回说到哪儿了So where did we leave last time?上回我们谈了环境的力量Last time we talked about the power of the situation,谈到了信念是如何成为自我实现的预言we talk about how beliefs become self -fulfilling prophesies.以及我们是如何通过环境And how it is through the situation对他人产生期望及信念that we very often create expectations,believes of people.这些信念会变成现实And these believes become reality.还谈到了为什么说社会心理学本质上是从And we talked about how social psychology essentially started某些重要的实验开始的 比如米尔格伦实验with some very important experiment such as the Milgrim effect,又称权利服从研究or obedience to authority.比如津巴多的监狱实验Such as Zimbardo's prison experiment,试验中 囚犯被关在...where prisoners were put in or played...学生扮演囚犯及看守的角色students play the role of prisoners or the role of wardens完全进入了角色 以至于and they actually entered that role so totally一周后实验被迫中止that after a week the experiment had to be stop,而原计划是要进行两周when it was suppose to go on for two weeks.接着我们提出了一个问题And then the question we asked was,既然环境的力量如此巨大OK,so we know that the situation is powerful.能使人改变We know that it makes a difference.那能否创造出一种强大但积极的环境Can we also create a powerful,将人的最佳状态充分调动起来?positive situation to bring out the best in people?答案是肯定的And the answer is yes.我们对此做了深入分析 并谈到了And we started talking about it and we talk about professorLanger教授以及她的研究Langer and her research and how she show that putting她让一群老人置身于仿20年前的环境中um...elderly men in an environment where they were actually要求他们装作回到20年前的生活or where they acted as if they were 20 years younger这些老人竟然变得年轻了actually became younger.他们的智力水平提高了To the point of having higher levels of intelligence.记忆力提升了To the point of improving their memory.视力听力也改善了Improving their eyesight,improving their hearing.手指骨骼间的距离变长了The distance between the bones in their fingers actually这是年轻的迹象became longer which is a sign of younger age.他们自评及互评都认为They were rated by others as well as by themselves自己更健康 更年轻了as stronger and younger just because they acted as if就因为他们装作自己处在1959年it was 1959 instead of what it was really was,而不是1979年 这就是积极环境的力量which was 1979. The power of the positive situation.她还进行了另一项实验And then she did another more research on对象要进行视力检查people going for an eyesight test,他们被安排在了飞行模拟器里and put them in a situation in a flight simulator.做完全一样的视力检查And the exact same eyesight test,因为环境的不同 测试结果竟然提高了they actually performed better just because of the situation.然后我们接着继续讲 上回结束的地方就是And we moved on that what we ended last time分析影射 影射是...by talking about priming. Priming is...可以从意识及潜意识两个层面进行can be done in the conscious or subconscious level.是指在我们的意识或潜意识中植入It means planting a seed,planting a belief,planting a word,一粒种子 一种信念 一个词或一幅画面or a picture in our mind,consciously or subconsciously.以及如何对我们行为产生影响And how that actually influences our behavior.Bargh在纽约大学时So Bargh,that time of NYU,进行过一项研究 他用"年老"的相关词did the research where he primed to people影射实验对象with words associated with old.如果你们还记得 这些词包括皱纹Words if you remember such as wrinkles,年老 佛罗里达words such as old,words such as Florida.这种影射导致的结果是And as a result of this priming,实验参与者走路更慢了those participants in the study actually walked slower,更佝偻了or actually were more stooped.研究者进行评估时When evaluated by researchers并不知道每个对象的实验条件who were not aware of their condition,meaning they didn't know也就是说不清楚他们是被影射了对照词whether they were primed with control words,随机词 还是年老相关词just random words,or with words associated with old.所以通过影射 人们的行为So it was just through the priming that people actually的确会发生改变started to behave differently.环境的力量 外界的力量The power of the situation. The power of the environment.然后Bargh将实验更进了一步And then Bargh took it step further and said,决定用使用积极的影射 比如成就OK,let's prime the with positive primes such as achievement,毅力 成功such as persistence,such as success.比如这些词These words,for example,成就的近义词they had to find a synonym for the word achievement.实验对象被影射这些词后Those who are primed with these words on intelligence test智力及记忆力测试的成绩and on memory test actually performed better比没有影射的对照组好than the control group who wasn't primed with these words.两位荷兰研究人员Dijksterhuis和KnippensbergTwo Dutch researchers - Dijksterhuis & Knippensberg,也进行了影射实验 他们找了一批人what they found was that they brought people,请他们为下一次实验进行描述and they ask them to describe for future experiment,不是本次实验not for that experiment.让他们为下一次实验For a future experiment,ask them to describe描述三种原型的典型日常行为及其性格:the typical day or typical characteristics of three archetypes -足球流氓 秘书及教授a soccer hooligan,a secretary and a professor.描述这三种原型Describe these three archetypes.他们被告知 这是为下次实验做准备And they told them this is for the next experiment需要这三种原型的描述where we just want people to evaluate these archetypes.但他们不知道的是 通过对原型进行描述Not knowing that actually by describing these archetypes,自己已经被影射了these individuals were primed.他们分别被影射为足球流氓 秘书They were primed for a soccer hooligan,for a secretary,或教授or for a professor.影射后 他们接受了智力测试And then they have to do intelligence tests afterwards,及记忆力测试memory test after those primes.描述足球流氓日常行为的人Those who had to describe the day of soccer hooligan表现得最糟performed the worse.无论是记忆力还是智力In terms of memory. In term of intelligence.然后是描述秘书的人Then there was the secretary and those who performed the best表现最好的 是描述教授的人were those who described the professor.而他们之前并没有更努力学习Now they didn't study any harder before.什么也没有改变 除了发生了影射Nothing changed except for the fact that there was a prime,that环境中有东西植入了他们的思想there was something planted from the environment in their minds.现在的问题是The question then is,我们如何为自己创造一个积极的环境how can we create a positive environment for ourselves,让自己受到积极的影射 变得更幸福where we are primed by the positive,where we can be happier,更成功等等more successful and so on.方法有很多And there's many ways in which we can do it.我跟大家分享几个Let me share a few.其实这将是你们这周的作业之一In fact there's going to be your assignment for this week,即创造一个积极的环境or one of the assignments to create a positive environment.举几个例子So you are some of the examples.找一些你爱的人或地方的照片Have pictures of people you love or places you love,the这些东西很重要 因为即使你不看它们importance of these things is that even if you don't see them,潜意识中还意识到它们的存在you see them. So on the subconscious level it's still there.虽然只是在潜意识层面Even though on the subconscious level,人们被影射时 看不见...那些词when people are primed,they don't really see...the word,比如"成就"这个词出现在屏幕上25毫秒say achievement on the screen,when it's there for 25 mini-second,根本不可能看清 但大脑却记录了下来they don't really see it,but it registers.所以即使你挂了照片但没去看它So even if a picture is there and you don't "really" see it或没意识到它 念到它or not really conscious of it,mindful of it,它仍然会对你造成影响it still has a impact on you.所以找些你爱的人的照片So have pictures of people you love,让你开心的东西 无论是纪念品have pleasant object,whether it's memorabilia,鲜花 艺术品 你最喜欢的艺术品whether it's flowers,whether it's art,your favorite art.我家中和办公室都挂了So I have in my house,and my office,我最爱的画 由我最爱的艺术家创作my favorite art on the wall,by my favorite artists.让我跟你们分享一下And let me share with you a few.我今天带到课堂上来了 它们价值连城I actually brought them here. These are very valuable.我给它们投了保 所以不用担心 瞧I insured them,so it's not a problem. So... so this is,um,这位画家处在艺术生涯第一阶段时的作品this specific artist from the first phase of his career,如你所见 充满了有力的线条as you can see,you know,very powerful strokes,非常强烈 非常从容 真是绝了very intense,very deliberate,and just gorgeous.另外一幅And here is,仍是那位画家 进入艺术生涯第二阶段by the same artist from the second phase of his career.印象派对他作品的影响已经清晰可辨了Here you already begin to see impressionist influence不过你仍能从中看出同样的特点on his work. But still,you know you see the same trait,同样的力量 同样强烈的情感the same power,the same intensity.这些都挂在我家墙上So I have these on my wall.我还想向你们介绍一位画坛新秀There's a new and upcoming artist who I want to introduce you to.她还没进入第二阶段She still doesn't have a second phase,因为她才一岁大you know,she's only one year's old.这幅画是在她妈妈帮助下完成的But,you know,this is a work done with the help of her Mom.但是我还是挂在墙上 每天提醒我But again,these are on my wall and they remind me everyday虽然我已经看过几百次了even I've seen them hundreds of time,但还是挂着 让我想起我的孩子们it's still there and I think about my kids.我挂了些其他的...And I also have other,you know,名气不比他们的画家作品less known artists' work on my wall.你们可能没听过这画Again,this is,probably not heard of this one,这是罗丹的《沉思者》um,this is Rodin,The Thinker.也挂在我的墙上 是我最喜欢的雕塑And,so I have this on my wall,it's my favorite sculpture.还有罗丹的另一幅作品And then I have another piece by Rodin just to remind me提醒我生活不仅要沉思 还有其他的that it's not all about thinking,there are other things让生活更美好that make life make life worth living.这是罗丹的《吻》So this is Rodin's The Kiss,for those of you who know it.所以找些东西挂在墙上And again have these things on your wall创造一种让你觉得温暖create(s) the environment where you feel warm,觉得开心的环境where it's fun for you to be there.名人名言 我喜欢名人名言Quotes,you know I love quotes,你们很多人肯定也喜欢and I know that many of you love quotes.已经有人把他们最喜欢的名言发我了Some of you have sent me your favorite quotes.我墙上也有一列名言I have on my wall a list of quotes and they are there就算我没看它们 也能感受到even if I don't see them,I see them.比如 让我看看有没有带来So for example,let's see if I brought some here.好 在这里呢Yes,here they are.这句说亚当斯总统说的So one is by John Quincy Adams."耐心和坚持总能奇迹般地"Patience and perseverance have a magical effect before扫除困难和障碍"which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish".将"坚持"用于影射So priming the issue of persistence,插一句 Bargh的实验也囊括了这个词by the way which is one thing that Bargh did it.受到影射的人的确变得更坚韧不拔He primed that and people actually became more persistent.乔治.艾略特 原名玛丽.安妮.艾凡斯George Eliot,or also known as Mary Anne Evens,我最喜欢的作家 她写过"推动my favorite author. She wrote," The important work of moving人类进步的重任 不能等待完人来完成"the world forward does not wait to be done by perfect men".大约三周后 我会讲到完美主义I'll talk about perfectionism which is a very important,对我个人来说是非常重要的私人话题very personal thing for me in about three weeks.可以说她是我的榜样So she is a very much a role model.加缪说过"在深冬里 我终于发现在Camus,"In the depth of winter,I finally learned心里有个不败的夏天"that there was within me an invincible summer".这句话帮助我走过了艰难困苦A quote that has helped me through difficult,through hard times.亨利.戴维.梭罗Henry David Thoreau,"如果一个人能昂首挺胸地朝着梦想前进"If one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams,努力实现他想象的生活and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined,他会与成功不期而遇"he will meet with success,unexpected in common hours ".同样地 我都挂在了墙上 还有其他的Again,I have these quotes up on my wall,and a few others,其中许多名言你们都在课上读到过了that many of the quotes that you've seen in the course.它们不断影射我 提醒我And they prime me,they remind me,为我创造出积极的环境they create the environment for me.我们会在下一节讨论艺术及其重要性We'll talk about art in the next section,and its importance.把喜欢的书放在手边 听听音乐Have you favorite books next to you. Listen to music,要集中注意听but listen to it mindfully,不要只当背景音乐 要让音乐激发你not just as background music but the music that inspires you,185无论是摇滚 还是痞子阿姆 都可以whether it's rocky,whether it's Eminem,whoever it is.多看看激励你的电影Watch films that inspire you,这些东西能帮你创造积极的环境all these things help you to create an environment有助于成长 获得成功与产生幸福感that is conducive to growth,to success,to well being.其中大部分都是在潜意识层面上进行的A lot of this is done on the subconscious level这就是影射的力量 对于影射的研究which is the power of the priming. A priming studies.这也是积极研究的意义And finally this is what positive research is about.如果我们总是关注"消极"研究 焦虑If we constantly focus on "negative" research,anxiety,压抑 精神分裂症 就会被这些研究影射depression,schizophrenia,we are primed by this research,被这些工作影射 创造出现实we are primed by this work. And it creates reality.你们有些人可能知道You know,this indirectly and conjunctionally relates to,这与冰山理论有这千丝万缕的联系some of you may know,the Isenberg principle,即当你度量某种现象时is that when you measure a phenomenon,就是在改变这种现象you are changing the phenomenon;当你度量某种现象时when you are measuring a phenomenon,也是在改变自己you are also changing yourself.所以通过研究积极环境 我们也是在So by researching the positive we are also priming ourselves对自己影射积极的东西with the positive.今天包括下周 我谈到的很多内容Now,a lot of this work that I'm talking about today and I'll talk其实都是源于自助运动about next time actually comes from the self-help movement.自助运动确立于20世纪In many ways the self-help movement was founded,并从各个方面展开was started in the 20th century...其理论基础为我们通过思考创建了世界was started with the understanding that we create the world我们的思维创建了时间through our thinking,that our mind creates the world.1930年代相关书籍开始出版And books like these came out,back in the 1930's,比如《思考致富》Thinking Grow Rich.从30年代至今销售超过6千万本This book since 1930's sold over 60 million copies.而且仍不断再版It's still selling.至今还是畅销书 不论在美国It's selling,it's the best seller in the US,中国 印度it's the best seller in China,in India,非洲还是欧洲it's the best seller in Africa,it's the best seller in Europe.它对人们产生了巨大影响It has an impact on people and here's one of the things作者Napoleon Hill这样说过that Napoleon Hill says,"只要你想得到 只要你相信 你就能够做到""Whatever your mind can conceive and believe,it can achieve."只要你想得到 只要你相信 你就能够做到Whatever your mind can conceive and believe,it can achieve.非常鼓舞人心Very empowering.对各类人群 对大众产生了很多影响And this had an impact on many different people,on the masses,6千万本销量 史上最畅销书籍again,60 million copies,one of the best sellers in history.Henry Ford也发表过类似的看法Henry Ford had a similar idea,"不论你认为自己行还是不行 你都是对的""Whether you think you can or can't,you are right."许多人都这一理念吸引 为什么And people were drawn to this message. Why?因为它鼓舞人心Because it's empowering,让他们觉得没有什么不可能的because it makes them feel that things are possible.另一本极具影响力的书Another very influential book,Norman Vincent Peale的《正面思考的力量》The Power of Positive Thinking,Norman Vincent Peale."要有美好的希望 并全力以赴去追求"Have great hopes and dare to go all out for them.要有远大的梦想 并全力以赴去实现Have great dreams and dare to live them.要有宏伟的期望 并深信不疑"Have tremendous expectations and believe in them."多么让人为之一振啊How inspiring for people to hear that,只要你思考all you need to do is think,只要你相信 就会获得富足all you need to do is believe,and affluence will come to you.无论是精神的富足Whether it's intrapersonal affluence,还是物质的富足whether it's monetary affluence.这一理念对大众一直有着巨大吸引力And this is been the message that has drawn the masses时至今日仍是如此and continues to do so today.当今最畅销的励志书The best selling book today,全球销量第一 没错 《秘密》No.1 best seller all over the world,that's right,The Secret.成功的秘密就是 所谓的"吸引力法则"The secret to success is,what they call,the law of attraction.即 你的生活是被你吸引过来的The law of attraction is that you attract to your life无论你想象什么 无论你相信什么whatever you imaging,whatever you believe it.有一条强大的讯息Again,a powerful message,本书已经卖出了几百万本millions and millions of copies of this book being sold.就在我们说话当口 仍在热卖As we speak,continue to be sold.而它传达的讯息其实很简单:相信就会成功And the message is again simple: believe,and you will achieve;构想就会实现conceive,and it will be conceived.在现实中就会实现In reality,in the world,it will come to you.让人信服 鼓舞人心Very convincing,very inspiring message.但是 这条讯息正确吗But,is this message right?这我们讨论过 还有Roger Bannister的故事Well,we talked about this and we saw the Roger Bannister story.他在4分钟 准确说是3'59跑完了1英里You know one day,or six weeks after Roger Bannister runs6周后John Landy将这一成绩缩短到3'57.a mile in 4 minutes,or in 3'59,John Landy runs it in 3'57.9.一年后37名运动员都能跑到4分内了The year after 37 runners run the mile in under 4 minutes.其中有一定奥妙So there is something to it.一但他们相信能办到 就有可能实现Once they believed it was possible,it became possible.但问题是And here is the issue,当今的心理自助运动的发展趋势with much of what's going on in the self-help today,当今的自助领域强调某个真相self-help realm today,it draws on a truth,将这个真相过分鼓吹a real truth and then blows it out of proportion.没错So yes,某种意义上我们的精神的确能创造现实there is some truth in the fact that our mind creates reality.但是这不是全部But that's only part of the truth.我们创造了现实 或者说是共同创造We create reality or rather we co-create reality.还会受到外界或者内在的某些影响There has to be something out there or in there,比如《秘密》for example,when it comes to The Secret.如果你相信自己可能会成功If you believe that you are likely to succeed,那成功的可能性会变大you are much more likely to succeed.但离不开刻苦勤奋与坚持不懈But that has to come with a lot of hard work and persistence,而且失败避免不了it has to come with a lot of failure,你要从失败中学习and learning from that failure.所以这只是等式的一半 而这些自助书籍So it's just half of the equation and what these self-help books传达的讯息往往言过其实 效果甚微and messages do is overpromise and under-deliver,甚至可能会造成毁灭性后果which at times can be destructive.比如 如果一切皆建立于吸引力法则上For example,if everything is based on the law of attraction.我创造了一切I created everything that一切都因我而变 一切都是我的错everything is up to me and also everything is my fault.举个极端点的例子Even taking to the extreme,如果3岁小女孩被虐待 那是她的责任吗is a 3 years old girl responsible for being abused?30岁的男子被酒醉驾车的司机撞成瘫痪Is a 30 years old man responsible for being paralyzed是他自己的责任吗as a result of an accident by a drunken driver?有些事情是我们无法控制的There are certain things that are out there所以一切因我而变and when we say that everything is up to us,一切都由吸引力法则决定everything is created by the law of attraction,这种说法短期内可能能让你then it's a prescription maybe in the short term for inspiration坚定信念 获得幸福感 但是长期来看and for belief and for wellbeing,but in the long term,只会让人感到挫败 内疚 不快乐it's for frustration,for guilt,and for unhappiness.00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,900离成功越来越远And also for less success因为如果我真的相信一切都由思考决定because if I really believe that it's all about thinking,这种想法就会成为我的心态习惯then this is going to be my mind set.只要有信心All I need to do is believe and then钱就会滚滚而来all the money will come to me.爱情就会降临于我All the success in a relationship will come to me.这抹杀了勤奋工作...And that does away with the hard work,坚韧不拔以及失败的作用with the persistence,with the failure that is necessary,它们也是成功 幸福 完满人生的必要组成部分part and parcel of a successful,happy,fulfilling,human life.我给大家放一段短片I want to show you a quick video.是我在网上看到的一段广告This is of an ad I saw online and I actually called the于是我向苏格兰皇家银行索要了原版Royal Bank on Scotland and asked them to send me the original.因为它抓住了当今人们对精神力量的Because it captures some of the misunderstanding某种误解that there is today about the power of the mind.很诙谐的一则广告Just a very cute ad.Douglas 也是参加会议的Douglas from the conference.00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,740- James Aderson - 你好- James Aderson. - Oh,yeah.这儿风景真不错That's a lot of green.那是什么鸟？What kind of bird is it?- 怎么回事 - 不知道- What's that?   - I don't know.没事的 各位 我上过一门课程It's ok guys! I've done a course.- 什么? - 正面思考-What? -Positive thinking.正面的思考会产生正面的影响Positive thought makes a positive impact.明白不 正面的思考会产生正面的影响OK? Positive thought has a positive impact.看着我 没事的 来Look at me. That's right. Okay,come on.(紧急启动)(Emergency Start)语言不能代替行动Talk is no substitute for action.这就是思想的力量That's the power.创造现实 苏格兰皇家银行集团Make it happen. The Royal Bank of Scotland Group.- 我真厉害 - 真的耶- I am good. - Yes,you are.它抓住了部分真相 但不是全部It captures part of the truth but not the whole truth.我们看看严肃研究So let's see what serious research对精神力量的解释has to say about the power of the mind.一种神奇的现象A real phenomenon,actual phenomenon,but one但还是需要通过实验来研究其原理that we need to also apply real research to see what works.Albert Bandura 你们本周的阅读任务Albert Bandura,on your reading about for this week,做了许多关于自我效能的研究has done a lot of work on the concept of self-efficacy本质上是自信的学术术语which is essentially the academic term for believing in oneself.以下是他进行几十年研究后的结论And here is what he writes after decades and decades of research.去年他获得了授予积极心理学家的He by the way won the researcher's prize for研究者奖项the positive psychologists last year进行了很多这方面的研究 他是斯坦福大学的教授so he's doing a lot of research in this area. He's from Stanford."自我效能感影响人们生活选择"Beliefs in personal efficacy affect life choices,动机水平 机能的质量 对逆境的适应力level of motivation,quality of functioning,resilience to对压力和沮丧的抵抗力adversity and vulnerability to stress and depression."相信自己的人 充满信心Those you believe in themselves,who have confidence,在生活的不同领域都表现出色 他还指出do well across the different areas in their lives,He continues,认为自己高效能者"People who regard themselves as highly efficacious act,think,与认为自己无用者and feel differently from those who perceive themselves想法感觉完全不同as inefficacious.他们创造自己的未来 而不是简单地梦想They produce their own future,rather than simply foretell it."换句话说 他所说的是In other words,what he's talking about here is that对生活充满信心的人these people are scribed in their lives.他们创造自己的人生 与那些They create their own lives as oppose to those由他人摆布的人不同 他们适应力更强that are being prescribed by others. They are more resilient,对困难与挫折的应对力更强better able to deal with hardships and difficulties.换句话说 能力更强In other words,better capacity我们之前讨论过应对挫折的问题as we discussed earlier to deal with difficulties.这项研究的重要性在于 经过长年累月的Now the important thing about this research,研究发现 这些能力是可以习得的in his research over the years is that it can be learned.可以慢慢培养It's cultivated over time.否则研究就是无用的 至少对我们来说是So it would be useless if,in terms of research,如果通过研究他得出结论at least for us if he would say,说这种能力只是天生的well,some people are born with it,and others are not.有些人天生就有适应力基因Some people are born with,what they started to talk about,其他人没有the resilience gene,and others are not born with that.幸好情况不是这样But that's not the case.他的研究表明这些都可以习得的What he has shown is that it can be learned.但要花时间和经历It takes time,it takes effort,我们以后会讨论如何培养and we will talk about later how we do it.重要的是 这些能力是可以锻炼的But the important thing,it's malleable.我们可以改变它We can do something about it.Curry做过一项关于运动员的研究Other research by Curry on college athletes,下面一定坐着许多运动员I know there are many athletes in this room.她证明了一旦成为运动员She showed that 56% of your successes as an athlete,56%的成功是由期望度决定的once you start being an athlete,is determined by levels of hope,成功取决于你坚信自己能取得成功的程度by how much you believe that you are going to succeed.记得第一或第二节课上Remember from very first or second class我提到了John Carter的研究where I talked about the research by John Carter,有关商...哈佛商学院毕业生的about the business...HBS graduates.他预测...Where he predicted...有两个因素会影响他们的长期成功where the two things predicted success in the long term,某些毕业生会格外成功extraordinary success of these grads.一是他们不断地提问One was that they were constantly asking questions,二是他们相信自己and two was that they believed in themselves.他们相信自己能行They thought they could do well.但需要意识到的是But it's important to also realize that不是所有这些差异it's not 100 percent of the variances that was explained,都能用希望 信念或乐观来解释的by hope,or by belief,or by optimism,很多自助书籍想引导我们这么认为as many of the self-help books would have us believe.但当然这些是成功的一部分But it's certainly part of the equation of success.Nathaniel Branden从事心理治疗50年了Nathaniel Branden has been a therapist for fifty years;他做过许多严谨全面的哲学及心理学研究he's done a lot of rigorous philosophical and psychological致力于对自尊概念的探究research and work on the concept of self-esteem.等我们进行到自尊课时We'll visit him more in-depth when we talk about,会详细讲他的研究when we have the week on self-esteem.现在我只引用他的一句话But for now,just a quick quote:"我们每个人自尊的水平"the level of our self-esteem,in another words,也就是自信的程度the level of our belief in ourselves,对我们的方方面面有着深远的影响has profound consequences for every aspect of our existence:比如我们的待人接物how we operate in the workplace,how we deal with people,能取得的地位 能取得多少成就how high we are likely to rise,how much we are likely to achieve还比如在个人领域and,in the personal realm,我们会与谁坠入爱河with whom we are likely to fall in love,我们与配偶 孩子及朋友的关系how we interact with our spouse,children,and friends,个人幸福的水平"what level of personal happiness we attain."物质富足与幸福感Very low levels of correlation或生活地点与幸福感between material affluence and wellbeing,属于低度线性相关or between where we live and wellbeing,而自尊与幸福感属于高度线性相关very high correlation between self-esteem and wellbeing.大多数研究发现两者的相关系数In most research what we found is a 0.7 correlation可以达到0.between the two constructs.我的论文也获得了相同结论This is what I found in my dissertation as well.所以自尊非常重要So self-esteem matters.内在因素很重要 我们提高自信水平时The internal matters and what we are doing when we enhance发生在我们身上的是when we raise our levels of belief in ourselves我们在转变精神 改变"容器"is we are transforming our mind,we are changing the form,这样我们看世界的角度不同了so that we see we interact,we see the world differently,有了不同的理解与感悟we perceive different things,处事待人的方法不同了we experience things in a different way.庆祝成功Whether it's successes that we then celebrate,从失败中学习 转化为机遇or failures that we then learn from and turn into opportunities.但最重要的是我们的内在But so much of it is about what we have inside here.Branden说过"自我概念即命运"Branden,"self-concept is destiny."与"只要你想得到 只要你相信 你就能够做到"Very similar to"whatever your mind can conceive,it can achieve"非常相似 Napoleon Hill说的from Napoleon Hill.唯一的不同之处是The only difference being that he also他对此进行了严谨细致的思考与研究puts a lot of rigorous thinking and research there以证明信仰的局限性and shows the limitation of the belief.这一领域的另一个研究Here is another example of research done in the area大多数都听说过which most people know about.安慰剂效应The Placebo effect.你头痛 去看医生You go to the doctor,you have a headache,医生说 我给你开种药the doctor tells you: here I have a pill for you.非常有效 新出的The best thing. Just came out recently.能治疗你的头痛Will help you get over the headache.你吃了药 头不痛了Gives you the pill. You get over the headache.你不知道的是 她给你的其实是糖球Unbeknownst to you,what she gave you was,a sugar pill.但是因为你以为But because you thought,因为你相信它能治好头痛because you believed that it would help your headache,还真治好了 真是神药啊it actually did help your headache. Real phenomena medicine.于是Herbert Benson 在河对岸So Herbert Benson,from the across the river,医学院的老师from the medical school here,对此做了一系列研究has done a lot of research in this area.我着重跟大家讲两个Let me share with you just two of his studies.他找了一些处在妊娠期What Benson did was bringing women who had,胃部不适的妇女who were pregnant,and who had stomach problems...她们都有呕吐恶心的症状they were vomiting,they were throwing up,they were nauseous,这其实挺常见的something which is relatively common尤其是在怀孕初期的三个月especially in the first trimester of pregnancy.他告诉她们So he brought them in and told them,"这里有一种新药"I have this new pill for you能缓解你们胃部不适that will help you overcome your stomach distress.治疗呕吐症状You won't throw up any more after;非常有效this is a very powerful and good pill."于是他把药给了她们So he gave them that pill and they got over她们的胃部就好了their stomach distress,they were better.当然 她们不知道那只是安慰剂They didn't know of course this was just a placebo drug,普通的糖丸just a sugar pill.然后他将实验更进一步Then he took it step further,找来了另一组有同样胃部不适brought in another group of women with the exact呕吐症状的妇女same stomach distress,with the same vomiting.把药给她们Gave them the pill,告诉她们可以缓解胃病he told them would help them overcome their stomach distress.但是这次 他给的不再是糖丸Only this time,instead of a sugar pill,而是小剂量he actually gave them small dosage,没有危险性的小剂量的吐根not dangerous but small dosage of ipecac.你们可能知道吐根...Now those of you who know what ipecac is...是催吐时服用的药物It's a drug that we take if we want to throw up.如果发生食物中毒So if we have food poisoning,就需要服用吐根催吐we take these drugs and it will actually elicit vomiting.他给这些病人服用了吐根So he gave them this drug and again,这一实验通过了道德审查 没有风险this passed all the ethic reviews and was not dangerous,you know他给这些病人服用了吐根But that's what he did.并告诉她们能治疗呕吐And these women were told that they'd get better.而她们也的确恢复了健康And they did get better.本来应该出现的呕吐症状不仅没有出现Not only did they not vomit as they should have done,由于服用了吐根更该呕吐的 实际上呕吐却停止了more so with the ipecac,they actually stopped.我给大家读一段摘录自他的《永恒的治疗》Let me read to you an excerpt from his book,我非常推荐这本书which I highly recommend,Timeless Healing."引人注目地是 病人的恶心感与呕吐反应I quote,"Remarkably,the patients' nausea完全终止了 且根胃内水球测量and vomiting ceased entirely and their stomach contractions,胃胀现象也消失了 恢复正常as measured through the balloons,returned to normal.因为她们相信她们服用的是止吐药Because they believed they received anti-nausea medicine,竟然逆转了催吐药的作用the women reversed the proven action of a powerful drug.虽然很多人在医药箱储存了吐根Even though many of us stock our medicine cabinets and first aid以防食物中毒发生kits with ipecac to bring about vomiting in case of poisoning,这些胃部不适的孕妇these pregnant women with documented stomach distress thwarted却抵御了本该让她们更难受的催吐药物the action of a drug that should have made them even sicker.单凭信仰就治好了病痛With belief alone,they cured themselves."但这不是说药物没有效果Now,this doesn't mean that drugs don't have an effect.我不推荐大家回家以后You know,I don't recommend going home now and,给你们的室友you know,giving your roommates,服用吐根 甚至氰化物you know,ipecac or even worse cyanide然后告诉他们这是维生素Cand then tell them this is actually Vitamin C.他们一般不会感觉好they will probably not feel better or healthier as a result.但这一实验But what this experiment dose,及其他类似实验表明and many others like it show is that powerful effect我们不应忽视精神的强大力量of the mind which we shouldn't discard.而需要研究并理解它We need to study it and understand.Benson在他的书中还写到了另一个实验Well,here is another experiment that Benson writes这项实验是在日本进行的about in his book. This was done in Japan.实验对象对某种植物过敏So,people who are allergic to a specific plant他们被蒙着眼睛带进实验室were brought into a lab,had their eyes closed,and then,研究人员用过敏植物碰触他们一只手臂they had these plant touch their forearm,然后用另一种植物碰触另一只手臂and then they had another plant touch their other forearm,但没有告诉他们哪边是过敏植物and they didn't know which was which.理论上被过敏植物碰触的手臂And of course that plant that they were allergic to,会发出了疹子 出现过敏反应the arm flared up. They were allergic to it after all.但是 实验还有另一个条件But then,their was a second condition,他们被告知会过敏的植物these people were told that the actual drug(plant)碰触了他们的左手that they are allergic to touched their left hand,不会导致过敏的植物and another plant that they were not allergic to碰触了他们的右手touched their right hand.但是Benson将两者对调了But Benson reversed the effect,即真正会导致过敏的植物so actually the plant that they were allergic to碰触的是他们的右手 而不会导致过敏的touched their right hand,and the plant that碰触的是他们的左手they were not allergic to touched their left hand.所以按理说 应该右手起疹子 而非左手So they were supposed to flare up on the right,not on the left.但是因为他们误以为左边的才是But because they believed that the allergic plant过敏植物 所以左手起了疹子was on the left,their left hand flared up,而右手没有their right hand did not.因为精神的力量Based on the power of the mind.但同样的 这并不是说外在因素不重要Once again,this does not mean that the external doesn't matter也不说明生活中的一切都是被吸引过来的and that we attracted everything that we want to into our lives,但是这的确证明了精神but it does mean that the mind plays a very important role对构建我们的生理 情感 认知in creating our physical,certainly emotional,以及外在环境起了重要作用cognitive as well as external reality.信念常常会成为自我实现的预言Beliefs very often become self-fulfilling prophecies.但它是如何作用的呢?But how does it work? How does it work?我想跟大家分享一个模型Let me share with you this model that是我根据这一领域大量研究建立起来的I created based on a lot of research in the field.它基本上解释了我们的信念及希望That essentially tries to explain how our beliefs,是如何影响我们的表现的our expectations impact our performance.无论是安慰剂效应Whether it's through the placebo drug,还是我们学习 体育运动 恋爱关系等whether it's our performance in school,in sports,生活各个方面的表现in relationships,in every area in our lives.换句话说 这盒子里是什么In other words,what comes in the box here?这上面应该有哪些内容?Or in the...over here?是什么斡旋于信念期望What comes,what mediate between beliefs,及实际表现之间?expectations and actual performance in the real world?我想谈谈两个机制I want to talk about two mechanisms.第一个相对简单易懂The first one is very straight forward,即动力relatively simple,it's motivation.如果我相信我能行So,if I believe that I can do well,各位可以回忆一下自己的经历and think about your own past experiences,当你相信你能做好某事时when you believe that you could do well in something,00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,170会非常有动力you are much more likely to be motivated如果你认为自己希望渺茫than if you think that you are hopeless and have no chance,那就很有可能就此放弃 无所作为you are much more likely to resign and not do anything.你不仅事前会受到激励You are much more likely to be motivated before无论是训练 还是练习the event whatever the event may be,in training,in practice,而且正式进行时也会动力十足as well as during the event,while it's taking place.想想Marva Collins的研究Think about what Marva Collins did.她激励学生She motivated her students,545让他们相信他们能获得成功she made them believe that they could achieve,他们一生中能有所作为that they could make something out of their lives这是他们的责任and that it's their responsibility that it was up to them,这改变了他们的命运and that made all the difference for them.因为他们有了动力 所以非常刻苦Because they were motivated,they worked hard.所以动力非常重要So motivation makes a difference.除了动力外 另一样东西也会影响我们There is another thing though,in addition to motivation,即一致性或相合性的概念and that is the notion of consistency or congruence.那是什么意思What dose that mean?我们每个人对世界都存在心理图式You see,we all have a mental schema of the world,世界应该怎么样 会怎么样 是怎么样a mental schema of the way the world should be,or to be or is.比如 我的一个心理图式For example,I have a mental schema表明把东西放在半空会掉下来that suggests that things fall when left in middle air.所以我认为如果我放开这东西So I have a schema that says that if I dropped this,它就会掉下来it would actually fall.图式认为我的数学能力I have a schema about my ability in mathematics我可能是个优秀的数学家that I might be a good mathematician,我在这一领域是否有潜力that I have potential in this area or not.对其他人的态度也有图式 我喜欢这人I also have the schema about other people. I like this person.那人真好That person is a nice person versus还是那人不好 残忍this person is just not nice,cruel.566所以我们对他人 对自己So we have schemas about other people,对自然现象 都有图式about ourselves,about natural phenomenon.图式就是内在This is inside,the schema.还有外部世界And then,there is the outside world.现实发生在外部世界In the outside world,actual things take place.比如 半空中我松开手 它就会掉下来For example,when this is left in middle air,it falls.这一事实与我的图式无关This is,has nothing to do with my schema.它发生在外部世界 不管我的图式如何It's outside. It happens regardless of my schema.我在数学上的实际潜力Now I have certain potential也与我的图式无关in mathematics regardless of my schema.某个人对他人A certain person behaves generously and benevolently是慷慨仁慈还是可憎无礼toward other people or in a hateful manner也与我的图式无关toward other people regardless of my schema.所以内部和外部两个因素So there is what's inside and what is outside,共同作用就是关键and here is the key point.我们的精神不喜欢内部与外部You see,the mind dose not like when there is a discrepancy存在差异between what is inside and what is outside.我们的精神喜欢两者一致相合The mind likes when there is consistency,如果不相合congruence between the two,and if there is no congruence,如果不一致if there is no consistency,我们就会产生异议感then we experience a sense of dissidence,觉得不适then we experience disease.感觉不舒服 不对劲Doesn't feel good,doesn't feel right and we do,very often,所以我们常常不惜一切 让两者统一everything that we can to get the two on par again.要么改变外部现实Either by changing the external reality要么改变自我思维以符合外部现实or by changing our mind to match the external reality.我们不喜欢不一致We don't like when there is inconsistency.有好几种方法There are a few ways in which可以重建一致性we can create this consistency again.我给大家介绍几个Let me share with you just some of them,我会讲4个 都是互相关联的and I'm gonna share four. They are interconnected.互相联系 还有重合之处There is relationship between. there is overlap,但这样能帮助你们就此进行思考but just so it helps you to think about it.帮助你们理解内部与外部间That helps you understand the dialogue that takes place发生的对话between what is inside or what is inside and what is outside.两者差异发生时So the first thing we can do when there is a discrepancy,我们首先能做的就是更新图式when there is inconsistency between the two is update schema.这是第一种做法This is the first thing we can do.比如 原来我不知道松开手东西会掉下来So,I didn't know things fell when left in middle air,现在我知道了 于是我更新图式now I know,I updated my schema.又比如 我原来以为那人很可恶Or,I thought that person was actually hateful,但我看到他们对别人慷慨仁慈but I just saw him behave generously and benevolently,于是我更新图式 他是个好人now I update my schema,he's a nice person.第二种做法The second thing that we do,通常比第一种更普遍which happens much more often than the first one,即忽视或抛弃外在信息is ignore or discard in external information.忽视或抛弃We ignore and discard external information不符合图式的外部信息that doesn't match our schema.我们不喜欢不一致We don't like this inconsistency,于是直接扔掉这种不一致we just throw this inconsistency out,也就是忽视 抛弃它so to speak,by ignoring it,discarding it.00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,780第三种方法The third thing we do,主动验证we actively seek confirmation.我们会主动寻求验证信息We actively seek confirmatory data.想想2和3 想想现实世界I mean,think about No.2 and 3,think about in the real今年正是选举年you know we are in the midst of election year.想想你不会投谁的票Think about the person you are not going to vote for,或者你以前没投过谁or the person you didn't vote for.我们是怎么做的?通常 比如What we do? Very often,let's say,我看到布什总统做了件好事I see President Bush doing something good,为我信仰的某个事业奋斗actually fighting for a cause that I believe in.但我之前没给布什投票 举例而已But I didn't vote Bush,for instance.于是多数情况下 我会选择Very often what I would do is ignore忽视抛弃这条信息and discard that information,然后寻找有利证据以支持...and then look for confirming evidence that will suggest...or that坚定我讨厌布什的立场will confirm to me why I don't like Bush in the first place.这同样适用于今后的选举 比如希拉里或奥巴马This same regarding,say the future elections,Hillary or Obama.如果我不喜欢他们 我就会寻找相应证据If I dislike them,I would look for confirming evidence证明我为什么不喜欢他们why I dislike them and even if they do things即使他们做了什么我喜欢 重视或信仰的事that I like and value and believe in,通常我会选择忽视I very often will ignore these things and discard them.我们所做的 就是创造另一个现实And what you are doing here,you are creating a reality因为我们在质疑because you are asking a question such as布什做过什么恶where has Bush done terrible things or希拉里或奥巴马做过什么恶where has Hillary or Obama did terrible things?当我们问这些问题时And when we ask these questions,我们已经完全忽略抛弃正面的东西we completely ignore,discard,not see the positives.记得我问你们几何性质吗Remember when I ask you about the geometric shapes?你们没看见车上的孩子You didn't see the children on the bus.虽然他们就在你们眼前Even though they were right there in front your very eyes.所以质疑会创造现实So we know that questions create reality,而为了保持一致性and in order to maintain this consistency,我们常常会采取二者中的一种方法we do very often one of these two things.要么忽视抛弃 要么寻找有利证据Either ignore and discard,or seek confirming evidence,无论积极或消极 来支持我们的图式positive or negative to back up our schema.是希拉里 奥巴马好 还是布什好Hillary,Obama is good or Bush is good或是其他任何看法or whatever it is that we are thinking about.第4件事直接得多 即创造新的现实The fourth thing is much more directly,creating a new reality.1954年5月6日前的现实是什么What kind of reality existed before the 6th of May,1954?当时的现实是 4分钟It was reality in which four minutes是人类的极限 不可能突破was the limit of human ability.爱迪生做...抱歉 Bannister做了什么And what did Edison do,sorry,what did Bannister do?他说可能 于是改变了外在现实He said it's possible and then he changed the external reality.不仅是他自己 还有世界上其他赛跑者Not just for himself,but also for other runners in the world.突然间创造了新的现实And suddenly a new reality was created.起初的图式是4分钟不可能跑完Initially the schema was four minutes is not possible,或者说4分钟不可能跑完or rather four minutes is not possible而所有人都拥护这个图式and everyone adhered to this schema.Roger Bannister认为是可能的Roger Bannister came and said,it is possible,他改变了现实 不仅为自己and changed that reality,not just for himself,也为其他赛跑者but for other runners who were there.事实是 当干劲十足的人达成后The thing though is,that after we perform with high motivation,干劲没那么足的人可能也会寻求统一low motivation might looking for consistency.我们需要解读自己表现All that is left us to do is interpret our performance.成功还是不成功 好还是坏Was it successful or not successful,and good or bad?有两种解读方法And there are two forms of interpretation.一是客观解读One is the objective interpretation,我考试得了A还是Cdid I just give A in an exam or did I get a C.跑步我是第三名还是最后一名Did I just come third or did I come last in their race.周五与普林斯顿大学的冰球赛Did I just be Princeton in hockey on Friday?是赢了还是输了?哈佛加油 到底发生了什么?Or did I lose to Princeton? Go Harvard. So what happen?这就是现实 客观This is the reality. It's objective,its objective. But then,但同时 还有由信仰决定的主观解读there is also the subjective interpretation based on my beliefs.举个例子Let me share an example with you...有个关于托马斯.爱迪生的故事This is a story told about Thomas Edison.爱迪生于1870年代Thomas Edison,back in the 1870's,与科学界都在研究灯泡was working along with the rest of the scientific community如何用电发光on the light bulb,on generating light from electricity.整个科学界都在研究这一课题The entire scientific community or much of it was working但一无所获on that,on that issue,with no success,爱迪生也不例外Thomas Edison being no exception.当地报纸的一名记者A journalist from one of the local papers前去采访爱迪生came to Thomas Edison to interview.他当时已经非常有名了 发明了很多东西He was already famous by then,he invented many things.他们谈了各种话题And they were talking about various things然后开始讲灯泡问题and then they got to talk about the light bulb.那个记者对爱迪生说 "爱迪生先生"And the journalist said to Edison,"Mr. Edison,您致力于灯泡研究许多年了you've been working on the light bulb for many years.整个科学界都在进行相同研究The rest of the scientific community has been working on it,但毫无所获"to no avail."当时爱迪生已经进行了5000次实验Now at that point Thomas Edison had conducted 5000 experiments,这位记者也知道 于是他对爱迪生说so,and the journalist knew that so he told Edison,"爱迪生先生 您已经进行了5000次实验"Mr. Edison,you've conducted 5000 experiments,失败了5000次 放弃吧"and you failed 5000 times. Give it up."你们可能知道 爱迪生听力不好Now Thomas Edison,some of you may know was also hard事实上 他有一项专利就是助听器of hearing,in fact one of his patents was a hearing aid.所以他对记者说"你说什么So he said to the journalist," Excuse me,what did you say?"那个记者重复"我说你失败了5000次The journalist said,"well,I said you failed 5000 times,放弃吧" 爱迪生回答"我没有失败5000次give it up." So Edison responded,"I didn't fail 5000 times.是成功了5000次I succeeded 5000 times.我成功证明了哪些方法行不通"I succeeded in showing what doesn't work."同样的客观现实 表现 5000次失败Same objective reality,performance,5000 failed experiments,但却有完全不同的解读but very different interpretation.那个记者也其他科学界认定The journalist and many other people这是不可能达成的in the scientific community conclude its not possible,但爱迪生的主观解读the interpretation,subjective interpretation of Edison it's just却是他走向成功的敲门砖 因为是可能的another stepping stone towards success because it is possible.事实是 爱迪生在发明灯泡前就宣布In fact,Edison declared,before he had the light bulb,他将在1879年12月31日that on the 31st of December,1879,展示灯泡he would display the light bulb.这是在他发明灯泡前That was long before he had done it.1879年12月31日 爱迪生向世界展示了On the 31st of December,1879,Edison displayed to the world,用电发光generating light from electricity.同样地 1962年 肯尼迪总统说Just like in 1962,John F. Kennedy said that there would be a man60年代末人类将踏上月球on the moon by the end of the decade.那时我们连登月的物质条件...And there was before we had the materials necessary for doing it,科学技术都还不具备before we had other technology necessary for doing it.他向全世界放话说He threw his knapsack over the world人类能踏上月球 然后创造了现实and said it's possible to do it. And that created a reality.这与大量的辛勤工作是分不开的That was coupled with a lot of hard work.事实上 爱迪生失败了不止5000次Edison in fact failed more that 5000 more times才最终发明了灯泡before he actually created the light bulb.他不是干坐在实验室说It wasn't just sitting his room and saying,"相信就能做到""I believe therefore I will achieve."而是我相信 而且我会加倍努力It was I believe and I will work even harder now,满怀斗志地工作with more motivation and so on.他的一条名言是"我从失败走向成功"One of his mantras,"I failed my way to success."爱迪生是史上最富创造力最多产的科学家It is no coincidence that Edison,by far the most creative这并不是巧合and productive scientific genius of all time.他一生申请了1097项专利he patented 1097 patents in his career.当今世界的发展 大半要归功于他Much of our world looks the way it looks,00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:52,290史上最成功最富创造力的科学家thanks to him. No coincidence,but the most successful,也是失败次数最多的科学家creative scientist in history is also,as far as we know,这并不是巧合the scientist who had failed the most times.还有Dean Simonton的研究Research by Dean Simonton,we'll talk about it more depth等我们谈到完美主义时会精讲when we talked about perfectionism.Dean Simonton的研究证明Research by Dean Simonton shows that史上最成功的科学家与艺术家the most successful scientists and artists through our history也是失败次数最多的were also the ones who failed the most times."Babe"Ruth是职业生涯中全垒打次数最多的球手No coincidence that "Babe" Ruth,who hit during many of the years他也是三振出局最多的when he played the most homeruns,also hit the most strike outs.其中有5个赛季 三振出局次数最多In five of these seasons,was strike out the most times rather.史上最成功的人往往是The most successful people in history are also very often,失败次数最多的the people who had failed the most times.这一句话我会反复在课堂上重复This is a sentence that I'll repeat it over and over again学会失败 从失败中学习in the class and here it is: learn to fail,or fail to learn.学会失败 从失败中学习Learn to fail,or fail to learn,成功别无他法there is no other way to succeed.学习如何工作别无他法There is no other way to learn,in terms of how to work,要学习如何在科学 政治或艺术界and there is no other way to learn in terms of learning取得成功 别无他法how to succeed as scientist,or as a politician,or as an artist.正如Dean Simonton指出的那样 纵观历史The artists,as Dean Simonton showed,who had the most dubs,那些有过最多次挫折 最多次失败尝试的艺术家the most failed attempts through out history were also也是最终看来最成功的艺术家the artists who were the most successful in the long run.成功没有捷径No short cuts.只是坐下来思考It's not enough to just sit down and think,构想和相信是不够的and conceive and believe.我们要做的比这多得多We need to do much more than that.Martin Seligman 他被认为是积极心理学之父Martin Seligman,considered father of positive psychology,做了一些有关乐观主义和悲观主义的研究has done a lot of work on optimism and pessimism.他发现And here is what he found.他发现 就目标设定而言What he found was that when it comes to goal setting,悲观主义者不论在他们的短期目标pessimists are realistic in terms of their short term goals还是长期目标上都很现实as well as in terms of their long term goals.现实是好事That's good thing to be a realistic.短期目标和长期目标都很现实Short term goal as well as long term goal realistic.而乐观主义者很现实 抱歉 乐观主义者与之相反Where as optimists are realistic,sorry,optimists on the other在他们的短期目标设定上并不现实hand,are unrealistic when it comes to their short term goals,但对于他们的长期目标就很现实but are realistic when it comes to their long term goals.这是怎么回事? 让我们再来看这个模型Why is that? Well,let's look at the model again.我们先来看悲观主义者So let's take the pessimists first.他们有某个目标 他们的期望低They have certain goal,and they have low expectations,信念不高 他们不认为自己能做好low levels of beliefs,they don't think they would do well.积极性低 他们的大脑寻求一致Low levels of motivation,their mind looks for consistency,他们的表现通常取决于and their performance is usually according to他们的信念和期望their beliefs and expectations.他们的理解是 我早跟你说了And the interpretation is,I told you so.我早就跟你说了我做不好I told you I couldn't do well here.于是其他人都异口同声说是的 你早就跟我们说了And then everyone else in a chorus says,yes,you told us so.你这样现实真是好啊How wonderfully realistic of you.但有时悲观主义者超出了自身的期望But then sometimes a pessimist succeeds取得了成功beyond his or her expectations.那么又会怎么样呢?And then what happens?这时的解释是 低水平的信念The interpretation is,low levels of beliefs,那么解释就是 只是走运而已so the interpretation is,well,it was lucky,是因为火星转到了金星的前面it was because Mars was in front of Venus,50年难得一遇 不会再发生了and that only happens once every 50 years,won't happen again.或者 今天是我的幸运日 或者是因为她今天表现得不好Or,it was my lucky day,or,she just played very poorly today.于是 大脑在寻求一致And then,the mind looking for consistency,一次又一次地重复这个循环they go around that loop again and again,然后再一次变得现实and then become realistic once more.不成功的现实 但是现实Unsuccessfully realistic,but realistic.于是他们在短期目标上So they're realistic in the short term同样也在长期目标上很现实as well as in the long term.我们现在来看乐观主义者Let's look at the optimist now.乐观主义者一开始有着很高的信念The optimist starts with high levels of beliefs,很高的期望 积极性 非常高high levels of expectations,motivation,incredibly high.他们的大脑寻求一致性 表现 没那么好The mind looking for consistency,performance,not so good,没期望中的那么好not as good as the expectations were.换言之就是 不现实In other words,unrealistic.但是 由于信念水平很高 他们的解释However,the interpretation,because of high levels of beliefs,其主观的解释是the subjective interpretation is,好吧 如果我从中吸取教训了会怎么样? 这是个机会OK,so,what if I learn from it? This is an opportunity;我这次其实做得有进步了 就当吸取教训了I've actually got better this time. What if I learn?他们依然保持着很高的信念And they still have high levels of beliefs很高的期望and high levels of expectations.积极性很高 大脑寻求积极性Motivation is high,the mind looks for consistency,他们的表现依然不好they perform,still not good,没有他们所期望的那么好 不现实not as good as they expected,unrealistic.但解释依然是 如果我从中吸取教训了会怎么样?But the interpretation,still,what if I learn from it?我这次做得好多了I've gone even better this time.我指出了哪些方法是不可行的 然后他们继续I've shown what doesn't work. And they continue.但然后外界的声音就会争吵说But then comes the quarrels from the outside and says,"不是吧 真的么 你为什么就不能现实点"come on,really,why can't you be realistic像你的好兄弟或者好姐妹 悲观主义者那样"like your good brother or sister,the pessimist."但是他们相信他们能做到But they believed that they can do it,于是一次又一次地继续坚持 继续努力工作and they continue to persist and to work hard again and again.5次 10次 有时5000次 甚至10000次5 times,10 times,sometimes 5000 even 10000 times,久而久之 直到他们带来了"不现实的现实"并让它成真until they bring the "unrealistic reality" and make it realistic和他们的信念相一致了to match their beliefs over time.所以即使在短期看来 现实可能不一致So even though in the short term,the reality may not match,我可能接下来10年跑一英里I may run the mile for the next 10 years in 4 minutes都要4分12秒或者4分2秒and 12 seconds or 4 minutes and 2 seconds.但我终将到达目标 让我不现实的But I'll get there eventually and make my unrealistic"期望"和目标变成现实"expectations" and goals realistic.经历很多失败 经历很多努力付出Through a lot of failure,through a lot of hard work,经历很多坚持不懈through a lot of persistence.Seligman就乐观主义和悲观主义的内容所展现的What Seligman shows about optimism and pessimism is not并非只是某种遇事过分乐观的自我感觉良好that it's not just some pollyannaish feel-good,你知道 构想然后相信之类的方式you know conceive and believe,kind of approach.而是关于我们如何解释事件Rather,it's about how we interpret events.比如 我如何解释我的失败?So for example,how do I interpret my failure?最后的结论是 大惨败 放弃As end of the story,catastrophe, give it up?还是一个通向成功的机会?Or as an opportunity for success?所以他 我们下次课会谈到So he distinguishes,and we'll talk about it more next time,他把解释一件事分为是he distinguishes between interpreting an event永久的还是暂时的as permanent or temporary.我没发明电灯 那么这可能意味着I just didn't create light from electricity,so that could mean,这是不可能的 我永远也做不到 或者也可能意味着well,it's not possible and I'll never do it or it could mean,这是向成功的更进一步well,this is another step towards success:告诉我了什么是不可行的showing what doesn't work.我想要的一份工作被拒了I've just being turned down from a job that I wanted,这意味着我永远都找不到工作well,it means I'll never find a job或者这是个暂时的挫折 来看看我学到了什么or that's a temporary setback. Let's see what I can learn.来看看我怎么样能重新寻找并Let's see how I can home my search and find,最终找到我理想中的职位eventually,my ideal position.也要看人的态度是一概而论还是有针对性It's also about being pervasive or specific.悲观主义者认为事物是...Pessimists look at things that's being...他们一概以消极眼光看事情the negatives,being pervasive.我不是个好的科学家还是...Well,I'm just not a good scientist versus...我只是这一次的这个实验没做好well,I just wasn't able to get this experiment right this time.或者如果考试得了低分 我就是白痴Or if I get a poor grade on an exam,I'm just stupid.看什么都是一概而论 不是全部就是一无所有Pervasive,everything,all or nothing.而相反可以认为我只是具体这一次考试没考好Versus I just didn't do well here on this specific exam.我从中能吸取什么教训并且下次如何能考好What can I learn from it and how can I do better next time.这就是乐观主义和悲观主义 而这种态度可以习得This is what optimism and pessimism is. And it can be learned.很多有关这方面的研究...表明学习主观地A lot of research in this area...showing how learning to interpret像乐观主义者 解释事件可以获得更高层次的成功events subjectively as optimists leads to much higher success.你们中的而有些人可能知道Matt Biondi 1988年汉城奥运会Some of you may recognize Matt Biondi. 1988 Seoul Olympics.许多人都认为他能追平Mark SpitzMany people thought that he could equal Mark Spitz7块金牌的记录records of seven gold medals.第一场比赛 银牌 巨大的失望First race,silver medal. Huge disappointment.第二场比赛 铜牌 巨大的失望Second race,bronze medal. Huge disappointment.大家 我记得很清楚Everyone I remembered that very distinctly.人们谈论着他如何受到压力的影响People talking about how he falls under pressure,他不是我们所期望的那个人how he is not the person we thought he is.Martin Seligman在那时说"不 他将会成功"Martin Seligman at that point said "no,he's going to succeed"为什么? 因为他衡量过他和许多其他运动员Why? Because he measured him and many other athletes在乐观与悲观方面的水平on their levels of optimism and pessimism.Matt Biondi一直是个乐观主义者And Matt Biondi was a constant optimist.他知道他会将这些"失败"理解为 我指的是And he knew he would interpret these "failures",I mean,you know奥运会上的银牌和铜牌 算是失败 对吧?bronze and silver medals in the Olympics,failures,right?这些相对于他期望赢得7块金牌来说 是失败But these relative for him expected to win seven golds,failures,但他不会把它们视为永久性的失败he would interpret them not as permanent.把"我发挥失常 我不能在奥运会上实现目标""I choke. I can't make it in the Olympics"视为 "我再也不能游好泳和赢比赛了"as pervasive "I can't swim well anymore and win"而只是视为暂时的和特定的失败 他也正是那么做的to temporary and specific,which he did exactly that并赢下了接下来的5块金牌and won the next five gold medals.这让很多人吃惊 但Seligman和他的研究小组没有Surprising many people,not Seligman and his research team他们非常清楚他的理解方式who knew exactly what his interpretation style would be屡"败"屡战following these "failures".这同样也和社会和身心健康有关Also it associated with social and physical mental health.比如我们的免疫系统 心理上和生理上的免疫系统For example,our immune system,psychological and physical immune因为乐观而实际上增强了system is actually stronger as a result of being optimists.适应力水平 Karen Reivich的很多研究表明Resilience levels,a lot of research by Karen Reivich shows如果你教人们积极地 乐观地理解事物that if you teach people to interpret things positively,他们就更有可能成功optimistically,they are much more likely to succeed.如果有谁有兴趣了解更多这方面的内容 看她的书Those of you who are interested in more about this,her book,《适应力因素》 Karen Reivich写的 很不错的书The Resilience Factor,Karen Reivich,fantastic book,她在书里讲到了一个为期where she talks about programs implemented where within几个星期的项目 孩子们此后两年都a few weeks kids are immune to the experience of depression对忧郁的经历免疫two years hence...那些学习如何乐观的人People who learn to be optimistic and she teaches them她在短短两周时间里对他们进行指导in a short period as two weeks compare that00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:04,320并和剑桥Summerville五年的研究做对比to the five years of the Cambridge Summerville Study.在短短两周时间里 那些被教导Within as little as two weeks,people who were乐观地理解事物的人变得更快乐taught optimistic interpretation style become happier,学过的人患上忧郁的可能性those who learn it are eight times less likely减小了八倍to experience depression.有忧郁经历的可能性减小了八倍Eight times less likely to experience depression,只是简单地学习一种不同的理解方式if you simply learn a different interpretation style.我没有失败5000次I haven't failed 5000 times;我成功地发现了什么是不可行的I've succeeded in showing what doesn't work.所以如果我这次没做好So what if I didn't do well now,我下次或者下下次会做得更好I will do better next time or the time after that.学会更积极地理解事物的人People who learn to interpret things more positively事实上活得更长actually live longer.我们将会谈到一些这方面的研究And we'll talk about some of this research.你会读到一些这方面的内容 修女研究等等You'll read about a bit of it,the Nun Study and so on.积极地理解事物或者更乐观的人People who interpret things positively事实上活得更长or more optimistic actually live longer.那并不是说所有的悲观主义者都短寿Now that does not mean that all pessimists die young而所有的乐观主义者都长寿and all optimists die old.那只是这个等式里的因素之一That's just one of the factors that goes into the equation,还有其他的因素there's many other things.你知道 也有不现实的乐观主义You know,you don't want,there is also unrealistic optimism我们稍后会谈到that we'll talked about it in a minute.你知道 一个乐观主义者说You know a person is optimist and says,"无论如何 我会活到120岁"他有吸烟的习惯"I'll live to 120 no matter what"and smokes,you know,但一天抽120支烟很可能活不到120岁120 cigarettes a day would probably not live to 120.所以这不只是只是信念 还有很多因素So it's not just about the belief,but a lot of it is.最后 正如我屡次提到的 它是可以习得的And finally,as I mentioned time and again,it can be learned,我们将讨论要如何学习它 我们能怎么学and we'll talk about how it can be learned and how we can learn,而在你的课后论文里 你们将研究这个问题and you'll do it whether it's in your response paper,不是这周的 是下周的论文not for this week,but for the next week,或者是通过分组作业 或者独自完成as well as in sections,as well as by yourselves.一种能被习得A technique that can be learned并有所有这些积极效应的方法and can have all these positive effects.好吧Okay.但是有一个问题There's a problem here though.我要如何区分这两者You know,how do I distinguish between this现实的乐观主义和不现实的乐观主义and realistic optimism and unrealistic optimism.用盲目乐观主义做例子Detached optimism that is advocated in for example对于自助运动而言for self-help movement.是不是所有我认为我能实现的Is everything that I think of I achieve我构想的都能变成现实?and conceive and becomes a reality?我的自我概念是否我的且是我唯一的命运?Is my self-concept my destiny and my only destiny?或是否存在所谓的不现实信念?Or is there such a thing as unrealistic beliefs?确实存在这样一个东西And there is such a thing as unrealistic beliefs.下面是个例子Here is an example.她的叫Rena 是个歌舞女郎 至少对我来说她是Her name was Rena,she was a showgirl,at least to me,she was.Rena和我有很多共同点Rena and I had a great deal in common.我们都十几岁 我12岁 她14岁We were both in our teens, I was twelve. She was fourteen.我们都5英尺高We both were in our fives.她5英尺6英寸 我5英尺1英寸 我爱上了RenaShe was 5'6. I was 5'1. I was in love with Rena.Rena也爱她自己Rena too was in love with herself.现在 只是做个边注 我有一个很棒的妈妈Now,just as a side note,I have a wonderful mother,很好的妈妈 她相信我and amazing mother who believes in me.而事实上当我们三个And in fact when the three of us.我们三兄妹放学回家时We were three brothers and sisters would come home from school.我们经常会跟妈妈讲学校里We would very often talked to our mom about everything发生的所有事 好事还有坏事that was going on in school,good and bad.我有一天回家 意识到我是真心地 疯狂地So I came home after I realized that I was truly and madly爱上Rena 她就是我的真命天女in love with Rena and that she was the one for me.我回到家 告诉了我妈妈I came home and talked to my mom about it.我告诉她 "妈妈 我那么地爱她"And I told her,"Mom,I love her so."于是她说 "那问题是什么?"So she said," what's the problem?"我就跟她解释了她比我大And I explained to her that she was older that I was学校里的那些大男生也对她有兴趣and all the big boys in the school were interested in her,她比我高多了that she was much taller than I was.而我妈妈对我有信心 她采用了And my mother believed in me and went on自我应验预言的那一套self-fulfilling prophecy campaign.尽管她从没读过Napoleon HillAnd though she had never read Napoleon Hill,她对我说 "Tal 只要你想得到she said to me,"Tal,whatever you conceive,只要你相信 你就能做到"whatever you believe,you can achieve."尽管她从没读过Branden 她对我说And though she had never read Branden,she said to me,"Tal 你的自我概念就是命运 而Rena就是你的命运""Tal,your self-concept is destiny. And Rena is your destiny."她告诉我如果我真的真的认为我可以And she told me that if I truly,truly believed that I could,相信Rena会喜欢我 她就真的会喜欢我that Rena would want me. She really would want me.我妈妈激励了我 让我相信自己And my mom inspired me and made me believe in myself.于是我去接近Rena 我做好了准备So I went ahead to approach Rena,and I prepared for it.我认真做好了准备I really prepared for it.虽然我那时还没有刮胡子 但我喷了些须后水Though I wasn't shaving at that time,I put on aftershave.然后我继续行动And I continued.我可以做到 我知道我能I can do it. I know I can.我走进Rena 但这时音乐停止了And I approach Rena,but then the music stopped.00:59:57,190 --> 01:00:00,尽管我期望很高And though I had very high expectations,尽管我预想我能成功and though I envisioned success.我闭上眼睛 我看到自己成功了I closed my eyes and I saw myself succeeding.她没有兴趣 她不喜欢我She was not interested. She didn't want me.但是 但是 我们成为了很好的朋友However,however,we became very good friends.事实上我们关系那么好 她会跟我谈论In fact so good that she would tell me about她那些肤浅的高大的男朋友们all her shallow and tall boyfriends.当我妈妈告诉我她真的对我有信心Now when my mom told me that she really believed in it,她认为我是-- 她用意第绪语对我说that she thought I was,you know that she told me this in Yiddish她说(意第绪语)and she said "foreign language"在意第绪语里的意思是 "你是个大发现"which means in Yiddish "you're a big find."我真的 真的就是I was really my,you know,really,我那犹太母亲心中符合犹太教规的皮格马利翁I was my Jewish mother's kosher Pygmalion.好烂的比喻 我知道So bad,yeah.那句话花了我不少时间想出来的You know,that took me a lot of time to think about,你们最好表示一下喜欢它you'd better appreciate it.但是...谢谢 谢谢 但这没有用But...thank you,thank you. But it didn't work.再一次 别误解我 我非常感激我妈妈And again,don't get me wrong,I'm very grateful to my mom.简直就像是全天候的驻家Marva CollinsI literally had 24/7 Marva Collins in my house.我是那么地感激我妈妈 但是 这一次I owe so much to my mom. However,in this case,这可能不是现实的信念it probably was not the realistic belief.那么什么是现实的?So what is realistic?我们如何区分什么是现实的 什么不是?How do we identify what is realistic and what is not?下面是一些对我们有帮助的想法Here are some ideas to help us do so.斯托克代尔悖论The Stockdale paradox.它认为要找出矛盾It's about finding the tension,让矛盾化解 这并不容易reconciling the tension and it's not easy.我不会给你们一个公式 告诉你们:Again,I'm not going to give you a formula now to tell you:好吧 就这样...算这个 如果是大于7的OK,here is...calculate this,and if it's above seven,就没有问题 低于7的 可能就不是这样go ahead with green; below seven,probably not so.不存在什么公式 但是 仅作为一个启发式There is no formula. But here is,just a heuristic,当你思考信念时 存在一些需要思考的东西something to think about when you think about beliefs.James Stockdale是名海军上将 他是James Stockdale was admiral. James Stockdale was the highest越南战争被俘人员里级别最高的战俘ranking prisoner of war in the... in the Vietnam War.他开始注意到一个现象 他在那关了很多年And he started to notice a phenomenon. He was there for years.最终被释放并得以活着向人们讲述往事 而其他许多战俘没能做到Eventually got out and live to tell the tale many others did not.他看到许多人幸存 许多人死亡And he saw many people survive,many people not survive.战俘的生存条件非常恶劣The very harsh conditions of the prisoner.他发现那些活下来的人有两个特点What he was that the people who survived had two characteristics.第一个 他们相信他们能出去First of all,they believed that they would get out,他们坚信终有一天他们会重获自由they had faith that one day they would be free.他们会再见到自己的家人 朋友They would get to see their family,their friends.这种信念支持着他们走下去And this faith kept them going.同时 也就是第二个特点At the same time,and this is the second component,他们有着现实的信念 能对情况做出估计they had realistic beliefs and evaluation of the situation.如果这两点有一点没做到If any one of these two components were missing,他们就不大可能活下来they were unlikely to survive.如果他们没有信念 他们不相信他们会活下来If they didn't have faith and they didn't believed it they would他们很可能在恶劣的环境下死去survive,they were very likely to die in the harsh conditions.另一方面 如果他们认为On the other hand,if they thought that他们能在这年的圣诞节之前就出去they would get out by this coming Christmas,and really并真的相信他们能在这年的圣诞节之前离开believed that they would get out by this coming Christmas,他们同样也不大可能幸存they were also less likely to survive.因为他们这年的圣诞节没有被放出去Because they didn't get out by this coming Christmas,他们失望 气馁 无助and then they were desponded,resigned,helpless,通常情况下 他们会死去and very often,they died.所以关键是这两点 相信你会出去So it was the two components,believe that you would get out,但同时明白自己需要but at the same time know that you need to01:03:47,910 --> 01:03:50,530应对现实 残酷的现实deal with reality and that it's tough.James Stockdale如是说Here is what James Stockdale said,"你不能把坚信自己最终会在"you must never confuse faith that you would prevail in the end输不起的情形下取得胜利的信念which you can never afford to lose同直面现有残酷现实的行为with the discipline to confront the most brutal facts相混淆 无论是何种残酷现实of your current reality whatever they might be."现实的乐观主义Realistic optimism.现在的问题是你可能有时会错Now the thing is that you may be wrong at times.有时你可能真的相信什么And sometimes you may really believe in something,相信你有现实的期望and believe it that you have realistic expectations但没有成功and not succeed.但就像我们谈到的那样...我们接下来会谈到But as we talked about...And as we'll talk about in a few minutes,这也没太大关系it doesn't matter that much.因为即使没有成功 我们能很快恢复动力Because even if we don't success we just bounce back up.继续努力工作And continue working hard.而关键就是尽可能地保持平衡The key though is as much as possible,to attain this balance.这就是Maslow所说的高水平信念What Maslow calls The Graceful Integration和与现实联系间的完美整合between high level of beliefs and connection to reality.这个不是答案No prescription here.只是一个启发 让你们记在脑子里But just a heuristic,something to keep in mind.积极的思考不是秘密本身Positive thinking is not THE secret.是的 它是这个秘密的一部分Yes,it's part of the secret.是的 它是成功公式的一部分Yes,it's part of the success formula.是的 它是幸福公式的一部分 但并非全部Yes,it's part of the happiness formula. But it's not all.错误的乐观主义迟早意味着幻灭False optimism sooner or later means disillusionment,愤怒和无望anger and hopelessness.成功的秘密是Here is the secret of success.这是一个经研究证实的秘密This is the secret proven by research.多年对不同文化 不同地方Thousand of years of research and successful people不同年龄的成功人士的研究in different cultures,in different places and in different ages.这个秘密是乐观 热情和勤奋It's optimism,passion and hard work.纵观历史 你很难找到哪个成功人士It'll be very hard for you to find successful men and women是不具备这三个品质的through out history who did not have all three.乐观 信念 坚信他们能做好Optimism,belief,faith that they can do well,坚信他们能成功that they can succeed.热情 热爱他们从事的事业 并且勤奋工作Passion,love for what they were doing. And hard work.正如爱迪生所说 没有什么能代替勤奋There is no substitute for hard work as Edison said.这三个要素 就是这个秘密...很简单 很明确These 3 components. The secret...simple,straighforward.你们都知道 还记得我第2次课上说的么You know it all. Remember what I said during 2nd class.我不会教你们新的知识I'm not going to teach you much new.我希望使你们想起你们已经知道的知识I hope to remind you what you already know.乐观 热情和勤奋Optimism,passion and hard work.那运气是否也有作用呢? 当然了Does luck play a role? Absolutely.Jefferson说"我非常相信运气Jefferson,"I am a great believer in luck,我发现我越努力工作 我的运气就越好"and I find that the harder I work,the luckier I get."运气背后实则也有科学奥妙There is actually science behind luck.你们会在《幸运要素》里读到And you'll read about it in the Luck Factor.在书中 拥有这三要素的人Where people who have these 3 components,相信自己能成功的人who believe they can do well,热爱自己的工作并勤奋努力的人who love what they do and work hard,事实上获得了更多的运气actually find more luck.用梭罗的话说就是不经意间有了更多的运气In the words of Thoreau in Common Hours.好的 那么为什么不是所有的家长都Okay,so why don't all the parents教我们要有高的期望呢?teach us to have high expectations?如果这对我们来说有好处 如果这和成功有关If it's so good for us,if it's related to success,和幸福 和身体健康有关的话to happiness,to physical well-being,为什么不是所有家长都对我们说不管你们做什么why don't all our parents just say to us whatever we work,你都能成功 你都做到you can succeed,you can do it.如果你梦想 你就能做到If you dream about it,you can do it.为什么父母和其他关心我们的人Why did very often parents and people常常要降低我们的期望呢?who care about us lower our expectations?因为他们关心我们的快乐水平Because they are concerned about our happiness.他们关心我们的自尊They are concerned about our self esteem.有很多种信念...人们相信You see,there is a lot of belief...People believe that高期望自然地会导致失望high expectations naturally lead to disappointment.所以...高期望导致失望So...high expectations lead to disappointment.这听起来是对的 这就是And it sounds right. I mean,this is the formula thatWilliam James在19世纪写下的公式was written in the 19th century by William James.他说自尊等于我们的成功He said that self-esteem is equal to除以抱负 换言之就是 我们的成就...our success over pretensions. In other words,our achievement...我们有多成功 我们取得了多少除以how much we succeed,how much we achieve over我们假装或期望所能取得的 我们的目标what we pretend or what we aspire to,what our goals are.换言之 如果我们有很高的期望 很高的抱负In other words,if we have high expectations,high pretensions,我们就有更大的可能伤害自己的自尊we are much more likely to hurt our self-esteem.例如 比如说我的渴求 我的抱负For example,let's say my aspiration,my pretension,我的期望是一个月挣4千美元my expectation is to make 4 thousand dollars a month.重申一下...我只是举了个数字化的Again this...I just throw in a numeric例子 这样便于理解example here because it's easier to understand.让我们假设我的希望是一个月挣4000美元Let's say my hope is to make 4 thousand dollars a month.那是我的抱负That's my pretension.但实际上结果我一个月挣到了2000美元But in fact what I end up making is 2 thousand dollars a month.根据William James的公式 我的自尊According to William James' formula,my self-esteem,而我们都知道自尊和快乐and as we know self-esteem and happiness是紧密相关的are very highly co-related and related.我的自尊 我的快乐水平My self-esteem,my happiness level根据这个公式便只有一半according to this formula is a half.另一方面 假设我的抱负On the other hand,let's say my pretensions,我的期望是一个月挣1500美元my expectation is to make 1.5 thousand dollars a month而事实上我一个月挣了1500美元and in fact I make 1.5 thousand dollars a month.根据这个公式 我的自尊According to this formula,my self-esteem,我的快乐水平是my happiness level is 1.尽管我挣的更少了So here even though I'm making less,我这里举的是数字化的例子again I'm using a numeric example here,你们可以想想其他例子you can think about other examples.尽管我实际上挣得少了Even though I'm actually making less here,我的自尊和我的快乐程度却变高了my self-esteem and my happiness are higher.所以要降低你的期望So lower you expectations.其实不尽然Not so.过去35年的研究发现What was found in the last 35 years of research这个公式实际上是错的is that this formula is actually wrong.情况不是这样的That's not the case.这才是实际的情况Here is how it actually works.让我们画一张图 横坐标是时间Let's say we have a graph. And this is time.纵坐标是我的自尊水平和快乐水平And here is my self esteem levels and happiness levels.让我们从我的基础水平开始 就在这里And let's at start off around my base level which is here.然后我参加了积极心理学的期中考试And then I had a mid-term in Positive Psych.我考得没有我期望的好And I don't do as well as I expected to.我的自尊会发生什么变化? 我的幸福会发生什么变化?What happens to my self-esteem? What happens to my happiness?当然它会下降 这很自然Of course it'll go down. It's natural我们都想成功或者说大多数人想成功we all want to succeed or most people want to succeed.所以如果低于我的期望它就下降了So it goes down if it's below my expectations但很快 如Daniel Gilbertbut very quickly as the research by Daniel Gilbert有关有效预测的研究表明...shows on effective forecasting...很快我们又回到我们的基础快乐水平very quickly we go back up to our base level of happiness.接着一个星期后 我又考了 比如说55号数学课的期中考试And then a week later I have another mid-term in say,maths 55.我考得很好 比我期望的成绩还要高And I ace it. I get much higher grade than I expected.01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:43,540我的自尊和快乐曲线又会怎么变化? 它上升了And what happens to my self-esteem and happiness? It goes up.但然后很快它又降下来But then very quickly it goes back down again.然后我们假设我是12岁 我在街上走And then let's say I'm 12 years old and I walk down我遇到了Rena 我约她出来玩the street and I meet Rena and I ask her out.她拒绝了And she says no.我的自尊和快乐水平会发生什么变化?What happens to my to my self-esteem and happiness?它下降了 轻微地It goes down. Slightly.然后很快它又重新上升And then very quickly it goes back up again.然后我很幸运 我走在街上And then lucky me. I walk down the street.我以为我看到了Rena 但她有些不同I think I see Rena but there is something different about her.原来是她的孪生妹妹And it turns out she has a twin sister.我约她出去 她拒绝了And I ask her out. And she says no.再一次 发生了什么变化? 轻微地下降And what happens once again? Slightly down.但然后我恢复了 又再次上升But then I recover and go back up again.你们是不会相信的 她们是三胞胎And you won't believe it. They are identical triplets.我碰到了老三 她答应了And I meet the 3rd sister and she says yes.她说我也爱你She says I love you too.我的自尊和快乐水平发生了什么变化?And what happens to my to my self-esteem and happiness?它轻微地上升 对吧? 甚至高出了黑板It goes up slightly right? Even taller than this.但然后很快又下降回基础水平But then very quickly back down to base level如此反复 生活中的悲欢离合and so on and so on. The vicissitudes of life...不管我是得到了终身职位还是没得到whether I get tenured or not tenured,不管我买彩票是中奖了还是输钱了whether I win the lottery or lose money.在幸福的一个基础水平上下起起伏伏The ups and downs around a base level of well-being.现在有个好消息也有个坏消息Now there is good news here and there is bad news here.好消息是我能承担更大的风险The good news is I can take more risks.她拒绝我不是世界末日It's not the end of world if she says no.我失败了或者没能得到理想的工作It's not the end of the world if I fail here也不是世界末日or if I don't get my dream job.没有关系 我会恢复 我们都会 所以这是好消息It's okay. I'll recover. We all do. So that's the good news.坏消息是...我就卡在这了?The bad news is...so I'm stuck?我根据我的基因生来就是这个基础水平So I was born with this base level according to my genes并且不能提高吗?and I can't really improve?我如何提高这个快乐的基础水平?How do I raise this base level of happiness?这是可能的 我们会讲到...And it's possible. And we'll talk about...整个课程就是关于如何提高快乐的基础水平the whole course is about raising the base level of happiness.但这有一个发现But here is one finding是从专门针对自尊的研究中得来的from specifically the research on self-esteem.你下课之后马上能做的一个实验On one thing you can do right now when you get out of class来提高自尊 就是去面对而非逃避to raise self-esteem and that is to cope as opposed to avoid.去面对意味着把自己置身于风险线上To cope meaning to put yourself on the line.不是要你在恐慌时冒险To take risks not when you're in your panic zone而是在你放松时放手一搏but when you're in your stretch zone.去承担失败的风险 去解决 去处理To risk failure. To handle things,to deal things,去面对那些对你来说重要的事情to confront things that are important to you.参加戏剧试演 讨论时说出未曾表述出的观点To try out for that play. To speak out in session if you haven't.去你十分想去To go out to a place where you really want to go却从没去过的地方 去尝试but never really try. To try.因为那些经常面对问题的人有着同样Because people who cope overtime have the same或者有时频繁的起起伏伏or sometimes more ups and downs.但他们的起伏线条是这样的But their ups and downs look like this.依旧是起起伏伏 和普通人一样Still ups and downs. Permission to be human.但基础水平提高了But the base level increases.为什么基础水平提高了? 我将以此结束本节课Why does the base level increase? I'm gonna end here.为什么当我们不是逃避而是面对时Why does the base level increase when we cope rather than avoid?基础水平提高了? 三个原因For 3 reason.首先是自我知觉理论 Daryl Bem...First self perception theory. Daryl Bem...我不记得他是达特茅斯学院还是康奈尔大学的了I think from either Dartmouth or Cornell...Daryl Bem指出我们得出关于自己的结论what Daryl Bem showed was that we derived conclusion和我们得出关于他人的结论的about ourselves in the same way方式是一样的that we derived conclusion about others.比如说看到一个人走到大家面前So for example if I see a person going up to people发起谈话或者在会上发言and initiating a conversation or speaking up in session或者去参加一出戏的试演并一次又一次地尝试or trying out for a play and trying again and again.我关于这个人的结论就是这人很有勇气My conclusion about this person is this person is courageous.这人肯定有很高的自尊This person must have high self-esteem.我可能也是用同样的方式And I may derive the conclusion about myself推出关于自己的结论in exactly the same way.通过观察自己某些方式的行为By seeing myself behaving a certain way,我会得到关于自己自尊或者I reach a conclusion about my self-esteem仁慈或者慷慨或者其他方面的结论or benevolence or generosity or whatever it is.自我知觉理论 如果我面对了 我尝试了Self perception theory. And if I cope,if I try things out那我就认为这是一个有勇气的人then I see that this is a person with courage.这是一个敢于尝试的人This is a person who tries. And my conclusion得到关于自己的结论就是我肯定有很高的自尊about myself would be I must have high self-esteem.我的自尊还有幸福水平And my self-esteem as well as happiness level久而久之就会上升overtime will actually increase.自我知觉理论Self perception theory.我们得出关于自己的结论We derive conclusion about ourselves和我们得出关于他人的结论的方式是一样的in the same way we derive conclusion about others.就是通过观察行为Meaning by looking at behavior.我们在面对失败后会意识到When we fail after coping we realize that the actual pain真正来自于失败的痛苦远小于我们想象的that comes with failure is far less than the pain we imagine我们认为与失败有关的痛苦and that we associate with failure.我克服失败 是的 我是没做好I just got over it. Okay,so I didn't do well in here或者她是拒绝了我 但我克服了or she said no. but I got over it.但我一直在想的话 我就会认为它将一直持续Whereas I imagine it in my mind I think it'll last forever.正如那些终身职位或者非终身职位的教授Just like those tenured or not tenured professors thought以为他们的薪水将永远不变 其实并非如此that their pay will last forever whereas it goes away.所以当我意识到实际上的痛苦So when I realize the pain of actual failure is far比和失败有关的痛苦远远要小时less than the pain associated with failure,我变得更自信了 我能应付了I become more confident. I can handle it.我实际上比自己想象中要更有适应力I'm actually much more resilient than I thought I was.我的自尊水平上升了And my self-esteem increases.我的快乐水平也随之升高My happiness as a result increases too.最后还有更多的成功And finally there is more success因为成功别无二法because there is no other way to succeed.学习走路没有别的方法There is no other way in terms of learning how to walk.在艺术上或科学上或商业上或政治上There is no other way in terms of succeeding in art取得成功没有别的方法or in science or in business or in politics.学习失败 从失败中学习 我们星期四再见Learn to fail or fail to learn.
