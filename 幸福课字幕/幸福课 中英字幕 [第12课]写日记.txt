大家早上好 今天
Dr.Tal Ben-Shahar:Hi.Good morning.So today
我们会先讲完"改变"
what we are going to do is finish up the lecture on change,
总结一下ABC 也就是影响 行为和认知
sum it up the ABCs- the affect,the behavior,the cognition,
然后继续讲另一个相关课题 设定目标
and then move on to a related topic which is setting goals,
这将是最后一个…
which will be the last topic
在放假前我要讲的课题
that I'll address before we go on break.The...
上次讲完了急剧变化
Last time I ended up by talking about the acute change
由探索而得的经验引起的急剧变化
that comes with a Eureka experience,
这种经验来自顿悟感和洞察力
with an ah hah,with an insight.
我们讲过五个阶段
And we talked about these five stages.
之后有些学生联系我说
And a couple of you contacted me after about this and said,
"并不是很顺利" 没错
"well,it's not that smooth" and it's absolutely right.
这是一个理论 只是一个大纲
This is a theory.This is an outline.
你写作的时候 当你思考…
When you write,when you come up with ideas,
或设定课程
when you generate course,
或是写论文时
when you write a paper or write a thesis-
你们当中有人在写论文
some of you are thesis writers,
你们常犯的错误是将它们混淆了
what you do is very often mix them.
通常你们会先准备 然后写一些
So you have preparation.Then you write a little bit.
之后休息一下 会有一些顿悟
And then you take a break.You have an insight.
再开始作更多准备等等
Then you go back to more preparation and on and on.
这只是一个轮廓 某些角度来看是很有用的
This is just a general outline,which is useful in a few ways.
首先
First of all,
我们光看着它就能明白
it is useful in that we can understand by looking at it.
没有捷径
There's no quick fix.
历史上所有的艺术家 科学家
None of the great creative artists,scientists,
商界名人都不是凭空出世的
business people in history,created in a vacuum.
他们首先得成为各自领域的专家
Initially they became experts in their fields.
他们努力工作 将自己沉浸在知识里
They worked hard.They immersed themselves in the material.
这是你们首先要记住的一点
So that's the first important element to remember.
没有捷径 我们得先付出努力
No short cuts.We have to apply ourselves.
还记得成功的秘诀吗?
Remember the secret of success?
不光是思考 想象和相信
It's not just think,imagine,believe.
必须要有努力和热情这两点要素
It also has to have the component of hard work as well as passion
所有的成功人士
So all the successful people...
再次提到 做好的自助书籍是自传
Again,the best self-help books are biographies,
好的自传会教你如何成功
good biographies that show you the process,
而不是那么简单的"五步"
not the "five easy steps".
第二个重要因素 比投入到准备过程…
The second important thing beyond the importance of immersion
更重要的是 空闲时间的重要性
of the preparation is the significance of taking time off.
今天的领导人所缺的…
One of the first thing that leaders of today,
他们所缺的其中一样东西是时间
one of the things they don't have today is time.
时间是他们最需要的
It's the thing that they need most.
有空闲时间去筹划 反思
Time off to incubate,to reflect,to metaphorically,
或只是坐在浴缸里思考
or literally,sit in the bath and think.
熟虑 发呆的时间段
That incubation,the idle time stage.
记得J.P.Morgan说过
Remember J.P.Morgan's quote:
"我可以用9个月而不是12个月来完成一年的工作"
"I can do a year’s work in nine months,but not in twelve."
那是要有所顿悟或灵感出现为前提的
And that's when the Eureka comes.That's when the good ideas come.
这些灵感来自一夜好觉之后
It's actually after a good night's sleep.
或是充分休息一段时间之后
It's after "we do nothing for a while".
或是在洗澡过程中
It's when we in the shower.
下一个重要因素是
The next important thing,
这个模型的组成部分是评估部分
component of this model is the evaluation part.
人有很多好的想法
You know,there are many good ideas,
但极少数是可以有好成果
but very few ideas come to fruition
最终成为经商的好点子
and actually become a good idea for a business,
或成为科学论文或书籍的好构思
or a good idea for a scientific paper,or a book,
或其他任何有作为的东西
or whatever it may be.
这时候就需要评估
That's when the evaluation comes
需要详细筹备
and that's when the elaboration comes.
这也就是创作的必经阶段
And these are no less important parts of the creative process.
真的需要百分之一的灵感
It really is about 1 percent inspiration
百分之九十九的汗水 没捷径可言
and 99 percent perspiration.No short cuts.
所以总结起来:ABC 也就是影响(情感)
So to summarize: the ABCs- the affect (the emotion),
行为和认知
the behavior (action),and the cognition (the thought).
我想谈一个小小的技巧
I want to talk about a technique,
一个简单的方法 就是把有深刻
a simple technique- journaling that has remarkable,
影响的事情记录下来
remarkable consequence.
请大家举起手
Just get a show of hands: how many people keep a journal
多少人有长期写日记的习惯?好
or have kept a journal for significant amount of time? OK.
这么多人有这个习惯 是件好事
That's great.That's great to see.
从这个课程和大家之前
We know from,from this course and research
接触过的研究中知道 改变是困难的
you encountered before how difficult change is.
有的项目持续五年了还是没有进展
Sometimes programs that have been around for 5 years don't help.
通常投入的资金是数百万 数十亿
Very often interventions were millions and billions.
大概每年投入巨额资金来做研究
It's about-100-billion-dollars-a year industry
才能对各行业和机构有所改变
that change industries and organizations.
很多的资金投入都浪费了
Most of the interventions don't work.
说明改变有多难
We know how difficult it is to change.
而日记呢?
And yet journaling?
有实质的研究结果证明它的作用很大
Very solid research showing how much it helps.
我跟你们分享一下某项调查
So let me share with you a study.
这项调查是由…
This was done by the person
那些将日志带进科学领域的人来做的
who really brought journaling into the scientific realm.
有些像Ira Progoff这样的人
So there'd been people like Ira Progoff and others
长期以来一直在讨论写日记的作用
who had been talking about journaling for a very long time,
但却是德州大学的Jamie Pennebaker
but it was Jamie Pennebaker from University of Texas,Austin,
将这个想法带进了科学领域
who brought this idea to the scientific realm
并真正意义上研究它 他是这么做的
and really researched it.And here is what he did.
他选了一些参与者 并让他们
What he did was bringing participants and have them do
做以下的事情:连续四天
the following: on 4 consecutive days that they came in,each day,
每天都用15分钟的时间 就15分钟
they would spend 15 minutes- that's all,15 minutes,
来写下最难忘的经历
times for writing about the most difficult experiences.
他们知道其实没人会看的
Now they knew that no one would see it.
就算被人看到
Or if they would see it,
这些日记也是匿名的 绝对保密
it would be without a name- completely confidential.
所以完全可以看成是他们的私人日记
So they were really able to treat it as their own journal.
以下就是他们得到的指示
And here was the instructions that these participants got.
有点长 但值得一读
It's a little long but worth,I think,worth reading.
"连续写下你一生中最难过
"Write continuously about the most upsetting
00:07:22,690 --&gt; 00:07:25,570
或最痛苦的经历"
or traumatic experience of your entire life.
不必在意语法 拼写或句子结构
Don't worry about grammar,spelling,or sentence structure.
在日记中 我希望你能谈谈…
In your writing,I want you to discuss
你对这经历的最深刻的想法和感受
your deepest thoughts and feelings about the experience.
写什么都行
You can write about anything you want.
但不管你选什么
But whatever you choose,
都必须是对你有着深刻影响的
it should be something that has affected you very deeply.
最好是一些…
Ideally,it should be about something
你从未怎么跟别人讲过的事
you have not talked about with others in detail.
其实挺难的 因为敞开了心扉
It is critical,however,that you let yourself go
去触碰那些你内心深处的感情和思想
and touch those deepest emotions and thoughts that you have.
换句话说
In other words,
就是写下你的经历和以前的感想
write about what happened and how you felt about it,
以及现在对它的看法如何
and how you feel about it now.
最后 你可以每次都写不同的痛苦经历
Finally,you can write on different traumas during each session
也可以整个研究过程都写同一个经历
or the same one over the entire study.
每次你可以选择任何想写的痛苦经历
Your choice of trauma for each session is entirely up to you."
很简单的做法 很直接
Simple instructions.Pretty straight-forward.
如果有留心 就知道当中包含了ABC三个要素
If you notice,you see the ABCs in it.
它包含了"写出发生的事"
So it says "write about what happened",
也就是行为
which is the behavior essentially.
写下你的深刻感受 受到的影响以及你的情感
Write about your deepest feelings- your affect,your emotions.
写下你的想法并分析它
And write about your thought and analyze it.
这样 日记里就包含了ABC三个因素
The ABCs in journaling.
他做了这项研究后 最初结果出来了
So when he did this study,initially the results came in- because
他首先看到的是焦虑水平
one of the first things he looked at was the anxiety level,
因此看到结果时 他失望了
so when the results came in,disappointment.
他考虑要不要停止这项研究
In fact,thinking of stopping the study,
因为这就是他的研究所得
because this is what he found.
大家看这幅图 这是焦虑水平
So if we have this graph,this would be anxiety level.
这是时间
This would be time.
他有一个对照组 对照组的成员
He had a control group and the control group just wrote
只是写下他们想写的东西
about anything that they wanted to write about.
随着时间推移 焦虑水平没有改变
Show no change over time.
从这里开始 一条直线过来
So they started here,and they essentially,straight line.
而干预组 实验组的成员
The intervention group,the experimental group,
经过四天 写下他们最痛苦…
after 4 days of writing about their most traumatic,
最难过的经历后
most difficult experiences.
他们的起点一样 当初分组是随机分的
They started at the same point.They were randomly divided.
他们的焦虑水平竟呈现上升趋势
And then a rise in their anxiety.
每天这么写 在这四天内
After each of the days and during the 4 days-
他们的焦虑水平上升了
rise in their levels of anxiety.
到了这个位置时
At this point,
他考虑终止研究 因为非常失望
he was thinking terminating the study- very disappointed.
因为他自己觉得…
Because he got from personal experience-
写日记对他有帮助
he knew that journaling helps him and
而也有其他人说过这一观点
knew other people who talk about it,who swear by journaling.
四天之后 从第五天开始
But then,once the 4 days are over,during the fifth,
尤其是第六天 第七天之后
especially starting 6th,7th and on days,
奇怪的事发生了
this is what starts to happen.
他们的焦虑水平降低了
Their anxiety levels went down.
达到了原来的水平
Learning that they reach the same level as before,
还持续下降
they continue to go down.
最重要的是
And the most important thing is that
在原来的水平之下保持稳定
they stabilized below the previous level.
在原来的焦虑水平之下保持稳定
They stabilized below the previous levels of anxiety,
他密切留意着这些参加者
when he followed these participants
一段很长的时间 长达一年
over a longer period of time up to a year.
四次 15分钟 足足一小时
4 times,15 minutes- that's total of an hour.
时间很短 效果是持续的
That's very little.And long lasting results.
想想 我们之前也知道
Think about it: this is also what we saw before.
有时候 简单的干预是很有效果的
Sometimes,brief interventions are extremely effective.
想想我上周说过的害羞研究
Think about the shyness study that I spoke about last week
12次 每次12分钟 让男士们与对他们…
after 12 sessions of 12 minutes with women
有好感的女士们独处
who were interested in them,
这些害羞的异性恋男士发生了很大的变化
these shy heterosexual men change radically.
所以改变其实可以发生在极短的时间内
So change can come in a relatively brief period of time
关键是我们要知道如何干预
if we know how to intervene.
而日记就是其中的一种干预方式
And journaling is one of these interventions.
我不会要你们写这个作业
Now this is not going to be one of your response paper-
因为太私人了
it's too personal.
我觉得不该布置给你们
I don't think it's appropriate to assign it,
193
但我强烈推荐你们试一下
but I certainly do recommend that you do it.
严格按照Pennebaker的指示
Follow specifically Pennebaker's instructions.
不会占很长时间
Doesn't take that long.
连续四天都做 每次15到20分钟
Do it on 4 days,15 minutes,20 minutes each time,
想到什么写什么
just write whatever comes to mind.
一段时间之后可以降低你们的焦虑感
So it was reducing anxiety over time.
这项研究的其他结果
Other results of the study-
如果你想了解更多
and if you want to read much more about it,
他有一本很棒的书 叫《开放》
he has a wonderful book called "Opening Up".
Jamie Pennebaker的《开放》
"Opening Up",by Jamie Pennebaker.
他们变得更健康
They became healthier.
一年过后 他们回去看医生的人数
So over the year of the study,they visited the doctor's office,
远比对照组的人少
compared to a control group,far less.
就是说 这项研究增强了他们的免疫系统
In other words,it strengthened their immune system,
不光是他们的心理免疫系统
not just their psychological immune system,
同时还有他们的身体免疫系统
their physiological immune system.
总得来说他们心情好了
Generally they were in a better mood.
比以前更快乐 更乐观 更积极
They were happier,more jovial,more benefit finders,
在他们记下最深刻伤痛后
after writing about their deepest traumas.
他们变得更外向 不那么压抑和忧郁了
They became more outgoing,less repressed,less suppressed.
为什么会这样呢 我们说过积极情感
Now why is that? We talked about it often that positive emotions
和痛苦情感都来自同一个输送通道
and painful emotions flow through the same pipeline.
如果我们抑制着某些事情 或停止一些…
And if we suppress something,if we stop something,
痛苦的事 我们常常会间接地
which is painful,we are very often indirectly,
同时无意中抑制一些积极的情感
inadvertently also suppressing the positive emotions,
只要他们随时敞开心胸
whereas here they open up,quite literally open up
让这些情绪尽情流露
and allow these emotions to flow through them.
那他们其实是打开了一条闭塞的通道
They are essentially opening up a clogged channel-
一条各种情绪…
a clogged channel through which emotions,
包括痛苦和积极情绪流动的通道
painful as well as positive emotions normally flow.
他们也能体验到更高层次的快乐
And they experience higher levels of happiness.
他们会更阳光 更慷慨
They are more open,more generous,
就像你做感恩练习时所得的结果一样
as we saw also when you do the gratitude exercise.
非常相似
Very similar results.
有趣的是 会有性别差异
There were gender differences,which is interesting.
男女都从中受益
Now both sexes benefited from it.
但男士比女士受益更多
However,men benefited more than women.
试想一下
Think about it.
为什么 仔细想想 其实不无道理
Why do you think that is? It makes sense,if you think about it.
受益的女士 状况大大改善
Women benefited significantly got better,
但男士受益更多
but men benefited even more.
为什么?一般来说
Why? Because women have,generally speaking- again,
这是千遍一律的说法
this is brush stroke stereotype-
但一般来说 女士敞开得更多
but generally speaking,women open up more.
她们和女伴们谈得更多
They speak more with their girl friends.
她们有密友 并对她们倾诉一切
They have closer friends and they talk about issues.
而在今天的文化中 男士还是比较保守
Men still in our culture today are much more close
因为找人倾诉有点没面子
because it's not cool to open up.
准许自己为人 不是一件很酷的事
It's not cool to give yourself the permission to be human,
尤其是有其他人在旁时
especially when others are listening.
因此 在生活中 女士们
so women generally in their lives
但尽管如此 拥有强大支持的女士
But still,even women who have strong supports systems
仍能从这项练习中获益
still benefit from this exercise,
这让我想起了另一项研究的结果
which reminds me of another result of a study
我几个月前提到过的 在课程开始时
I mentioned months ago,the beginning of the course,
提到一般来说 女人
which said women generally,again these are all averages,
我指通常情况
but in general,
或者说男人 在婚姻中比女人受益更多
women- or rather men benefit more from marriage than women.
类似的原因
For similar reason.
因为女士们原来就有支持系统
Because women already have the supports system in place.
而男人 通常这是他们第一次遇到一个
Men,very often,for the first time they are with someone,
让他们觉得能安心倾诉的人 同样
who they feel comfortably enough opening up to.Again,
尽管男女都在长期的恋爱关系中获益
both males and females benefit from a long-term relationship,
但还是男士受益比女士多
but men generally tend to benefit more than women.
他发现了因同一个原因而产生的性别差异…
For the same reason that he found gender difference here.
存在于不同文化当中
Across cultures.
这项研究分别在中国 日本 墨西哥和阿根廷做过
This is done in China,in Japan,Mexico,Argentina,
当然也包括美国 欧洲等不同文化
United States of course,Europe- replicated across cultures.
不同文化的人们都从该项研究受益
In all cultures,people benefit from this study.
还有另一项研究 用的是相反的方法
Here is another study,which took the exact opposite approach.
Laura King是Pennebaker的学生
So Laura King was a student of Pennebaker,
用相反的方法来做这项研究 她说
took the exact opposite approach and said,
"我们来研究一下…
"let's study...(inaudible)...
"看当人们…
to see what happens when the individuals
写下最快乐的经历时会有怎样的结果
write about their most intensive positive experience.
她的做法明确地根据
What she did specifically was taking the instructions
Abraham Maslow关于巅峰经验的研究
from Abraham Maslow's work on peak experience.
以下就是做法
And here are the instructions.
三次 15分钟
Once again,this was three times,15 minutes,
连续三天 总共45分钟
so 45 minutes total on three consecutive days.
"想出生命中最精彩的经历…
"Think of the most wonderful experience
或多次美好的经历 快乐 兴奋的时刻
or experiences in your life,happiest moments,ecstatic moments,
或坠入爱河极度欢喜的时刻
moments of rapture,perhaps from being in love,
或者听音乐时的欢快时刻 或突然…
or from listening to music,or suddenly ‘being hit’
发现一本好书或好画或突然灵感乍现"
by a book or painting or from some great creative moment.
选择其中一个这样的时刻
Choose one such experience or moment.
想象自己正经历这一时刻
Try to imagine yourself at that moment,
沉浸在所有与这一经历有关的…
including all the feelings and emotions
感受和情感中
associated with the experience.
尽量详细地写下这次经历
Now write about the experience in as much detail as possible
尽量写下感受和想法
trying to include the feelings,thoughts,
及当时产生的情感
and emotions that were present at the time.
尽量尝试重新经历那些情感
Please try your best to re-experience the emotions involved."
这个做法和Pennebaker的做法相反
Essentially the exact opposite of Pennebaker.
结果呢?完全一样
Results? Identical.
那些写下他们巅峰经验的人
Those who wrote about their peak experiences,
写下最快乐经历的人 去看医生的次数少了
their best experiences,visited the doctor's office less time-
就是说 这个做法增强了他们的身体免疫系统
in other words,it strengthened their physiological immune system
让他们体验更多快乐
and experienced more happiness.
不论心理还是身体上都得到同样的效果
So both psychological and physiological results.
现在来看 你们有些人可能会想
Now when you look at this,some of you may be thinking that
"那Lyubomirsky的研究呢"
"well,what about the Lyubomirsky study?"
还记得Lyubomirsky的研究吗?
Remember the Lyubomirsky study?
那项研究表示 当你写下积极情感时
That said when you write about positive emotions.
其实你感觉更糟
Actually you feel worse.
而写下负面情感
Whereas you write about negative emotions,
都会如Pennebaker所说 感觉会好些
you do feel better as Pennebaker suggested.
不同之处在于
Here's the difference.
Laura King的做法主要是…
The instructions that Laura King gave were mostly,
描述和重新体验
were mostly about describing and re-experiencing,
重现你的经历
replaying your experience.
而不是分析"怎么会发生这种情况"
It wasn't about analyzing "why did it happen","how did it"...
而是它的发生过程 就是重现
It was rather how it happen- in other words,replaying it.
当做法…
When the instructions-
而Lyubomirsky的研究是分析这种经历
and this is the Lyubomirsky study- were analyze the experience:
为什么会发生 你为什么会遇上之类的
why it happened,how did you get there and so on and so on.
这就是为什么随着时间推移 会产生负面的效果
That's why it had the negative consequences over time,
但只是重现经历
but just replaying the experience,
只写下这次经历有多美好
just writing about how wonderful it is,
重新体验当时的情感
re-experiencing emotionally what that was-
实际上会让你受益
that actually let you benefit.
有趣的问题是为什么
Now the interesting question is why.
为什么写日记能产生如此显著的好处?
Why are there such remarkable benefits to journaling?
我们来理解一下这个过程 当中的原理
Let's understand the process,the mechanism.
现在有几件事情在这里起作用
So there are a few things that are at play here.
例如你带着积极情感
One of the things for example with positive emotions is that
在回想其中一次经历
when you are replaying it,you are simply,
你其实是在增强神经通路
you are fortifying the neural pathways.
你再次重现 想象它
You replay,you imagine it again
让它像重新发生一样
and you make it more likely to happen again.
就像你面前有条河
Just like when you have a river,
记得两周前的类推法吗 你面前有条河
remember the analogy from two weeks ago,you have a river,
流过的水越多 它就变得越宽阔
and the more water go through it,then the wider it becomes,
然后越来越多水流进去
and then the more water is likely to go into it.
这是变化的本质 自我实现
That's self-reinforcing nature of change.
因此
So the first thing,
为什么写下 尤其是痛苦情感
the first reason why writing especially about painful emotions
但也不只是痛苦情感
but not just painful emotions,
之所以有所帮助是因为紧张感
the reason why it helps is because of tension.
我们之前讲过Daniel Wegner的"反语处理"
We talked about ironic processing- Daniel Wegner's work from here
而他谈到…
And what he talks about is that
当我们抑制非自然现象时 通常会适得其反
when we suppress unnatural phenomenon,it often intensifies.
比如想像一头粉红色的大象
Be it thinking about a pink elephant
或抑制痛苦的情感
or be it suppressing painful emotions.
当我们准许自己为人
And when we give ourselves the permission to be human,
我们都倾向于释放感情 放开心胸
we are much more likely to release it,to let go,
这就是治疗产生作用的原因 就是为什么和朋友分享
which is why therapy helps,which is why sharing with friends,
与人倾诉以及写日记能有所帮助
opening up helps,which is why journaling helps.
这就是抑制或压抑的概念
This is the whole idea of suppression or repression.
Pennebaker所说的另一件事是关联性
The second thing that Pennebaker talks about is coherence.
他发现的其中一件事是…
One of the things that he finds is that
那些受益最大的人 他分析了这个测试
the individuals who benefit most,and he analyzes the test,
秘密地 他对测试进行分析
confidentially of course,but he analyzes the test.
从这项研究受益最多的人
Individuals who benefit most from the study
都使用了一些领悟性的词语或词组
are once introduced a lot of insight words,or insight phrases,
也就是说到了第三天 他们都开始写到
meaning by the third day,they are all writing
"现在我知道了"或者"我明白了"
"now I see that" or "I understand that"
"我突然明白了"或"我意识到"
or "it just dawned on me that" or "I realize that".
日记里提及到这些词或短语的次数最多的人
Those who have many of these words or phrases in their writings
就是受益最大的人
are the ones who benefited the most.
换句话说
In other words,
他们已从这经历中创造出一种关联性
they've created a sense of coherence out of the experience.
他们从某些事当中得到了启示
They make sense out of something perhaps
这些事情以前也许是毫无意义的
before that was senseless.
也就是说 他们围绕着他们的经历创造出故事
In other words,they created a story around their experiences.
这经历已不再是零散的 无关的片段
It's no longer dispersed,disjointed,disconnected data.
现在已经是一个连贯 完整的故事
Now it is a coherent whole.It's a story.
现在我可以面对它了
Now I can deal with it.
仔细想想 人们通常最记得的是什么?
And if you think about it,what do people mostly remember?
他们最记得的是故事
People mostly remember stories.
为什么?你能记住一个故事
Why? Because you remember a story,
是因为它是一个整体
because it's one unit- it's a whole.
如果我现在给你们100个随机的词
If I give you now a collection of,you know,100 random words,
00:21:22,210 --&gt; 00:21:25,090
那你得花很长时间才能记住
it'll take you a very long time to commit to memory.
我们都清楚 我们都做过学术评估测试
I mean we all know,we all took the SATs.
如果我跟你讲一个故事
But if I tell you a story,
你多数都会记得
you are much more likely to remember it.
也许不是每个词都记得 但大概意思
Maybe not word for word,but certainly,the general ideas.
因为我们能将它连贯起来 可以理解
Because we can hold it,we can grasp it.
它有关联性
Because it has a sense of coherence.
我能理解 能记住
I can deal with it.I can handle it,
而不像一些零散的 不连贯的单词
as opposed to some dispersed ideas,disjointed words.
而同样的道理
The exact same here.
我们想感受到我们的生命的关联性
We want to feel that our lives have a sense of coherence
让生命变得有意义
that we can make sense of them.
Pennebaker说"我们模糊且无可预知的世界的产物之一
Pennebaker: "An artifact of our ambiguous and unpredictable world
就是对不能完满成功而产生的焦虑
is the anxiety of not attaining completion
和无法理解对一些造成痛苦困扰的缘由
and not understanding a simple cause-and-effect explanation
的简单解释"
for traumatic disturbances.
我们自然地去寻找…
Alas,we naturally search for meaning
事件的意义和完满性 它让我们有了对生命的…
and the completion of events; it gives us a sense of control
控制以及预知能力
and predictability over our lives."
这再次说明了疗法能起作用的原因
Again,that's why therapy helps,
因为我们从经验中创造出关联性
because we create coherence out of experience.
这就是大屠杀造成的创伤后遗症远少于…
This is why there was far less post-traumatic stress disorder
越南战争造成的创伤后遗症的原因
after the Holocaust after there was the Vietnam war.
因为在大屠杀之后 士兵们说出了这次经历
Because after the Holocaust,they spoke about these experiences.
他们围绕这次经历讲出一个故事 虽然悲惨
They created a story around it,a tragic one,
但还是会有关联性 和越战的经历不同
but still there was a sense of coherence,as opposed to Vietnam
对于越战 他们只有一些零散的记忆
where there was just random flashes of experiences
并没有准许自己为人 也没有这样的社会环境
without giving themselves permission,or without society,
或其他途径让他们尽情倾诉
in many ways,giving them the permission to open up
来说出一个他们可以应付
and to create a story out of it that they could hand,
可以接受的故事
they could grasp.
Pennebaker的研究大部分是以一位我们
The work of Pennebaker to a great extent relies on the work of
第一天提过的心理学家的理论为基础的
a psychologist who we mentioned on the very first day of class.
那就是Aaron Antonovsky
And that is Aaron Antonovsky.
Aaron Antonovsky
Aaron Antonovsky
我把他看作幸福心理学的奠基人之一
whom I consider to be one of the fathers of positive psychology,
如果你记得 就会想起"健康本源学"
if you remember,came up with the notion of "salutogenesis",
病理模型的替代
an alternative to the pathogenic model- pathogenic model,
就是那个专门讲病理学和疾病的模型
the model that focuses on pathology,on sickness,on illness,
Antonovsky说
where what Antonovsky said is
我们要关注的是健康的始源
we need to focus on the origins of health.
Saluto是健康 genesis是本源
Saluto- health; genesis- origin.
他的具体做法如下
And what he did specifically was the following.
他是个社会学家 他说
So he was a sociologist and he said the following-
生活是艰苦的 人们都在艰苦奋斗
he said: look,life is tough.People go through hardship.
无论愿意与否 我们都会遇到困难
They go through difficulties- whether we like it or not,
生活中 我们遇到各种困难
we all in life encountered hardships.
恋爱中 上学时 工作中
In relationship,in school,at work- whatever,whichever domain,
都有困难与挫折的存在
there are hardships,there are difficulties.
总有时候生活是艰苦的 大家都知道
Life is hard.Period.We know that.
然而 有些人…
However,there are some people
对困难和挫折…
who are able to better deal with the hardship,
处理得更好 他们…
with the difficulties,who still,
尽管不是没遇到这些困难
despite- they don't do away these hardships-
就算常遇到困难和挫折
despite these hardships and difficulties
他们仍能过上充实 满足且幸福的生活
are still able to lead a full,fulfilling and overall,happy life
不是指那种…
Not the constant high-
精神病患者或死人的那种永恒的快乐
that's reserved for psychopaths and dead people.
而是有高低起伏 但是更高层次的幸福
With the same ups and downs,but at a higher level of wellbeing,
或者说是一个焦虑水平比较低的生活
or of a lower level of anxiety.
他说我们要研究这些人
And he said we need to study those.
不该只研究有病的人
We shouldn't just study the sick people,
不管是身体健康有问题的病人
whether the sick people who are physically ill-
就是通常在医学中用作病理学模型的病人
which is mostly the pathogenic model of medicine,
还是心理方面的病人-精神分裂症病人
or the people who are unwell psychologically- schizophrenia,
忧郁症病人 还是心理学中研究最多的焦虑症病人
depression,anxiety as psychology has mostly studied.
他说我们该关注健康的人 并研究他们
He said we need to look at the healthy people and study them,
正是这个模型…
which is exactly the model
让他在80年代时调查了一些风险人群
that led to asking the question in 1980s with at-risk population:
"是什么使得某些人
"What makes some individuals succeed
在艰苦的环境中取得成功?"
despite unfavorable circumstances?"
就是因为他的这个问题 改变了一切
It was his question that made all the difference.
于是在他的研究中 他做了同样的事情
So he did the same in his research
找了一些人来做调查 问他们
and asked about the general population:
"为什么他们会健康?
"Who are the people who are healthy?
他们健康来自哪里?
And what is the origin of that health?
他们和其他人有何不同?"
What distinguishes them from other people?"
于是他发现了关联性的作用
And he came up with the notion of the sense of coherence
那些人让生活保持关联性
that people have the sense of coherence about their lives.
也就是说
What that means is that,
他说他研究并最终确定的因素有三个
he said it has three components that he researched and identified
第一:
The first component:
理解能力-我能理解世界
sense of comprehensibility- I understand the world.
世界对我很重要 我看得到 感觉到 理解到
It makes sense to me.I see.I realize.I get it.
世界 事件 困难 挫折
The world and event,difficulties and hardships,
生活的高低起伏对我来说是宝贵经历
highs and lows make sense to me mostly.
第二 管理能力
Second,sense of manageability.
我可以处理得了 能承受得了
I can deal with it.I can handle it.
我能利用各种内部和外部资源处理事情
I have the internal as well as external resources to deal with it
而不是孤立无援
as opposed to being helpless.
这是一种能效 一种自信
This is a sense of efficacy,of confidence-
能够处理突如其来的困难
being able to deal with the hardships that arise.
这就是第二个因素
So that's the second component.
最后一个因素是…
The third and the final component
如Aaron Antonovsky所说 能够产生关联性的
that makes up the sense of coherence,according to Antonovsky,
00:26:42,490 --&gt; 00:26:44,240
意义性
is a sense of meaningfulness.
困难的出现不是毫无意义的
This was not in vain- this difficulty.
我和伴侣意见不合不是坏事
This disagreement with my partner was not for nothing,
因为通过这事 我们更了解对方
because we understand one another better now.
我们会变得更亲密
And we are even close,more intimate.
我们在之间的冲突是有意义的
This failure was not in vain.
我已经从中学习到东西 并得到成长
I have learned from it.And I have grown from it.
这个错误是有原因的
This mistake has reason- again,
这件事的发生不一定是好的
not necessarily happen for the best,
但可以学习如何在事情发生后用最好的方法解决
but learning how to make the best of what happens.
他定义了这三个因素
These three components are what he identified and replicated
并被用作之后的精神健康研究来源
in later research as the source of mental health.
根据Pennebaker和Antonovsky的说法 关联感:
To quote Pennebaker- to quote Antonovsky,a sense of coherence:
是"一种整体适应性
"A global orientation that expresses the external-
主要包含三个方面
the extent to which one has a pervasive,
对生活的感受性和信心：
enduring though dynamic feeling of confidence that
(1)在生命中个体感受到
(1) the stimuli deriving from one's internal
来自内外部环境的压力
and external environments in the course of living are structured,
是明确 具体 可预测的(即领悟性)
predictable and explicable (comprehensible,in other words);
(2)个体感受到应对内外部环境压力
(2)the resources are available to one to meet the demands posed
所需资源是充分的
by these stimuli (internal resources and external resources:
可以利用的(即可控性)
I can deal with it,I can manage);
(3)个体感受到来自内外部环境的压力具有挑战性
and (3) these demands are challenges,
值得花时间和精力去应对"
worthy of investment and engagement (it's meaningful)."
看看这三点
Look at these three.
对写日记的人来说
For all those who write a journal,
我肯定能在你们的日记中找到这三点
I bet you can identify these three in your writings.
这就是日记所产生的巨大影响
This is what a journal does to a great extent.
当我们真的写下我们的经历
When we write and when we really write about our experiences,
那些艰苦的经历
our difficult experiences,
就必须要有关联感
this is very often what comes up - have sense of coherence.
我知道 我懂 这经历是很重要的
I see.I understand.Make sense.
我现在可以面对它 承受它
I can deal with it.I can handle it.
我刚找到了一种处理它的方法
I have just found a path of how to do it.
尽管只是将它写成日记
Even if dealing with it and handling it is writing a journal,
最后 它对我的人生来说 是有意义的
and finally,it makes sense to me.
它现在变得有意义了 尽管之前意义不大
It's meaningful to me now,whereas before,it didn't as much.
所以 如果你没有写日记的习惯
So if you don't have a journal,you don't journal,
我强烈推荐你开始写日记
it is certainly something that I highly,highly recommend.
我来总结一下"改变"这一课:A B C三点因素
Let me summarize the whole change lecture: the A,B and C.
三点是相互关联
The three are interconnected.
事实上 如果我们真的想有所改变
In fact,if we want real change to come about,
必须将这三点紧密连接起来
they have to be interconnected.
为什么?因为习惯就像洪水一样
Why? Because habit is like a flood.
如果我们只是开一个凹角或一条小缝
And it's not enough if we just create a small nook
是不足以养成一个新习惯
or cranny trying to create a new habit.
因为洪水会将它冲走
Because flood would wash it away.
我们需要的是结合A B和C
What we need is the A,the B and the C.
将这些变化融入我们生活中
Implement these changes in our lives.
它们是内部相连的 举一个例子
And they are interconnected.So let me give you an example.
例如那些自尊心很弱的人
Let's say someone who has low self-esteem.
低自尊心 C 认知
Low self-esteem,the C- cognition:
他们会小瞧自己
they don't think highly of themselves.
自我评价低
Poor self evaluation.
当你瞧不起自己时
When you don't think highly of yourself,
就会比较内向 感觉没自信
you are more likely to be innervated,to feel down,
更别说有动力了 也因此而产生不良影响
not to be motivated,and as a result of that,that is the Affect,
产生不好的情感
the emotion that you experience- not good feelings;
因此很可能会变得碌碌无为
as a result of that,we are much more likely to do nothing-
也就是说 B是碌碌无为
in other words,the B is do nothing.
通过自我认知理论
Now through self-perception theory,
这种行为进而影响我对碌碌无为的认知
the behavior then affects my cognition on doing nothing:
我处理不了事情 我逃避事情
I'm not dealing.I'm not coping.I'm avoiding.
这会使自尊降低
And that lowers my self esteem,
进而使自我评价更低 就是C
even more my evaluation of myself,the C.
这导致更低落的情感
And that leads to even worse emotions
等等 形成一个向下的螺旋
and so on and so on and so on,in a downward spiral,
直到在某些情况下 我们自我放弃了
until in some cases,we reach resignation,
或用Martin Seligman的话来说 就是"习得性无助"
or in Martin Seligman's words,learned helplessness.
现在 想想那些自尊心强的人
Now think of someone who has high self-esteem,
他们很有自信
high level of self-confidence.
我相信自己 我认为我能做好
I believe in myself.I think I can do well.
那样会导致高水平的激励
That leads to high level of motivation.
记得Marva Collins是怎么做的吗?
Remember what Marva Collins does?
我们讲过的关于信仰的模型
The model that we talked about under belief,
自我实现预言
self-fulfilling prophecies-
能提高个人动机和导致强烈的情感
that leads to high levels of motivations,strong emotions.
我充满动力
I'm energized.
也反过来引发更多的行动 就是B 行为
And that in turn leads to more action- the B,the behaviors.
因为我做得更多 我应对的就更多
Because I act more,I do more,I cope more.
我更多地把自己置于水平线上
I put myself on the line more.
那我对自己的积极评价就会更高些
I'm much more likely to have more positive evaluation of myself,
因此也会产生更多积极情绪等等
which leads to more positive emotions and on and on and on,
呈现一个上升的螺旋
in an upward spiral.
也就是Barbara Fredrickson所说的螺旋
The spiral that Barbara Fredrickson talks about
他在"拓延-建构"中谈到
in the Broaden-and-build,the spiral that Bandura talks about
自我能效时所提到的螺旋
when he discusses self-efficacy.
既然涉及到这方面 就很有必要介绍一下了
When we intervene,it's important to introduce,
可以的话 三点我都想说说
if possible,all three.
从哪里说起都可以
And we can start anywhere.
我举个例子 例如一个有社交恐惧症的人
So let's take an example- someone with socialphobia,
一个害怕社交活动 不善与人交际的人
someone who is afraid to be out there,in front of people.
治疗这种症状的一种方法…
One way to deal with it-
我们先从A说起 就是影响 也就是情感
let's begin with the A,the Affect,the emotion.
其中一方面是药物治疗
One way to deal with it is through medication
直接影响我们的情绪
that goes directly to our emotions.
另一方面是冥想
Another way of dealing with it is meditation,
558
同样直接影响我们的情绪
which also affects our emotions directly.
有些人比较适合第一种 有的适合第二种
Some people benefit more from one,or from the other-
这取决于他的状况有多极端
depends on how extreme the situation is.
这是A 影响
But that's the A,the Affect.
另一种治疗方法 行为
One way of dealing with it,behavior,
通过所谓的认知行为疗法来进行 曝光
is through what's called in cognitive behavioral therapy,exposure
逐步将自己曝光在产生这种恐惧的刺激物前
which is gradual exposure to stimuli that create that phobia.
首先 先走出家门10码
So initially I'll walk,you know,10 yards out of my home.
先通过想象来曝光
Initially exposure through the imagination
之后付诸实践
and I include it under behavior,
因为我们的大脑分不清楚…
because the mind does know the difference
想象和现实的差异
between the imaginary and the real.
逐渐走出更远
So gradually being exposed to it.
随着时间推移 曝光度越来越高
Over time being exposed more and more,
直到我可以去到一个商场
until I can go out to a mall
并再也没有一年前那种焦虑
and not experience the same anxiety that I did a year ago.
这就是行为治疗法
So that's through behavior.
很有效 曝光的方法
Very effective- the exposure technique.
最后 在治疗过程中还能介入认知
And finally,you can also intervene through cognition in therapy,
来处理不理智的想法 心理困惑
in dealing with irrational thoughts,psychological traps,
那三个M "我有将事情放大吗
the three M's- "Am I magnifying? The extent.
我有轻视了自己的一些才能吗?
Am I minimizing something?
例如小瞧了自己在与人相处方面的成功
For example,my successes in working with people.
我有在编造事实 想象情景吗?
Or am I making up? Imaginary scenarios.
本可以更现实地看待的事情 我有将它灾难化吗?
My catastrophizing events when I can have a more realistic view."
这就是我的想法 认知
So that's my thinking about it,the cognition.
跟你们说说我克服某种困难的做法
Let me show you a personal example of something that I dealt with
你们知道 我天生就很容易焦虑
So as you know,born through genes- high levels of anxiety.
00:33:53,020 --&gt; 00:33:53,740
我很容易焦虑
Very prone to it.
容易吃惊 容易被惊吓 现在好一点了
Startle very easily- still,less today,
但还是会容易吃惊
but still to some extent today.
以前参加壁球比赛时非常紧张
Used to get very nervous in squash matches.
在重要比赛时常常呼吸困难
Used to choke often,when I was playing important games.
但我面对的事实是
And that's something that in front of,
要在观众面前讲话 非常紧张和焦虑
speaking in front of an audience,got very nervous and anxious.
我决定要…
And this is something that I decided
克服这种心理
that I really wanted to deal with.
我面临的最大困难不是其他 而是焦虑
More than any other things that I was facing.The thing anxiety.
那我是怎么做的呢 我先从C 认知说起
So what did I do? Let me begin first with the C,Cognition.
我分析了我日记中的情况
What I did- I analyzed the situation in my journal.
利用学校咨询机构
I used the Bureau of Study Counsel.
学习并研究了关于三个M的知识
I learned and studied about the three M's,
那三种不理智的想法
the irrational thoughts-
将事情扩大化 缩小化 编造情景 灾难化
magnifying,minimizing,making up,catastrophizing.
通过认知 我得到了很大的帮助
And through cognition,it helped a lot.
但那远远不够
That wasn't enough.
学习了C之后 我开始学习A 影响
After the C,I went to the A,the Affect.
00:34:53,280 --&gt; 00:34:57,320
影响是通过身体锻炼来实现的
And the Affect was for me physical exercise.
直到今天 早上我还跑过步
You know,even today,this morning,at home,I ran.
我锻炼身体是因为…
I exercise because
它能大大降低我们的焦虑水平
it significantly lowers anyone's levels of anxiety.
可以说如果我不锻炼身体 我的口才…
And I can tell a significant difference in my talks
一定不会像现在这么好
if I don't exercise.
甚至在三四周前 我儿子David身体不适
So even three or four weeks ago,David,my son was unwell
周二早上我要先带他去看医生
and I had to take him to the doctor first thing Tuesday morning.
没有时间锻炼 我那天讲课就感觉到了
Didn't have time to exercise.Actually felt it in the lecture.
我觉得更紧张 更焦虑 明显不一样
I was more nervous,more anxious.Makes a big difference.
像我们开学时讲的一样
As we'll talk about,after break,
锻炼的效果基本和吃抗焦虑药效果一样
it literally has the same effect as taking an anti-anxiety pill.
因此锻炼对我的情绪产生直接的影响
So exercise was certainly there,work directly on my emotion.
瑜伽 在我处理焦虑和…
Yoga.Helped me tremendously
降低焦虑水平上发挥了很大的作用
in dealing with anxiety and lowering that level.
00:35:50,500 --&gt; 00:35:51,730
这是情感上的
So this was the emotional.
另一样是音乐 放松的音乐
The other thing,music.Relaxing music.
你们知道我喜欢什么音乐 就不重复了
You know my taste in music.I don't need to repeat it again.
我和Tammy结婚后 就搬到了一起住
So actually when Tammy and I got married,we moved in together.
她简直不相信我收藏什么样的CD
She couldn't believe my collection of CDs.
她说"你看起来不像这么容易焦虑的人"
She said "you don't look that anxious".
因为我买的CD是…
Because I had,um,
"世界上最放松的经典音乐"
"The Most Relaxing Classical Music in the World",
"放松音乐" "降低焦虑的音乐"
"Music for Relaxation","Music for Dealing with Anxiety",
全是些安静的音乐 整个架子都是
silent quiet music- I mean,a whole shelf of the relax...
但它们的确对我有帮助 让我得到放松
But they relax me! They really help me.
最后是行为 我介绍一下行为
And finally,behavior.Introducing behavior.
通过曝光来治疗恐惧 先是做演讲
So it is through exposure.Initially giving a talk.
因为我想当老师
Because I want to be a teacher.
我先给壁球队演讲 给我的家人演讲
Giving a talk to my squash team.Giving a talk to my family.
反正是在那些我感觉安心的地方
Places that were safe for me.
给任何愿意听的人演讲
Giving a talk to anyone who would listen.
从开始的少数人慢慢增加听众数量
Initially small groups and gradually building it up.
通过想象来曝光
Exposure through the imagination.
再强调一次
Once again,
那种想象久而久之会让人变得更自信
the imaginary thing and over time becoming more  confident.
另一样对我极具意义的事是
Another thing that for me was very significant
作为大学生 在课堂上公开发言
as an undergrad here- speaking up in section.
我不敢公开发言
I was terrified of speaking up.
当我决定那样做 我肯定
And when I decided to do that,I had no doubt in my mind
所有人都能听到我的心跳声
that everyone in section could hear my heart beat.
因为它就在我脑海中
Because it was in my head.
然而 逐渐地
And yet,gradually,
我慢慢地越来越敢于发言
I spoke up a little bit more and a little bit more,
通过自我知觉理论
and then through self-perception theory,
情况变得越来越好
it actually got better and better and better.
这些事情我一直在坚持做
And I still do all these things.
我还在做瑜伽 定期做运动
I still do yoga.I still do exercise regularly.
我还有参加认知行为治疗
I still engage in the CBT approach,the 3 M's.
我一直有写日记 内容主要和上述三件事有关
I keep a journal,which combines very often all three.
我还会听放松音乐 很有用
And I listen to relaxing music.And it works.It works.
改变并不容易 非常困难 需要很多时间 然而
Now change is not easy.It is hard.It takes time.However,
但那并不代表 这过程本身没有乐趣
that doesn't mean that the process itself cannot be enjoyable.
并不是说改变了就会快乐
It's not OK when I've changed then I'll be happy.
这过程本身就非常值得
The process itself is extremely,potentially,extremely rewarding
有时很困难 但非常值得
Sometimes difficult.Potentially,very rewarding.
那旅程本身就跟目的地一样重要
The journey as well as the destination.
关于改变的另一要点是
The other important thing to remember about change-
这话引用自一个人的作品
this is taken from the work of,
她研究精神分析学
really the person who took the psycho-analysis
并把这门学科提升到了积极层面 Karen Horney
and transformed it into a more positive approach- Karen Horney,
我之前提到过她
who I mentioned before.
她认为 神经症精神病
What she says about neurosis
不可能完全治愈
is that neurosis never go away completely.
她所说的神经症
And when she says neurosis,
是广义上的定义
she means it in the most,in the broadest sense.
举个例 如果我是个完美主义者
So for example,if I am a perfectionist,
我心里会有一些完美主义思想
I'll always have some perfectionism in me.
春假后 我们会谈这问题
And we'll talk about it after the break.
如果我有焦虑倾向 我永不会成为…
If I am prone to anxiety,I'll never be,you know,
达赖喇嘛 不可能 因为我永远都会焦虑
the Dalai Lama,unlikely.It'll always be there.
它随时可能被任何事激发
And it'll always be potentially triggered by any event.
她说"没关系 那很正常
And she says "that's OK.That's natural.
这是人之常情"我们要接受它
That's human." And we need to accept it.
因为如果我们不接受它
Because if we don't accept it,
我们就会一直感到沮丧
then we'll be constantly frustrated.
因为我们想完全改变
Because we want to change completely,
或是期待我们的伴侣完全改变
or expect our partner to change completely.
这非常困难 不切实际 需要时间 要循序渐进
Very difficult.Unrealistic.It takes time.It's gradual.
我们也需要学习 可以学习享受这过程
We need to also learn.And we can learn to enjoy the process.
19世纪40年代梭罗说过:"我没有看到过
Henry David Thoreau,1840s: "I know of no more encouraging fact
更使人振奋的事实了
than the unquestionable ability of man
人类无疑是有能力来有意识地提高他自己的生命的
to elevate his life by a conscious endeavor.
能画出某一张画
It is something to be able to paint a particular picture,
雕塑出某一个肖像 美化某几个对象 是很了不起的
or to carve a statue,and so to make a few objects beautiful;
但更加荣耀的事是能够塑造或画出
but it is far more glorious to carve and paint
那种氛围与媒介来 从中能使我们发现
the very atmosphere and medium through which we look,
而且能使我们正当地有所为
which morally we can do.
能影响当代的本质的 是最高的艺术"
To affect the quality of the day,that is the highest of arts."
再强调一次 重要的是过程而非结果
Again,it's the process; it's not the outcome that matters more.
结果会让人有短暂快乐
The outcome will lead to a spike
但很快就会回归到基础水平
but will very quickly to go back to our base level.
是进行这些活动的这个过程…
It's the process of actually doing those activities,
事件A B C这些过程让人更快乐
the As,the Bs,and the Cs that will lead to a happier-
而并非完美 并非最快乐 而是更快乐地生活
not perfect,not happiest,but happier life.
需要时间来雕刻出生活的雕像
Over time,it takes time to carve out live statue,
切掉多余的石头
chipping away the excess stone,
破除限制 打造美好的生活
the limitations and building a beautiful life.
这不仅是最高形式的艺术
It is not only the highest of art,
我认为这还是高级的科学
it is also- I would argue,a high science.
那就是心理科学
And that is the science of psychology.
现在我继续往下讲
I want to move on now.Move on and talk about...
等等 好了
One second.Here we go.
我想探讨一个论题
I want to talk about a topic that is related to,
关于整个改变…
very much related to the whole change,
关于整个改变过程的论题
to the whole change process.
那就是设定目标
And that is goal setting.
现在 我问你们 这里有多少人…
Now,question for you: how many people here-
如果你是这样的就举手
put your hand up if this applies to you-
你是否想变得更有效率 更少拖延
do you want to become more efficient and procrastinate less?
是的话 请举手
If it's true for you,put your hand up.
一 二 三 四 五 六…好了
One,two,three,four,five,six...OK.
现在举起你的手
Put your hand up now
如果你希望自己没那么紧张 更冷静
if you want to experience less stress and be calmer,
无论是不是要期末考 好
whether it's during an exam period or not.OK.
一 二…好
One,two...OK.
如果你举过一次手
Now if you put your hand up for one of these questions,
就该留下来
you should stay.
如果你两次都举手
If you put up your hand for both questions,
就不仅要留下来 还要打起精神来听
you should not only stay,you should stay awake.
因为我们接下来的两节课
Because what we are going to talk about of
要谈的是 目标的重要性
the next two classes is the importance of goals
以及目标如何帮我们处理压力
and how they can help us deal with stress,
如何帮我们处理拖延问题
how they can help us deal with procrastination,
我们如何变得更有效率 不是超级有效率
how we can become more efficient- not perfectly so.
两周之后
By the end of the two weeks,
你们不会变成上好油的机器
you are not going to a well-oiled machine.
你们只会变成更快乐的人
You are just going to be a happier human being-
思考很重要
just think is a lot.
因此一开始
So first of all,
我们会探讨目标设定 首先
the topic that we'll talk about under goal setting- first,
理解目标设定的理论及实践
understand the theory and the practice of goal setting:
它的书本意义及社会意义
the Ivory tower and the Main Street of it;
第二 我们怎样处理压力
second,how do we deal with stress-
下节课我们会探讨这个
we'll talk about this in the next class;
最后 我想我们没时间谈这问题
and finally,I don't think we have time for this,
但我还是做了课件
but I'm still leaving up the powerpoints there just
让你们自己看 我在书里有详尽说明的
so you can look at it,and I elaborate on it in the book.
从物质观念到幸福观念
Moving from material perception to happiness perception,
基本上是关于我在我的书里
which is essentially about what I talked about
第七冥想:幸福革命的章节里谈到的
in the last meditation of the book,The Happiness Revolution
以及所发生的内部变革
and the internal revolution that can take place.
我知道你们在放假前没多少时间了
I know you don't have time for before break,
但我还是准备了相关的材料
but you still have the material on it.
我们就从理论和实践开始吧
So let's begin with theory and practice.
我现在想做的仅仅是说服你们
What I want to do now is convince you,very simply,
去设立目标 说服你们这是很重要的
to set goals,convince you that it is important
你们要在作业上写出来
and yet you are going to do it for,your response papers.
你们已经开始这么做
You have already started doing it,
但我真的想让你们明白 作为一种生活方式
but I really want to convince you,as a way of life,
应该不断设定目标
setting goals regularly,
不管是为工作或私生活
whether it's in business,whether in your personal life.
首先 我会试图说服你们
First,I'm going to do it by convince,
向你们展示关于设定目标及工作表现的研究
showing you the research on setting goals
其次就是目标设定与幸福的研究
and performance and second,setting goals and happiness-
它是如何帮助我们赚取社会财富
how it contribute to our success in the conventional  
currency,
以及终极财富
as well as in the ultimate currency.
非常简单 设定目标的人一般…
Quite simply,people who set goals are generally,
掌控其他事都比较成功
controlling for other things,more successful.
为什么?
Why?
一个重要的原因是 因为目标能使我们专注
One of the main reasons is because what goals do is they  
focus us
通常来说
Very often,
我们常四处奔波 不知道往哪个方向走
we are all over the place; we are not sure where we are  
going.
如果我们不知道方向
And if we don't know where we are going,
就不可能到达目的地 而专注能让我们找到方向
we are unlikely to get there.And the focus gets us directed.
00:45:21,760 --&gt; 00:45:24,140
这能带来额外的资源
It brings forth resources-
外部和内部资源 帮助我们达成目的
external and internal resources- that are necessary to get  
there.
Abraham Maslow说:"专注于一个任务可以…
Abraham Maslow: "Being focused on a task produces  
organization
在个体及自然环境中提高组织效率"
for efficiency both within the organism and in the  
environment."
目标的作用非常显著
Quite remarkable how goals actually work.
我们设定目标时 或向自己灌输某种思想时
When we set goals,when we enter something,
无论是私人的还是公开的
whether it's privately but eve better- publicly,
我们心中或身边都会有些什么变化
things begin to happen inside us as well as around us.
而且 目标对工作表现及幸福感有重大影响
Also,goals contribute to performance and well-being
因为目标会让我们更具适应力
because they strengthen our resilience.
还记得第二节课我们探讨过适应力吗?
Remember the second class when we talked about resilience?
那些孩子成功的其中一个要素是
One of the things that extinguish those kids who were  
successful,
排除艰难的外部环境的影响
despite difficult external circumstances,
就是他们的适应性强
was the fact that they were resilient,
其中一个显著特征是
and one of the distinguishing characteristics
他们会设定目标
was they set goals for themselves.
他们是以未来为导向的
They were future-oriented.
不但思考过去 没人帮助他们学习
Not only thinking about the past,being "learned helpless"-
学习适应没人帮助的情况 专注于未来
learning to be helpless,but focusing on the future.
尼采曾写道 只要我们有目标
Nietzsche once wrote that if we have a what for,
一切皆有可能
every how becomes possible.
只要我们有目标 一切皆有可能
When we have the what for,every how becomes possible.And
我们更能克服困难
we are much more likely to overcome difficulties and hardships,
如果我们设定了目标 任务或是我们在意的事
if we have a goal,a mission,something that we care about,
以及我们想实现的事
something that we want to attain.
目标让我们更成功
Goals make us more successful
就跟积极信念发挥作用的原因一样
for the exact same reason that positive beliefs do.
有目标就代表
What we are doing with goals with declaring
我们相信我们会得到某样东西
that we believe we are going to get something.
Roger Bannister宣称
Roger Bannister declared,
他会打破四分钟的纪录
said that he would break the 4 minute barrier.
爱迪生曾说过 到1879年12月31日
Thomas Edison said that by the 31 of December,1879,
他会发明出电灯
he would generate light from electricity.
设定目标有助于成功
Setting goals makes it more likely to come true.
因为我们的思维不喜欢
Because our mind does not like when the reason inconsistency
内部和外部不一致
between what is inside and what is outside.
而希望能相一致
It wants there to be match.
如果我相信一个目标 对外宣告这个目标
And if I believe in a goal and I declare a goal,
那外部事物就会趋向于与这目标相一致
the outside is likely to match that.
但正如我们探讨过的 并不会完全一致
Again,not 100 percent correlation as we've discussed,
但一定更有可能发生
but certainly making it much more likely to happen,
这让我们更容易成功
making us much more likely to be successful.
这个背包是什么?
Now what is the knapsack?
想象一下 你去远足
Imagine the following: you go on a road trip.
你背着一个背包
And you have a knapsack on your back.
你遇到一道墙 一个障碍物
And you reach a wall,a barrier.
你会怎么做?
What do you do? Well,
遇到那道墙时你可以有很多应对方法
there are many things that you can do when you reach that  
wall.
那墙又高又长
And the wall is long and high.
其中一种做法是"太可惜了"然后调头走
One way is to say,"OK,pity" and turn around.
也就是说 避开那道墙
In other words,avoid that wall.
另一种方法是 拿出锤子
Another thing we can do is take out our sledgehammer
试着把它敲碎
and try to break it down.
还有另一种方法是
Another thing that we can do before we do any of the other  
things
把背包扔过墙去
is take our knapsack and throw it over the wall.
把背包扔过墙去
Take our knapsack and simply throw it over the wall.
为什么?因为必需品是发明创造的源泉
Why? Because the necessity is the mother of inventions.
我需要背包来继续 需要我的背包
I need my knapsack to continue.I need my knapsack.
我需要它 而现在它在墙的另一边 我别无选择了
I want it.And now it's over the wall.I have no choice.
但要越过这道墙 要么把它敲碎
But to get over that wall,whether it's by breaking it down,
要么找一条路绕过它 从下方或是上方
whether it's by finding a way around it,under it or over it.
突然间 我会想出几个办法
But suddenly,I will come up with solutions
这些办法都是我之前没想到的
that I have not seen before and this is how it works.
目标起的作用十分显著 而出于同一个原因
It's remarkable- how it works- for the exact same reason
834
当你宣告一个目标 例如"我想买电脑"
that when you declare a goal such as "I want to buy a computer".
那你就会发现到处都是电脑广告
Suddenly you see computer ads all around you,
00:49:23,490 --&gt; 00:49:26,020
你以前从没在这些地方看过电脑广告
whereas before you didn't see computer ads.
或是说你想买某种车
or let's say you want to buy specific car.
一时间 你会发现到处是这种车
Suddenly you see that specific car all around you
你以前从没看过的
while you didn't see it before.
为什么?因为我们一起创造现实
Why? Because we co-create our reality
通过大胆地提出疑问
through our questions to a great extent.
还记得一直在车上的那些孩子吗?
Remember the children on the bus were there all along,
你们没看到他们 直到我设下目标
but you didn't see them until I presented a goal to you
让你们数出车上的孩子数量
which was to count the number of children on the bus
然后孩子们就变得显而易见
And then suddenly it was so clear
就在你眼前
that it was right in front your eyes.
而之前你们就当他们不存在 这就是目标所起的作用
Before,they didn't exist for you.That's what a goal does.
如果我宣布 我要越过这道墙
If I declare that I have to get over the wall,
我的问题就是"要如何越过这道墙"
and my question is "how do I get over this wall".
而不是去想"这是否有可能"
It's not thinking about "is it possible or is it not  
possible".
而是想"我要怎样越过它"
It's rather "how can I get over this wall".
这个问题开启了无数机会
This question opens up opportunities,
有很多是我之前没发现的机会
many of which I have not seen before.
忽然间 车上的孩子就出现在我眼前
Suddenly the children on the bus are right in front of me.
忽然间 墙上的一个洞出现在我眼前
Suddenly a hole in the wall is right in front of me.
忽然间 我看到了一把之前没看到的锤子
Suddenly I see a sledgehammer that I didn't see before,
就在我旁边
right next to me.
必需品是发明创造的源泉
Necessity is the mother of inventions.
如果我们问对了问题 就能开启无数机会
If we ask the right questions,it opens up opportunities.
另一件起作用的东西是 言语的力量
The other thing that's at work here is the power of the  
word:
言语创造世界 要有光
words create worlds.Let there be light.
我们在宗教中看过这典故 上帝说要有光 就有光
We've seen it in religion.And there was light.
言语创造世界
Words create the world.
"约翰福音"中写道:一开始先有言语
Book of John: in the beginning was the word.
但不只在宗教里是如此 看看这伟大的国家
But it's not just in religion.Look at this great country.
美国被宣布存在 言语有其力量
The United States was declared into existence.Words have  
power.
它们有某种意义 尤其是当言语对我们意义重大时
They have meaning,especially when the words are meaningful  
to us
当我们宣布的目标对我们意义重大时
when the goals that we declare are meaningful to us,
就更有可能实现
they are much more likely to come true.
概念和构想之间的关联
The connection between concept and conceive
不仅是语源的 而且还是形而上学的
is not just etymological,it is also metaphysical.
这也是真实的
It is also real.
因为当我们宣告某事 保留某事
Because when we declare something,when we save something,
就更可能成真
it is much more likely to become a reality.
基本上 言语能在我们的脑海里塑造一幅画面
What words do is essentially create an image in our minds,
尤其是我们想象目标时
especially when we imagine the goal.
它在我们脑海中创造一幅画面 而我们并没意识到
It creates an image in our mind and the mind doesn't know
该想象和现实之间的差距
the difference between the imaginary and the real.
我们的思维想让两者统一 目标就是这样起作用
And the mind wants consistency- that is what goals do.
它们让我们更容易让两者统一
They help us create consistency.
现在我念一段摘录
I want to read you an excerpt that,
我在书里谈了很多相关的话题
I talk about many of these things in the book so for some of  
you,
你们可以看看来参考一下
this may be a repetition.
00:52:18,170 --&gt; 00:52:27,410
但现在我要念一段Murray的话
But I want to read you an excerpt from W.H.Murray,
他带领苏格兰探险队前往喜玛拉雅山
who led the Scottish expedition to the Himalayas,
是个成功卓越的登山家
one of those prominent,accomplished climbers of all time,
曾登上珠穆朗玛峰
climbed the Everest.
他说
Here's what he says,
关于他的探险旅程 他写道:
in his writing about the expeditions that he took:
"在所有创造的过程中 都有一个基本真理
"Concerning all acts of creation there is one elementary truth,
对它的忽视使得无数优秀创意和计划夭折
the ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid plans:
那就是一个人一旦全身心投入
That the moment one definitely commits oneself,
就会触动冥冥中的天意
then providence moves too.
很多帮助他实现目标的事
All sorts of things occur to help one
若非这样也不会发生
that would not have otherwise occurred.
这样的决定会带来一系列事件


A whole stream of events issues from the decision,
各种意料之外 对他有所帮助的事件
raising in one's favor all manner of unforeseen incidents
人和事物
and meetings and material assistance
这完全是他之前没有想到的
which no man would have dreamed would come his way.
从歌德的诗文中我有深刻体会:
I have learned a deep respect for one of Goethe's couplets:
'无论你能做什么或梦想什么 去做吧'
'Whatever you can do,or dream you can,begin it!'
勇敢带来智慧 魔力和力量"
Boldness has genius,magic,and power in it."
它为什么会起作用 如何起作用 我们不确定 反正就有用
Why it works,how it works- we are not really sure,but it works.
就像是如果你说要买电脑
Just like when you declare you are looking for computer,
就会看到很多机会
suddenly you see all these opportunities,
投入也是同样的道理
the same with commitments.
我们投入了 很多事就会接踵而来
When we commit,things begin to happen.
我们开始发现外部资源
We begin to identify external resources
以及内部资源
as well as internal resources.
会发现之前没看到的东西
Things that we didn't see before.
因为我的问题变成了"我怎样能成功"
Because my question becomes "how can I succeed".
然后车上的孩子
And then children on the bus
或时钟的时间忽然变得清晰可见
or the time on the clock suddenly become visible to us.
我们有能力成功
And we are able to succeed...
比以前更有可能成功 言语创造世界
Much more likely to succeed than before.Words create worlds.
所以这与成功息息相关 书上有写
So this is about success.Very well documented.
你们的一些阅读材料与之相关
Some of your readings are related to this.
从整体上设定目标 且从其他方面实现目标的人
People who set goals generally,controlling from other factors,
更成功 无论是工作方面
are more successful,whether it's in business,
还是个人生活方面 目标至关重要
whether it's in other personal lives.Goals matter.
他们不仅对"硬通货"重要
They don't just matter though for the "hard currency".
对"终极财富"也很重要
They also matter for the "ultimate currency"-
也就是幸福
the currency of happiness.
被正确理解的目标
Goals properly understood,
被正确理解的目标会让人幸福
goals properly understood,lead to happiness.
这里我强调"被正确理解"
And I emphasize "properly understood".
为什么?因为我们知道实现目标
Why? Because we know that attaining goals,
实现目标本身
the attainment of goals does not in
并不会带来幸福
and of itself lead to happiness.
没错 得到职位我会有短暂的幸福
Yes,getting tenure will lead to a spike of my well being,
但很快我就会回归基础水平
but very quickly I'll go back to my base level.
中了彩票或是赚大钱或…
Winning a lottery or making a lot of money,or getting a,
升职 都会让我短暂地感到快乐
or getting promoted at work will lead to a spike in my well being
但不会带来长期的持续的幸福
but it will not lead to long lasting happiness.
我们知道那是短暂的快乐
So that's temporary- we know that.
因此我们知道实现目标不会带来幸福
So we know that attainment of goals does not lead to happiness.
那什么能带来幸福?
What does lead to happiness?
充分理解目标的正确作用
Understanding the proper role of goals.
要明白到
And understanding that
不是实现目标带来幸福
it's not the attaining of a goal that leads to happiness,
而是拥有目标让人幸福
but the having of a goal that leads to happiness.
两年前 我教积极心理学
So two years ago,when I taught positive psychology,
一个非常重要的学者出了本书
a book came out by very important scholar
关于幸福的书 他是达赖喇嘛的左右手
in the area of happiness,who's the Dalai Lama's right hand man.
他就是翻译家Ricardo Matthieu
He's translator,Ricardo Matthieu.
推出一本关于幸福的好书
Wonderful book on happiness came out.
我们在Williams James大楼展开了一场辩论
And we,in Williams James Hall 1,engaged in a debate-
那是一次哈佛学生和全体教职员的全体活动
was an event for Harvard students and faculty.
我们参与了辩论 题为"幸福:东方与西方"
And we engaged in a debate- "Happiness: East and West".
我们很多意见不谋而合
And we agreed on many things-
你们知道 我经常冥想
as you know,I meditate regularly,
我当然非常认同
and certainly believe
佛教心理学的力量
in the power of a lot of the Buddhist psychology.
然而 我们对目标的意见不一致
However,the one thing that we disagreed on was goals.
我们意见有分歧
That's the one thing we disagree.
因为在佛教方面 根据很多说法
Because in Buddhism,according to many of the  
interpretations-
不是全部 但很多说法认为
not all,many of the interpretations,
我们想实现的状态是身外无物
the state we want to reach is a state of non-attachment.
那个状态中 我们不会想要拥有身外之物
A state where we will not have something external that we want,
渴望的东西
that we desire,
也不会有现在的这个课程
that we will be completely present in the here and now.
我想或许那是个非常理想的状态
Now I think it's a wonderful ideal perhaps,
但我一直认为 那是不现实的
but what I argued and what I still argue is that it's unrealistic
作为人类 我不认为
As human beings,I do not believe-
经过30年来每天八小时的冥想
maybe after 30 years of meditating for 8 hours a day, possible-
我不相信我们能实现那种
but I do not believe that we can reach a state
身外无物的状态
where we are not attached.
设定目标是与外界关联的一个例子 因为
And setting goals is an example of attachment.Because
当我说想赢这场比赛 或我想这门课考试优秀
when I say I want to win this championship or I want to get an A-
或我想在银行找份工作
in this course or I want to get a job in this bank,
这些就是确切的目标
this is a goal which means by definition
让我与结果联系起来
that I'm attached to the outcome.
如果我没与结果联系起来 我就不会在乎 它就不重要
If I wasn't attached,if I didn't care then,it wouldn't matter.
我觉得这不仅对成功很重要
And I think it's not only important for success,
对幸福也很重要
it is also important for happiness.
因此我不能认同
So that's where I differ to a great extent
佛教的说法
from some of the Buddhist interpretations
他们认为身外无物是种无欲无求的状态
on non-attachment of being in a desire-less state.
然而我们有着相似的看法
However,where we are similar in our understanding
专注于当下
is the focus on the present.
被正确理解的目标的作用是
Goals properly understood their role
解放我们 让我们享受当下
is to liberate us to enjoy the present.
这意味着什么?例如你去远足
What does this mean? Let's say you go off on a road trip.
你不知道自己要去哪
And you have no idea where you are going.
你没目标 心中没有方向
You don't have a goal.You don't have a destination in mind.
你就不大可能
You are less likely rather than more likely,
不大可能享受旅程
less likely to enjoy the journey.
因为每分钟你都在左顾右盼
Because every minute you'll look left or right or ahead
不知道是否错过什么
to see if you are not falling over the stage;
如果你知道要去哪
whereas if you know where you are going,
你有方向感
you have a sense of direction.
你就被解放了
You are liberated.
你就更可能享受旅程
You are much more likely to enjoy the process,
才可以欣赏到路边的鲜花
the flower on the side as well.
想想你们的生活 有些时期里不知道何去何从
Think about your lives- periods that you have no idea,
对你们很多人来说 此刻就是这样
or for many of you,I know,it's happening right now.
你不知道明年会去哪
You have no idea where you are going next year.
目前对大多数人来说 还是没关系
Now for a while,for most people,it's OK.It's fine.
但一阵子后 你想知道要去哪里
But after a while,you want to know where you are going.
因为当你专注于某事
Because when you are immersed in something,
你就会有更清晰的方向感
you have a clearer sense of direction.
你更容易开心
You are much more likely to be happy,
这就能解释 为什么很多人退休后
which explains why so many people,when they retire,
变得不大开心
become less happy,
尽管他们多年来一直期待着退休
even though they've been dreaming of being retired for many years
到他们真的退休后 就变得闷闷不乐
When they actually retire,they become less happy.
那些退休后更开心的人
The ones who are happier when they retire are the ones
为自己设定了目标
who actually set goals for themselves,
或是上一门课 或是学新知识
whether it's taking a class,whether it's learning something new,
或是和亲人朋友相处更久
whether it's spending more time with family and friends,
他们都有一个目标
but they have a goal,
而不是"让我们享受生活吧 顺其自然"
as opposed to "let's just enjoy ourselves; let's just be".
我们需要目标 结果 未来的导向
We need that goal- this outcome,this future orientation,
那样我们就能更享受此刻
so that we can enjoy the present more.
目标让我们得到解放 才能享受当下
The goals liberate us to enjoy the here and now.
换言之
In other words,
00:59:56,160 --&gt; 01:00:01,
如果你仔细想想 目标是一种手段
if you think about it,the role of goals is actually means.
它们是达到结果的一种手段
They are means toward an end,
结果就是当下的体验
and the end are the present experiences.
再次强调 目标本身
Again,the goals in themselves,
如我们所说的 并不能让我们感到更幸福
as we said,as we discussed,will not make us happier,
01:00:15,060 --&gt; 01:00:20,730
无论我们是否能实现这目标
whether attaining of the goal or failing to attain the goal.
我们会经历人生起伏
We'll be on the ups and downs,the vicissitudes.
但如果我们想要基础水平 此刻就是了
But if we want the base level- the base level is the here and now
当下 就是这过程
The present.It's the process.
是我们正经历着的旅程 而不是结果
It's the journey that we're living mostly,not the outcome.
在书中一开始的地方
When I start the book,
我谈及 冠军赛会让我开心
I talk about thinking this rally championship would make me  
happy
的确让我开心了四小时 但之后我又回到基础水平
And it did.For 4 hours.And then back again to base level.
获得终身职位的教授以为
Professors who get tenures think that is
这事会让他们余生都快乐
what would make them happy for the rest of their lives-
那个目标的实现
the attainment of that goal.
其实不然
It doesn't.
他们回到了幸福的基础水平
They go back to base level of happiness,
无论他们是否实现了这个目标
whether they get it,or don't get it.
关键是学习 享受这个过程
The key is to learn,to enjoy the process.
目标的其中一个作用是解放我们
And one of the roles of the goals is to liberate us
那样我们就能享受这个过程
so that we can enjoy the process.
目标是获得结果的手段
Goals are means toward the present end,
这与许多目标理论背道而驰
which is taking a lot of goal theory and turning it around.
这解释了为什么如此多的成功者不快乐
This explains why so many high achievers are unhappy.
这也解释了为什么如此多的成功者
This explains why so many high achievers
沉沦于药品及酒精
turn to drugs and to alcohol.
如今这样的人比以前更多
By the way,today even more so than in the past-
也许是如今我们了解得更多
maybe today we know about it more than in the past.
他们常进心理治疗中心
Going into rehab centers constantly.
那样进进出出
Coming out and going back.
我们问"为什么会这样?"
And we ask ourselves,"why? How could it be?"
表面上看那些人似乎已得到一切
Those people who seemingly have it all.
似乎已得到一切
Who seemingly have it all.
名声 财富 美人 他们想要的任何人
Fame.Fortune.Beauty.Anyone they want.
大部分人梦寐以求的生活
The life that most people in the world dream about.
为什么他们最后还要进心理治疗中心?
How come they end up in a rehab center?
为什么会不开心?现在就来说说原因
How come they are unhappy? Here's the how come.
多年来 他们不断努力向上
You see,for years,when they climb up the ranks,
他们心怀梦想 希望成为名人
when they have the dream of becoming a famous person,
渴望得到别人的尊敬
a person who is admired,revered,
渴望得到一切想要的东西或人
a person who can get anything or anyone almost they want,
当他们梦想这些的时候 他们可能是不开心
when they dream about it,they may be unhappy.
但他们对自己说
But they say to themselves,
"好吧 我现在不开心 但我成功后会很开心"
"OK.I'm unhappy now,but I'll be happy when I get there."
然后他们成功了
And then they get there.
他们意识到并没有料想中的开心
And they realize that there's no "there" there.
他们以为那会让他们开心 但没有
They think it would make them happy,but it doesn't.
那时真正的问题才到来
And that's when the real problems begin.
因为到那时他们才开始体会到无助
Because that's when they begin to experience helplessness.
那时他们就会放弃
That's when they become resigned.
那时他们就变得…根据Hamburger的模型
That's when they go into- on the Hamburger model,
他们会患上习得性无助
that's when they go into the learned helplessness
自我放弃和怀疑主义
and resignation and the nihilism.
因为大家都跟他们说
Because everyone has told them
他们实现了这事就会快乐
that once they make it then they'll be happy.
而他们也对自己说过"一实现了这事 就会快乐"
And they told themselves,"once I make it then I'll be happy".
但他们并不为此而更快乐
And they are not any happier for it.
一开始 当刚开始有点名气
Yeah,initially when the fame begins,
他们刚开始走上成功之路
and when they start having things in their way
他们常常梦想成功 当然就会快乐一点
as they always dream,of course they are happier.
但之后他们又回到基础水平
But then they go back to their base level.
当回到基础水平 他们很压抑
And when they go to their base level,they are suppressed,
很沮丧 失望
they are upset,they are disappointed,
更甚的是 他们很害怕
and more than anything,they are scared.
因为不知道怎么办好 但在那之前
Because what now? Until that point,
他们以一种希望支撑着 想着成功后
they were sustained by their hope that when they get there,
他们会很快乐 但他们并没有更快乐
they'll be happy,but they are not happier.
他们很害怕 很迷茫
And they are scared.And they are lost.
他们想寻找解决方法
And they look for solutions,
通常就会脱离正常经验
very often outside of the normal experiences,
脱离常规生活
outside of ordinary life.
那有什么解决方法呢? 常常就是药品和酒精
And where is that? That very often is with drugs and with alcohol
因为那让我们远离枯燥乏味的…
Because that takes us out of our normal day-to-day,
日常生活 无论是好的或坏的
ordinary lives.For good and ill.
这种错误的想法非常普遍 大部分人都如此
This misunderstanding prevalent and most people live that way.
他们认为…这就是为什么
And they think- and this is why
这么多人会经历中年危机
so many people go through mid-life crisis for example.
这不是唯一的原因 却是其中一个原因
It's not the only reason.But it's one of the reasons.
因为有很多非常成功的人
Because there are many people who are pretty accomplished,
他们成功后会说
who have nailed it,and then they say,
"那现在怎么办?这就是它带来的快乐吗?"
"what now? Is this all the raise to it?"
是的 它就只能带来这么多快乐 而面临的难题是
Yes,this is all the raise to it.And the challenge
去找出埋藏起来的幸福宝藏
is to identify the treasure of happiness that are embedded,
它就在我们身边
that are there in the it and that are there all around us.
幸福并不在于我们的地位
Again,happiness is not contingent on our status
或银行存款的多少
or the state of our bank account.
它与我们的思维状态有关
It's contingent on our state of mind,
就视乎我们如何看待自己的现状 以及我们专注于何事
of how we interpret our reality,of on what we choose to focus on
想变得更快乐 当下更重要
And to be happier is the present that matters much more.
引用我书中的话:
Quote from my book:
"幸福并不是登上山峰
"Happiness is not about making it to the peak of the mountain,
也不是在山的四周没有方向地乱爬
nor is it about climbing aimlessly around the mountain;
幸福是向山峰攀登的过程"
happiness is the experience of climbing toward the peak."
它与设定目标有关
It is about having a goal.
与设定一个终点有关
It is about having a destination in mind,
然后就释放自己 享受过程
and then letting go and enjoying the process.
有很多人和我谈过这问题
You know there are many people who talk to me about it,
每次我都会经历同样的情况
and again I went through the exact same experience.
"接下来我要做什么工作呢?"
So OK "what is going to be the next job that I take?"
"我该走哪一条路呢?"
"What is going to be the path that I take?"
当他们选了一条路 通常都会后悔
And once they take a path,it is very often they regret,
"我应该走另一条路"应该接这一份工作
"I should've taken the other path." Should've taken this job.
不该去那里 我的回答通常是 这并不重要
Should've gone there.And my response to it is it doesn't matter.
对终极财富来说 并不重要
It doesn't,in the ultimate currency,it doesn't matter.
因为如果我接了一份应该做的工作
Because,yeah,let's say I am at a job that I should have taken
我会非常成功
and I would be very successful there.Fine.
当我非常成功 我会很开心
I would enjoy a high when I became very successful.
但那件事并不会让我开心
But that in and of itself would not make me happy.
关键是设定目标
The key is to have the goal.
关键是自身的投入
The key is to have the commitment
对正在做的事的投入
to whatever it is that I'm doing.
就算那种投入每三天变一次也没关系
Now that commitment may change every three days and that's OK.
设定目标 全心投入才是最重要的
It's the having the goals,having that commitment that Nmatters.
如果你选择某条路 却又后悔了
So if you chose certain path and now you regret it,
记住 这不重要的
remember,it really doesn't matter.
走哪条路你都可以开心的 只要你投入了
You can be as happy in both paths as long as you are committed.
因为当我们投入其中
Because when we are committed,
就能享受这旅程
that's when we can enjoy the journey.
而我们投入于何事并不重要
Doesn't matter as much what it is that we are committed to,
当然必须是道德的事
provided of course that is moral
不能伤害他人
and it's not about hurting others,
因为那样的话 最终不但会伤害他人
which ultimately doesn't just hurt others-
也会伤害到我们自己
it also hurts ourselves.
David Watson在"积极心理学手册"里说
David Watson in "The Handbook of Positive Psychology":
"当代研究学者强调
"Contemporary researchers emphasize
追寻目标的过程
that it is the process of striving after goals—
而不是目标的实现
rather than goal attainment per se—
才是实现幸福的关键"
that is crucial for happiness and positive affectivity."
该领域的主要研究学者
And finally,two of the leading researchers in the field,
David Myers和Ed Diener说:"幸福感…
David Myers and Ed Diener: "Happiness grows less
在理想情况下的消极体验中的增长
from the passive experience of desirable circumstances
比在有价值的活动
than from involvement in valued activities
以及实现目标的过程中的增长要少"
and progress toward one goal."
这有一首优美的诗
Here is a beautiful poem
由Gwendolyn Brooks所写的:
that I think captures by Gwendolyn Brooks:
"不为胜利而活 不为曲终而活
"Live not for battles won / Live not for the-end-of-the-song
为美好过程而活"任何目标都并不重要
/ Live for the along." It's not any goals that matter.
并不是所有目标都一样
It's not any goals that...Not all goals are created equal.
就我们当下所处的境况来说
And here's what we do get to a place
思考你的目标非常重要
where it's important to think about your goals.
没错 投入是最重要的
Yes,the commitment is the most important,
但有某些目标是比其他更好的
but there are certain goals that are better than others:
简单地说 自我和谐的目标
self-concordant goals,very briefly,
在你们的阅读材料里有写 是最根本的目标
because -it's in your readings- are essentially goals that
和你的个人兴趣和价值观
are aligned with your personal interests and values-
还有你在乎的东西相融合
things that you care about.
做对你来说重要的事
Doing things that are important to you.
举个例 就读医学预科 是因为
So for example,doing premed because
你想要当医生 救死扶伤
what you really really want to be is a doctor and treat people.
学习经济学是因为市场让你着迷
Studying economics because the market fascinates you.
你想做与之有关的工作
And you want to engage in work that relates to it.
你对它充满了激情
You are passionate about it.
参加学生组织
Joining a student organization,
是因为你认同他们的使命
because you believe in their mission.
融合你的个人兴趣
Aligned with your personal interests,
和你的价值观 热诚
with your values,with your passion.
这些目标是你自由选择的
These are goals that you choose freely,
而不是由外界所强加的
not goals that are imposed from the outside
不是由某个特定的人
whether it's by someone specific or specific people,
或抽象意义上的社会所强加在你身上
or by abstract society.
不是因为义务或责任而做
And doing it out of a sense of obligation or duty.
而是去做你内心深处最在意的事
It's to do things that you care about deeply from within.
换句话说 这些是你想做的事
In other words,these are things that you want to do,
或是你感到 察觉到自己想做的事
or that you feel,that you perceive that you want to do,
而不是你不得不做的事
rather than things that you have to do.
我的老师Ohad Kamin 在我大学毕业时
My teacher Ohad Kamin,when I graduated from college,
我不知道何去何从
and I was debating- I didn't know which direction to go,
而我的老师给我说了这话:
said to me the following- he said:
"这是一个50岁的人给你的建议"他当时50岁
"here is the advice from a 50 year old." - He was 50 at the time.
他说"找出你能做的事
He said,"Identify the things that you can do.
然后再从中找出你想做的事
And then out of those,identify the things that you want to do.
把它们一一写下来
And list them down.
写张清单 长短都无所谓
Make a list- long or short,whatever it is.
接着从你想做的事中
Now out of the things you want to do,
找出你最想做的事
identify those things that you really want to do.
看着这些 从中找出…
And then look at them,and out of those things,identify those
你最最想做的事 然后就做那些事"
that you really really want to do and then do them."
那是我得到过的最好的建议
One of the best advices that I got.
非常简单 但非常重要
Very simple.But so important.
这需要花点时间 认真想想这些事
Again it's to take time aside and to think about those things.
那我的自我和谐目标是什么呢?我的兴趣是什么?
So what are my self-concordant goals? What is the interest of me?
什么对我最具价值?我对什么有激情?
What is valuable to me? What am I passionate about?
我想做什么 而不是我得做什么
What do I want to rather than feel that I have to do?
有时答案并不简单
And sometimes the answers are not easy answers.
有时答案并不中听
Sometimes the answers are not answers that I want to hear.
而其中的含义…
And the implications,the ? that are following
接下来的路可能没有最初的好走
that path may not be as pleasant initially,
因为它越来越崎岖不平
because it made me going against the grain.
它让我去做一些困难的事情
It made me doing something that
别人或环境所造成的困难
yields difficulties from other people or from the environment.
可能不是最受欢迎的选择
It may not be the most popular choice.
我在书里谈到的一个问题是
One of the things that I talk about in the book –
我认为幸福的重要组成部分
I think it's such an important component of happiness,
是精神性
is spirituality.
字典对精神性的定义是
Now the dictionary definition of spirituality is-
其中一个定义是
one of the definitions
对有重大意义的事情的感知
is the real sense of significance of something.
因此如果我发现一些极具意义 极其重要的东西
So if I see something as significant,as important,
意义非凡的 我就对它有种精神性体验
as meaningful,I'm having a spiritual experience engaging in it.
那什么对我意义重大呢?什么对我重要?
So what is significant to me? What is important to me?
要记住
And the thing to keep in mind is that
选择什么 往哪个方向走并不重要
it doesn't matter what I choose,what direction I go in.
如果我选择的东西是自我和谐的
If I choose something that is self-concordant,
和我个人的目标和使命相符合
that is aligned with my personal goals and mission,
我就会过上精神性生活
I will lead a spiritual life.
事实上 一个投资银行家
In fact,an investment banker
从事投资银行业的最合适理由
who goes into investment banking for the right reasons,
是因为他或她在乎这工作
because he/she cares about this work.
因为他们认为这是重要的 因为他们乐在其中
Because they think it's important,because they enjoy it.
因为他们喜欢和数字打交道
Because they love dealing with numbers
喜欢那种刺激感
and having the adrenaline rush.
没错 他们真的享受这工作
And yes,they are people who truly enjoy it.
如果他们是因合适的理由而去做这份工作
If they go in for the right reasons,
那他们就会比一个…
they will lead a much more spiritual life than a monk
不虔诚的僧人有更好的精神生活
who goes into the order for the wrong reasons.
当然 反之亦然
And of course,vice versa.
无论我们选择什么 自我和谐目标
Whatever we choose,the self-concordant goals-
我真的相信
and I truly believe it,
世界会变得更美好
that the world will become a better place,
不仅是个别地方会变得更美好
not just individualized will become a better place,
如果人们追求他们的热情所在 他们的自我和谐目标
if people pursue their passions,their self-concordant goals.
说比做容易
Easier said than done.
"实现自我和谐是非常困难的
"Becoming self concordant is a difficult skill,
要求精确的自我知觉能力
requiring both accurate self-perceptual abilities
还有抵抗社会压力的能力
and the ability to resist social pressures
那种压力有时会把人迫往错误的方向"
that may sometimes push one in inappropriate directions."
我们要参与到这些活动当中
And we need to engage in these activities.
为什么?因为人生苦短 人生…抱歉
Why? Because life is short.Life is short.Life is...Sorry.
"人生短得完成不了我必须做的事
"Life is too short to do what I have to do;
人生的长度仅够我完成我想做的事"
it's barely long enough to do what I want to do."
越早开始我们想做的事越好
The sooner we start on the want-to,the better.
这不代表你不能对自己说
This does not mean that you can't say to yourself like,
"我最想的就是自己做生意
"well my real passion is starting my own business.
为了筹集资金 我会先当顾问
And in order to get the foundation,I will work as a consultant
或是投资银行家两年"这么说没问题
or an investment banker for two years." Nothing wrong with that.
非常好
Perfectly fine.
就算你的兴趣不是一周工作80小时
Even though it's not your passion working 80 hours a week
处理些电子文档 也没关系
in front of an Excel sheet.That's OK.
有时我们需要延迟满足
Sometimes we need to delay gratification.
危险在于
The danger is that
我们的整个人生常处于这种延迟满足的状态
we enter this delayed gratification state for our entire lives.
那就成了一条糟糕的路
And that becomes the red-race (?) path.
这是我们要意识到的
And that is what we need to be aware of.
我们需要记住的
This is what we need to keep in back of our mind.
我想为你们展示一个视频选段
I want to show you a quick video excerpt
选自我最喜欢的一部电影《死亡诗社》
from one of my favorite movies,Dead Poet Society,
Robin Williams谈及
where Robin Williams talks about the importance of identifying
定义我们想做的事的重要性
what it is that we were meant to do with our lives,
换言之 就是我们的自我和谐目标
in other words,our self-concordant goals.
(死亡诗社电影片段)
(Video clips from Dead Poet Society with captions on the screen)
那么抓紧时间 做你想做的事吧
Dr.Tal Ben-Shahar:So carpe diem (seize the day).Do what you want.
