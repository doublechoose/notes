幸福课 中英字幕 [第3课]幸福是一种随机现象吗？
早上好 同学们Good morning,everyone.今天是本学期正式开学的第一天This semester has started,officially today.很高兴在这看到你们Glad to see you here.我只想说几句话Just a couple of announcement还有向进修学院的同学们打声招呼and also hi to the extension school students.上次我们向新西兰的同学问好Last time we say hi to New Zealand.今天轮到爱尔兰的同学了Today we are saying hi to Ireland.现在先说这里的本科生和研究生In terms of sectioning分组问题for the undergrads and graduate students here,你们明天会收到Sean Achor的邮件you'll get an email from Sean Achor tomorrow.你们填好各自的想加入的小组And you'll put in your section preference.我们本周会分好小组We are sectioning this weekend.选择你最想加入的组非常重要So it will be important that you submit your top preferences.下周我们就开始And next week we are starting.还记得上节课的问题吗Last time,if you remember the question that we ask,最主要的问题是"为什么要学习积极心理学?"the guiding question was "why positive psychology?"我提到了三个原因And I mentioned three reasons,为何我们把它作为独立的研究 而不简单地Why we need it as an independent field as opposed to just being"研究一下幸福和爱情""well,let's do some studies on happiness,on relationships"不像一贯人们所做的那样?as it is always being done?我们需要积极心理学是为了改变The reason why we need positive psychology is to shift现在的21比1这个比率the pendulum from the 21:1 ratio that we have today:每有一项关于抑郁或焦虑的研究for every one study on depression or anxiety,就有21项 对不起we have 21 studies on-- sorry,应该是每有一项关于快乐或幸福的研究for one study on happiness or wellbeing,就有21项关于抑郁或焦虑的研究we have 21 studies on depression and anxiety.我们想稍微改变这个比率We want to shift the pendulum slightly.我提过三个原因And I mentioned three reason关于为什么要改变这个比率why we want to shift this pendulum despite the fact尽管世界上越来越多人抑郁that there are rising levels of depression around the world,而焦虑就像是全球性流行病that anxiety has become epidemic globally—遍布美国 中国 澳大利亚 英国所有大学on college campuses in United States,China,Australia,UK.尽管如此 我还是认为我们该改变那比率Despite that fact,I argue that we need to shift the pendulum做更多"积极研究" 或者说and do more "positive research",or in other words,集中研究可行的事research that focuses on what works.原因在于And the reason is—我们之前讨论完的第一个原因是the first reason that we gave and we are just finishing up is我们提出的问题很重要because the question that we ask,无论它是不是我们的研究问题whether it's the research questions that we ask,或我们为自己所问的or the questions that we ask of ourselves,或为我们的伴侣问的or our partners,matter.如果我们只问同一类问题And if our only questions,或只是问"有哪些不如意的事?or primarily our questions are "what is not working?出什么问题了?What is the problem?为什么那么多孩子因为成长环境而堕落?"Why are so many kids failing as a result of their circumstances?"如果我们只问了这些问题If we only ask these questions,就会错过现实中很重要的部分we will miss,literally miss an important part of reality,像你们在练习中没看到公车上的孩子一样just like you missed the children on the bus in the exercise.你们大多数人都没看到Most of you did.如果我们也问积极问题And if we also ask the positive question,那就会出现新的可能性 新的探索then some new possibilities,new quests open up,就像他们对研究学者所问的一样just like they did for the researchers when they started to ask不再问"为什么有这么多人堕落?"no longer "why do so many individuals fail?"而问"那些人是怎样取得成功的?but started to ask "what do some individuals do and succeed?为什么有些人能成功Why do some individuals succeed即使成长环境恶劣?"despite the unfavorable circumstances?"我们会以Marva Collins的故事为例And then we have the story of Marva Collins,她的例子很典型 能说明很多观点who exemplifies so many of themes这些观点会贯穿我们整节课that we'll talk about throughout the course.Marva Collins所做的What Marva Collins did就是帮助她的学生从消极的受害者-was help her students shift from the passive victim—你是成长环境的受害者you are victims of your circumstances,是你的家庭教育 邻里关系 和社会环境的受害者of your upbringing,neighborhood,country,诸如此类的 从消极的受害者变成积极的作用者whatever it is—from a passive victim to an active agent.00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,790是的 那很困难 艰辛 不公平Yes,it's difficult. It's tough. It's unfair.但这是你自己的责任 没人会来帮你However,it's your responsibility. No one is coming.能否改变自己的人生 由你自己决定It's up to you to make that difference in your life.但她改变了千千万万人的人生And she made a difference to thousands of people's lives现在还在这么做and continues to do so.换句话说 如果我们看看芝加哥学院体制In other words,if we look at the case of Chicago school systemMarva Collins就在那体制下执教where Marva Collins was teaching,the conventional,还是那个老问题traditional question was-- if you remember—"怎样才能让学生们在学校"how can we keep these students in school留得久一点?for as long as possible?如何让他们在10或12岁后还留在学校How can we keep them in school beyond the age of 10 or 让他们远离街头帮派?so that they don't join street gangs?让他们远离毒品和犯罪?"So that they are not hurt by drugs or crime?""如何使他们安全地留在学校?""How can we keep them safe at school?"—这是个很重要的问题 但还不只如此An important question to ask. However,not enough.Marva Collins重新定义这个问题Marva Collins comes along and reframes the question.她提出的问题是And her question becomes"我们如何培养学生 激发他们的潜能?""how can we cultivate the seed of greatness in our student?"这问题改变了一切And that,once again,made all the difference,因为她看到了每个学生的潜能because she saw the seed of greatness in each student.她看到每个学生身上的优点和品德She saw the strength,the virtues in each single student.潜能 优点 品德 能力A seed,a strength,a virtue,a competence这些是其他老师没看到的that other teachers did not see,因为他们没提出这个问题because they did not ask this question;打个比方 他们只会问because they asked,metaphorically speaking,"你在屏幕上看到多少个几何图案?""how many geometric shapes do you see on the screen?"他们完全忽略了车上的孩子And they completely missed the children on the bus.完全忽略了学生的潜能They completely missed the seed of greatness.如果我们看不见学生的潜能And when we don't see the seed of greatness,不去栽培它when we don't water it and shed a light on it,它就会枯萎而死it withers and dies,遗憾的是 大部分人类潜能都因此而被磨灭which is unfortunately the fate of most human potential.无论在哪 这都是大部分人类潜能的遭遇Wherever we go,that is the fate of most human potential—人与人之间 很多团体中interpersonally,relationships,in most organizations,很多大学里或人们自己 这些潜能都因被忽视而磨灭in most universities,in most individuals.疑问引起改变Questions make a difference,因此提问是非常重要的which is why it is also important to ask提出积极心理学的问题很重要the positive psychology question,也就是"健康创成"的问题which is the salutogenic question:"健康源于什么?成功源于什么?"What is source of health? What is the source of success?幸福源于什么?"What is the source of wellbeing?"这是第一个原因 而第二个原因是So that's the first reason. The second reason—在谈第二个原因时before I go to the second reason,如果Marva Collins今天在场if Marva Collins is here today,那她会问我们这个问题:here's the question she would be asking us:"我们如何在于自身和家人中"How can we cultivate the seed of greatness栽培伟大的种子in ourselves and families,如何在在社区和团体中 栽培伟大的种子in our communities and organizations,在国家和世界中呢"in our nation and in our world?"当我们提出这个极为重要的问题When we ask this question-- this very important question,就会看到之前没看到的潜能suddenly we see possibilities that we didn't see before.第二个研究积极心理学的原因Second reason for having positive psychology's field of study研究可行的事和and focusing on what works and focusing on研究快乐 人际关系 幸福的原因research in happiness,relationships and wellbeing是因为幸福不会因为驱除了忧愁is because happiness does not spontaneously rise而自动增长when take unhappiness away.幸福与忧愁 快乐与紧张Now happiness and unhappiness,or happiness and neurosis,精神病与抑郁 都有很大的内在联系psychosis and depression,are interconnected,of course.要快乐并不容易It's very difficult to be happy如果我们感觉很压抑或焦虑if we are experiencing severe depression or anxiety.就是说他们必然是有关联的 然而So they are certainly interconnected. However,单单摆脱焦虑与压抑并不会just getting rid of the anxiety and the depression will not in使我们快乐and of itself make us happy,这一点算是传统的常识which is the conventional wisdom today,是很多从业的心理学家which is the conventional wisdom会了解的一点常识of many psychologists practicing psychologies—131"摆脱抑郁"Well,let's just get rid of that depression一切都会变好的"and everything will be fine."事实并非如此It won't.解释这一点的一个例子是The analogy to explain this is think about享受美食的能力the ability to enjoy food.美味大餐A gourmet meal.如果我们消化不良 那很难享受美食Now if we have indigestion,it's very difficult to enjoy food.因此我们得先治好消化不良So yes,we first need to get rid of the indigestion.然而 治好消化不良However,that in and of itself不保证我们就能享受美食does not guarantee us that we enjoy food.要享受美味大餐 就得出去吃We have to go out and eat the gourmet food to enjoy it.只是治愈消化不良远远不够Just getting rid of indigestion is not sufficient.还要做好下一步的事We need the next step.可以从多方面来看我们的经验In many ways you can look at most of our experiences,在心理连续谱上看有效心理经验psychological effective experiences on a continuum,有时候会跌倒0以下where some of them fall below the zero,不愉快或痛苦的经历the negative experiences or the painful experiences积极或愉快的经历and the positive or the pleasurable experiences分别在0与正值之间between the zero and the positive.紧张 愤怒 焦虑 压抑 精神病Neurosis,anger,anxiety,depression,psychosis—这些消极和痛苦的方面to name a few-- on the negative side,the painful side;幸福 满足 愉悦 兴奋 快乐wellbeing,satisfaction,joy,excitement,happiness属于另一方面on the other side也就是积极心理学研究的方面which is the side of positive psychology studies.再强调一次 摆脱消极Again,getting rid of the negative不能保证我们变得积极does not guarantee us the positive,因此早在19世纪40年代which is why already in the 1840s,梭罗David Henry Thoreau (should be Henry David Thoreau),认为 大多数人都活在沉默的压抑中wrote that most men lead lives of quiet desperation.这是没错的It's Ok. There's nothing really wrong.但平克弗洛伊德说过But it's just somewhere there in the words of Pink Floyd"人们在舒适地麻木" 舒适地麻木"people are comfortably numb". Comfortably numb.还不止如此 我们要怎样摆脱这种"舒适地麻木"?Not enough. How can we get beyond that "comfortably numb"?要怎样摆脱"沉默的压抑"?How can we get beyond that "quiet desperation"?得到振奋 快乐 幸福?To excitement,to joy,to happiness?为了达到这目的 我们需用心经营这些情感因素In order to do that,we need to cultivate these traits.再说一次 幸福不会自动出现Once again,they don't spontaneously emerge并不是没有痛苦就能感到幸福once the painful experiences go away.因此我们才需要积极心理学And that is why we need positive psychology.积极心理学本质上就是健康模型Positive psychology essentially focuses on the health model,健康本源学Salutogenesis.健康 生理 心理 情感之源是什么?What is the source of health,physical,psychological,emotional?我们如何让人们从智力上 情感上How do we get people to flourish,intellectually,emotionally,心理上 人际关系上 人格上全面发展?psychologically,interpersonally,intra-personally?我们如何让他们全面发展 而不仅仅是帮他们摆脱How do we get them to thrive beyond just getting rid生活中不如意的事?of what is not working in their lives?根据该模型 我们在许多层面上都走了极端And under that model we see,to extremes on many levels.第一个层次:Here,the first level:我们是否重视缺点do we focus on weaknesses,也就是疾病模型所说的我们要摆脱的缺点which is the disease model,say let's get rid of weaknesses?或者说 我们是否专注于优点?Or do we focus on strength?当你问别人这个问题While you ask people this question,盖洛普组织做了这项研究and this was done by the Gallup organization.一项全球民意调查显示A poll-- global poll,无论是在日本 中国 美国或欧洲whether it's in Japan,China,United States or Europe:大多数人认为 如果要成功most people think that it's more important注重自己的缺点比优点更重要to focus on their weaknesses if they are to succeed.大错特错Big mistake.那些同样注重自己优点的人The people who focus primarily,not only-- remember the "also"—改变那个比率的人 更注重优点的人who shift the pendulum,who focus more on their strength,不仅更开心 从长远来看他们也are not only happier,they are also,on the long run,更成功more successful.这同样适用于领导能力It applies to leadership as well.积极心理学认为 我们至少Positive psychology says let's focus also注重优点的程度要和注重缺点一样多on our strength at least as much.无论是组织还是个人自身In an organization,as well as on the individual level,我们最注重的是克服缺点are we focusing most on overcoming deficiencies还是培养才能?or building the competencies—我们擅长什么 并是否取得了进步?what we are good at-- and getting better at it?个人或组织的自然倾向是什么What our natural inclination,individually or organizationally—我们是否更注重自己的自然倾向?do we focus on that and then build on that?注重健康的同时也要注重幸福Again,tie to success as well as wellbeing,如果我们是较为积极的话if we are more toward the positive side.我们如何活出自己的精彩?How do we live our lives?如何摆脱痛苦的经历Running away from painful experiences?或积极寻找快乐?Or actively seeking pleasure?如何摆脱悲伤?Running away from unhappiness?还是遵循宣言(独立宣言)行事Or adhering to the Declaration (Declaration of Independence)追求幸福?and pursuing happiness?举个例 下面的两种人看起来非常相似Now that may look quite similar-- for example,某人可能每周工作80小时someone may be working 80 hours a week,他习惯逃避 逃避家事running away from something-- running away from issues at home,逃避处理私事running away from dealing intra-personal issues但他看起来却和下面这种人一样and then may look exactly the same as the person她每周工作80小时 对工作who works 80 hours a week and who's extremely passionate充满热情about what she does.表面看来他们一样 但他们的内心感觉很不同May look the same but from the inside,they feel very different.一种是疾病模型One is the disease model:让我们逃避不如意的事let's run away from what is not working.另一种是健康模型The other is the health model:让我们追求激情 追求喜欢做的事let's pursue my passions,what I love to do.对疾病模型而言 最优水平是零The disease model,the optimum level is the zero:我们都平平安安 别受伤就好了let's just be Ok; let's just not hurt.再说一次 免受伤害是非常重要的And again,that's important to get rid of hurt.摆脱抑郁非常重要It's important to get rid of depression.但依健康模式来看 这是不够的But with the health model,they are saying that's not enough;让我们超越那种程度let's go beyond that.让我们兴奋起来 快乐起来Let's go to the excitement,to the fun.因为理想状态并不只是放松Because the ideal is not just a tensionless state.它是创造性的紧张状态It is the creative tension.我们会谈到它 会读到相关的文章We'll talk about it. We'll read about it.当我们"沉迷"之时 那就是我们感到兴奋When we do "flow". Flow is the state where we are excited,为所做之事着迷的状态where we are engaging what we are doing,那样大大超越了"舒适地麻木"where it's much more than being "comfortably numb".事实上 在那种状态下会有点不舒适In fact,it's a little bit uncomfortable.那是在我们舒适区之外的It's being outside of our comfort zone.可算是我们的延伸地带It's being in our stretch zone—不是会让人受伤的恐慌地带 而是延伸地带not the panic zone,where it hurts-- the stretch zone,其中有兴奋 还有点紧张where there is excitement,where there's some nervousness.还可能会有成长There is also growth there.所以 你的目的是什么?So what do you want?你想去哪?你要追求什么?Where do you want to go? What do you want to pursue?你想逃避愉悦吗?想逃避痛苦吗?Do you want to run away from pleasure-- run away from pain?你想逃避不快乐吗?Do you want to run away from unhappiness?还是你想追求幸福和快乐?Or do you want to pursue happiness and pleasure?你更注重你的不足之处Do you want to focus primarily on your deficiencies或缺点吗?or your weaknesses?还是更注重优点?Or your strength?什么是最有利的选择?什么是理想状态?What is the optimum? what is the ideal?有无形的障碍 零点吗?Is there a glass ceiling-- the zero?还是可以继续Or can it go on and on—寻找到更多的刺激 享受 激情?more excitement,more enjoyment,more passion?有一些关于健康模型的可怕说法Now there's something frightening about the health model.因为没有界线 如今它的使用程度Because there is no limit and there is less prescription there也远比疾病模型少certainly today than in the disease model.积极心理学Positive psychology,健康心理学的研究还处于初级阶段the field of health psychology is in infancy.而且有更多的研究是关于There's much more research,如何摆脱抑郁much more advice on how to get rid of depression如何发展自己的优点and how do I pursue my strength.但幸运的是 这就是为什么要学习积极心理学But fortunately,again,this is why positive psychology as大量的学者致力于a network of scholars applying themselves研究这些观点 它意义非凡to these ideas and ideals. It's so important因为今天你们会看到整个学期的概览because today you'll see throughout the semester有很多方法可以让我们的生活质量that there are so many more tools that we can apply to our lives,达到正值to go beyond the zero.这还不是全部That's not all.我说过有三个原因So I said there are three reasons.关键在于我们侧重点 侧重点创造现实It's about where we focus,focus creates reality;快乐并不只是对不快乐的否定it's about happiness is not just a negation of unhappiness;积极心理学之所以重要的第三个原因是the third reason why positive psychology is important积极心理学领域is because positive psychology and the areas还有与积极心理学that we study and more importantly,相关的领域apply within the field of positive psychology,不仅让我们从零点上升到正值do not just take us from the zero to the positive.积极心理学还帮助我们处理消极情绪They also help us deal with the negative.帮助我们处理焦虑不安They help us deal with anxiety,处理抑郁和痛苦的经历 及情感问题depression and painful experiences and emotions.当我们培养出积极性When we cultivate the positive,我们本质上是自我防御的we are essentially focusing on prevention.我解释一下Let me explain.过去10年多时间的研究发现What has been found over the last 10 years处理我们不断增加的抑郁病例and a little bit longer is the most effective way of actually个体的抑郁或焦虑dealing with a rising levels of depression in our culture,最有效方法是with individual depression or anxiety is actually not to不要直接专注于抑郁和焦虑focus on the depression and anxiety directly—这点也很重要that is important as well.事实证明 处理这种现象It is found that the most effective way最有效的方法是of dealing with this phenomenon was actually培养积极性和个人优点to cultivate the positive,to cultivate personal strengths,培育激情to cultivate and identify one's passions,提出这种问题"我人生中什么是有意义的?to ask a question such as "what is meaningful to me in my life?我的目的是什么?我为什么在这里?What's my purpose? Why am I here?毕业后我真正想做的是什么?"What do I really,really want to do once I graduate?"295提出这些问题People who ask these questions并认真思考这些问题的人and spend time on these questions,所追求的are much more likely to begin a quest不是避免痛苦that is not the avoid of painful emotions—而是no quest is—追求更多快乐but the quest is more enjoyable,more pleasurable,使生活更有意义 更成功more meaningful and also,more successful as it turns out.更重要的是 我将"更成功"But more importantly,more successful in称之为"终极货币"what I call the "the ultimate currency"—正如快乐货币和幸福货币一样just as the currency of happiness and wellbeing.究其原因 是因为有两种不同的方法The reason is because there are two different approaches对付疾病 一是积极心理学方法to deal with illness: one,the positive psychological approach is它指的是 疾病相当于不健康that the illness is the absence of health,相对地 健康等于没疾病as opposed to health is the absence of illness.我们想一下疾病模式I mean,think about the disease model.疾病模式是 "我们感到不适是因为生病了"The disease model is "we are sick because we are ill"—听到吗?我们病了是因为我们在生病do you listen to that? We are sick because we are ill.真的很深奥That was very profound.你们可能要好好想一下这句话You should think about it for a while here.可能要给点时间大家消化这话I'll let a time just to marinate it little bit so that you can.我重新说一遍Let me start that again.如果治好病 就会变得健康If we take away the illness,then we become healthy.这是个传统的模型That's the model,the conventional model.把病治好 就会变得健康 这很好Take away the illness. You'll become healthy. It's good.积极心理学模型略有不同The positive psychological model is slightly different.它说的是It is"你生病了 是因为你的生活还不够健康"you are ill because you don't have enough health in your life,因为你不去追求那些让你健康的东西"because you are not pursuing those things that make you healthy".什么使你健康?And what make you healthy?这我之前已谈过 追求有意义的生活 人生的目的The things I spoke about before: pursuing meaning,purpose;培养健康的人际关系cultivating healthy relationships.如果不具备这些 疾病就会趁虚而入If we don't have these things,that's when the illness comes in.两种模型Now the difference between the two models,健康模型和疾病模型的差异the health model and the disease model不仅仅是语义上的is more than just semantic.这是Abraham Maslow所说的神经官能症Here is Abraham Maslow talking about neurosis,"神经官能症描述的是人能变成怎样"Neurosis is a falling short of what one could have been或是他该变成怎样and even one could say,of what one should have been,从生理上来说就是是biologically speaking that is一个人是否能顺利地成长和发展if one had grown and developed in an unimpeded way.人类和个人的潜能已经消失Human and personal possibilities have been lost.世界逐渐缩小 意识也是The world has been narrowed and so has consciousness.能力也被抑制"Capacities have been inhibited."我来解释一下这话的意思Let me explain what he means here.他是说 我们正在生病 是因为我们没有What he means is that we are ill because we do not cultivate尽力做好我们本该做到的事what we are about enough.我们没做到自我实现We do not become self-actualized.没做到该做的We don't do what we are supposed to do.我们削弱自身力量 因此才会生病We diminish ourselves and that's when we become ill.才会不适That's when we are unwell.这和疾病模型所说的有很大不同This is very different from the disease model that says,"好 你不舒服 那就治病去吧""Ok,you are unwell. Deal with that illness."他说的是:"不 你不舒服What he's saying: "No. You are unwell.要注重健康 加强你的健康Focus on your health. Strengthen your health.因为你病了Because you are ill,因为你没有注重健康"because you are not focusing enough on your health."他将这称为He calls that,and I quote,"个人成长的失败""a failure of personal growth".如果我们感到焦虑That's when we experience neurosis.如果我们不注重培养自己的能力When we don't cultivate ourselves enough,不注重培养自己的人际关系 就会失败we don't cultivate our relationships enough,that's when we fail.积极心理学研究的是关于And what the positive psychology is all about is precisely that—培育自身成长和积极性cultivating personal growth,working on the positive.我们研究积极性 它处于这一边And we work on the positive on what comes of this side大家可以在这上面看到of the graph that you saw up there.在积极的一方 当我们注重培养这些情感因素On the positive side,when we cultivate these things,就会助于我们更好地处理it also helps us deal much better消极因素with the negative when dead arises.我想引用Martin Seligman的话I want to quote Martin Seligman,他说过这样一句话who talks about precisely this idea:"在过去的十年"In the last decade心理学家关心的都是预防的问题psychologists have become concerned with prevention.怎样才能预防像抑郁症这样的心理问题How can we prevent problems like depression或年轻人中常出现的药物滥用或精神分裂症or substance abuse or schizophrenia in young people谁天生敏感脆弱 谁又是who are genetically vulnerable or who live in worlds制造这些问题的人?that nurture these problems?如何防止校园暴力How can we prevent murderous schoolyard violence in children这些暴力事件通常是由掌握武器 缺乏父母监管who have access to weapons,poor parental supervision,或受到教唆的孩子引起的and a mean streak?"他问了这个问题 根据疾病模型Now he's asking this question and the disease model我们需要帮助他们直接response to this is we need to help them deal处理抑郁症directly with depression,还有他们的焦虑和忧愁with their anxiety and with their unhappiness才能防止所有这些社会弊病so that we can prevent all these social ills—无论是暴力还是不快乐whether it's violence,whether it's unhappiness.他是这么说的What he's saying here is the following:"五十多年的经验告诉我们 疾病模型"What we have learned over fifty years is that the disease model不能让我们更有力地预防does not move us closer to the prevention这些严重问题of these serious problems.事实上 在预防方面取得的重大进展Indeed the major strides in prevention基本上来自一个观点have largely come from a perspective focused也就是注重培养能力 而非改正错误"on systematically building competency,not correcting weakness."换句话说 健康模型倡导In other words,the health model:培养能力let's work on competencies.增强自身长处 改善人际关系Let's work on strength. Let's work on relationship.帮助人们找到对自己人生有意义的事Let's help them identify something meaningful in their life,和他们的热情所在their passion.那就是我们将要致力做到的And that's how we will,over time,同样对克服消极因素 有所帮助also help what comes off on the negative side.健康模型与疾病模型不同Health model versus the disease model疾病模型提倡直接处理疾病的that goes directly to deal with the disease.Seligman不是说"排除"疾病模型Now again,Seligman is not saying "to the exclusion of";而是说也可以用健康模型he's saying "also".他还说He continues,我们已发现有些人类的力量"We have discovered that there are human strengths能抵抗心理疾病that act as buffers against mental illness:勇气 未来规划 乐观 人际技巧courage,future-mindedness,optimism,interpersonal skill,信念 职业道德 希望 诚实 毅力faith,work ethic,hope,honesty,perseverance,专注及洞察力 诸如此类the capacity for flow and insight,to name several.研究证实 乐观可帮助儿童和成人We'v e shown that learning optimism prevents depression预防抑郁和焦虑and anxiety in children and adults,使未来两年的发病率降低一半roughly halving their incidence over the next 2 years.同样 如果我们要防止Similarly,I believe that if we wish to prevent drug abuse青少年受不良的社会环境影响in teenagers who grow up in a neighborhood而滥用药物的情况that puts them at risk,但预防的效果不佳the effective prevention is not remedial.相反 它认定并放大了这个事实Rather,it consists of identifying and amplifying就是青少年们已滥用药物"the strengths that these teens already have."Marva Collins所做的就是It's exactly what Marva Collins did:注重健康并用心栽培它focused on the health and cultivated it,浇水 给予阳光并时刻关注它watered it and shed a light to it,realized it.对这些观点的探讨将贯穿整个课程We'll talk about all these ideas throughout the course.健康模式能做的就是-What health model does—这是我们这堂课着重讲的内容this is the theme we go through all the course培养能力is cultivate capacity.培养我们处理It cultivates the capacity to deal消极因素的能力with the negatives when these arrive—无论是人际关系上的消极和痛苦经历whether it's negative and painful experiences in relationships,还是我们自身的or in ourselves.那意味着什么 我为大家做两个类比What does that mean? Let me draw two analogies.培养能力就是创造一个强大的Cultivating capacity is about creating a strong psychological心理免疫系统immune system.这是Nathaniel Branden的观点These are the words of Nathaniel Branden.心理学免疫系统Psychological immune system.如果我们有强大的生理免疫系统会怎样?What happens when we have a strong physical immune system?这是否意味着我们不会生病?Does it mean we don't get ill?当然不是 还是会生病Of course not. We do.但这意味着我们不会常生病 就算病了But it means that we get ill less often and when we do get sick,也能恢复得更快we recover more promptly.这就是培养的力量This is exactly what cultivating strength,乐观 追求 意义 规划optimism,sense of purpose,meaning,mindfulness—正是这些因素的作用this is exactly what these characteristics do.他们会放大并改变They enlarge transform—我们看待和体验世界的方式the way we see,the way we experience the world,让我们突破框架 引发潜能enlarge the capacity of the form and使我们能更好地应对不可避免的困难that's we are better able to deal the inevitable difficulties.不可避免的困难的确存在And there are inevitable difficulties.没有谁的人生是一帆风顺的No life is completely immune to those.它可以增强我们的免疫系统So it strengthens our immune system.另一个类比是关于引擎的And another analogy we can use is of an engine.如果我们用的引擎很小If we have a small engine,想把车开上一个陡峭崎岖的山坡and we have to pull the car up a steep hill,a difficult hill,引擎很容易损毁 爆炸the engine is more likely to collapse,to blow up.但如果我们的引擎够大Whereas If our engine is large,要上那山就容易得多we are much more likely to get up that hill,不费吹灰之力就能做到and to do it gracefully with relative ease.所以我们在做的是 培养积极性So what we are doing: we cultivate the positive;按那个比喻来说 我们正在增强we are strengthening our,metaphorically speaking,心理"引擎"psychological "engine";我们能够更好将负值转化为零and we are better able to deal with the negative to zero,更别说还能变得更快乐not to mention the fact that we are also able to become happier.因为快乐不会自发而来Because happiness does not just come spontaneously不会因为消除了忧愁 就变得快乐when we negate unhappiness.我想说说我们这里的事I want to go back to our local village.记得上次So remember last time我提出的《哈佛克里姆森》杂志里的文章I put up the article by the Crimson (Harvard Crimson magazine)很可惜我找不到that was unfortunately I couldn't find更近期一点的 那是2004年的?a more recent one-- that was 2004?但今天的情况非常相似But the situation is rather similar today.那篇文章提到的一点是And one of the things that the Crimson article said is that我们需要为哈佛学生的心理健康投入更多we need to put more resources into mental health at Harvard.这点很重要的 我非常赞同And that's important,I agree.这只是其中一点However,it's only part of the picture.投入到其他一些地方in some different places as well-- not only,as well.因为只是投入资源Because it's just not enough to put these resources in places帮助我们应对抑郁 焦虑和忧愁that help us deal with our depression and anxiety是远远不够的and unhappiness directly.同样重要的是 投入资源It is also important to put these resources in places帮助我们培养自身能力that help us cultivate capacity,应对困难和艰辛的能力the capacity to deal with these difficulties and hardships这些困难一直存在并会继续出现的when they arise and they will arise.换句话说 必须在以下方面投入更多资源In other words,there has to be more resources put in places例如帮助学生发掘such as helping students identify their passions自己的兴趣when they come here,帮助学生发现人生的意义helping students identify their sense of meaning in life,使他们明确自己helping students identify what they真正想做的事really,really,really want to do,帮助他们克服那种诱惑helping students overcome the pull,身边常出现的诱惑the external pull that is often there,会让他们偏离自己的道路taking them away from their core,还有凿掉那些束缚helping them chip away those limitations,摆脱杂念 帮助他们找到自己的真实个性those voices,helping students identify who they really are,还有帮助学生了解自己的强项helping students identify their strengths并在哈佛实现一切and pursuing those while here at Harvard.所有这些能力All these capabilities,所有这些技能 大多数都all these skills or skills that are mostly—我不只是说哈佛and I'm not just talking about Harvard—而是全球范围内 没有一所学校会教这些技能globally-- not taught in schools.所以我们需要教他们And we need to teach them.这并不是说哈佛现在This is not to say that what is going at Harvard正投入大量资源的方面不重要with numerous resources that we do have here is not important.这些方面都非常重要的It is very important.举个小例子Just take a small example:学习咨询处the Bureau of Study Counsel.我不知道你们有多少人利用过该资源I don't know how many of you have used that resource.我念本科时已开始接触它I've used it as an undergrad.至今还在与他们一起做某些工作I still use it now,doing some work with them.去年我与他们合作过I did some work with them last year.他们真的很棒And they are wonderful.同时 我们还需要培养积极性And at the same time,we also need to cultivate the positive,探究如何让我们从零点升到正直to think more of the zero to the positive side该如何做of the equation as well.这就是积极心理学的作用And this is what positive psychology does我希望1504号课程在一定程度上会有帮助and I hope this is what 1504 to some extent will help do.总之To summarize,"积极心理学运动提醒我们"the message of the positive psychology movement这个领域已与过去不同is to remind our field that it has been deformed.心理学不仅是对疾病 弱点和伤害进行研究Psychology is not just the study of disease,weakness,and damage它也研究优点和美德it also is the study of strength and virtue,治疗不只是修复错误Treatment is not just fixing what is wrong;同时也要塑造正确的东西it also is building what is right.心理学关注的不仅仅是疾病或健康状况Psychology is not just about illness or health;还包括工作 教育 洞察力 爱 成长和玩乐it is about work,education,insight,love,growth,and play.在追求理想状态时And in this quest for what is best,积极心理学不会盲目主观positive psychology does not rely on wishful thinking,或自欺欺人 或敷衍了事self-deception,or hand waving;相反 它尝试用最科学的方法来探究instead,it tries to adapt what is best in the scientific method极其复杂的人类行为所表现出来的to the unique problems that human behavior presents特殊问题"in all its complexity."还涉及到如何将学校与社会连接起来It's about bridging the Ivory tower and the Main Street这个我认为最重要的领域in the area that I believe is the most important one对我们来说都有意义and talks to each and every one of us.好 我继续说下去I want to move on now.我想先说说下一节关于选择的课程I want to move on to the next selective lectures—两节或两节半课two or two and a half lectures,我将会谈到where I am going to be talking about本课程的基本前提the basic premises of this course.正如我刚才所说As I said earlier,本课程并不是积极心理学的调研课this course is not a survey course of positive psychology.这是关于选择"问题中的问题"的It's very selective. It's about the question of questions.有什么可以帮助我们个人What can help us individuals,帮助我们的社会更快乐 不是快乐 是更快乐what can help our community become happier-- not happy,happier.三个月后 期末时So by the end of these three months semester,你会变得更快乐you are happier than you were before.到学期末 你很可能比现在的你You are from now,you'll be hopefully happier than you were更快乐at the end of the semester.越来越快乐And so on and so on.基本前提是什么?So what are the basic premises?备课时我想和大家说些什么呢?Where am I coming here when I think about this course?我想为大家介绍Well what I want to do is to share with you五个基本前提the five basic premises.介绍这些前提 要从And these premises are going to be presented as something and—它的对立面说起essentially it's opposite.下面这些问题非常明确So that were clear from the outset:我们从哪里来 我从哪里来where we are coming from,where I am coming from,教学人员从哪里来where the teaching staff is coming from—了解这些后我们就能建立本课程的基础and also so that we can build the foundation of the course.记得一开始我就跟你们说过Remember I talk those of you who were here the first time:这课程就像个螺旋this course is built like a spiral内部的一切都是相关的Everything is intra-connected,第一节课讲到的内容what I talked about in the first class is connected to与今天要谈的课题有关what I'm going to talk about today,也和第19课有关is going to be connected to lecture 19.从许多方面来看 这个前提So in many ways the premises,跟我们开头的两节课有关coupled with what we discussed in the first two lectures,会建立这个螺旋的基础build the foundation of that spiral,那其他一切就更容易建起来upon which everything else will be built.这里有五个基本前提So here are the five basic premises.我会先简短地介绍一下 再逐个阐述I'll go through them briefly now and elaborate on each在接下来的几节课里 会分别对它们in the next couple of lectures,interweaving them进行学习 研究 和应用with studies,research as well as applications.正如我开始时提到的 这课程是关于搭建桥梁的First,this course as I mentioned first is about bridge building:搭建学科之间的桥梁 广集思源bridge building among disciplines,eclectic,并搭建学术界与社会之间的桥梁and bridge building in terms of academia and Main street.00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:06,410专业化常在学术界占主导地位the specialization is very often dominant in academia.本课程的做法The approach of this course,正好相反with all its challenges,is the opposite.如果我认为没有改变的可能Once again I wouldn't be teaching this class,就不会教这节课if I didn't change is possible.心理学的研究有很多There is a lot of research in psychology,很多证据显示 改变是非常困难的事a lot of evidence that shows how difficult change is.我认为改变是可能的So I will argue that change is possible,无论是个人变化whether it's individual change,还是组织变革organizational change.我们将探讨为什么是可能的And we'll start to look at how it's possible.这只是整个螺旋的最基本层次Just the very basic level of the spiral.我们本周只讨论"改变"We have an entire week just devoted to change.我们会详细讨论We will elaborate on that:技巧 方法 工具techniques,methods,tools.第三 这个前提与Third,premise related to the first决定幸福的内部因素有关internal factors primarily determine happiness—这是我要讨论的this is what I'm going to argue for—与决定幸福的is opposed to happiness which is primarily function外部环境无关of external circumstances.并不是说 外部环境不重要Not saying that the external circumstances are not important,我们同样应该注重改善外部环境we should focus also on improving them,bettering them,无论是我们自己 或对整个社会whether for ourselves,for society at large.然而 幸福主要However,happiness primarily—在于我们如何看待世界not only,primarily—is dependent on how we perceive the world,社会习俗规条 我们理性和感性上的认知on the form,on our interpretation,on our perception."只能顺从人性"Human nature must be obeyed在各个方面This,in many ways,这酿成了历史上许多冲突captures conflict that has gone throughout human history,无论是政治上 还是宗教上whether you look at politics,whether you look at religion,无论是哲学 还是心理学whether you look at philosophy as well as today,psychology.我们如何看待人性?How do we look at human nature?是人性有缺陷 因此需要进一步完善吗?Is human nature flawed and therefore needs to be perfected?还是尽管我们不喜欢人性中的缺陷Or is human nature flawed maybe something we don't like也必须接受它?but we need to accept it and work with it?我会谈到后者I'm going to argue for the latter of what I just said,就是说我们必须顺从于人性for the fact that human nature needs to be obeyed接受它所有的缺陷和优点with all its flaws,with all its shortcomings,而不是试图从心理层面上as opposed to attempting to perfect it完善它on the psychological level.我们下节课再说这话题We'll get to that next time.颇具争议的是Controversial,精神健康和幸福的重要基础the very important foundation of mental health and wellbeing.最后And finally,我想说的是 幸福不应该只是what I am going to argue for is that happiness isn't ought to be我们追求的最终目标 还是一种道德追求the ultimate end which we pursue and that is also a moral claim,而不是一种普通的追求as opposed to happiness just being another secondary pursuit但也有些追求and there are pursuits—是更高级 更重要 更高尚的there are higher,more important,more moral than that.这一点也颇具争议Once again,may sound controversial.我也会涉及疾病I'll try reconcile the disease,和大家也许关心过的忧愁the unhappiness that you may experience thinking about that.同样 这留待下节课再讲Again,more on that next time.现在我们先从搭建"桥梁"说起So let me begin with bridge building.说回第一节课开始时Here I am going back to what I talked about right624谈到的问题at the very beginning of the first lecture.也就是 搭起学校与社会之间的桥梁的想法The idea of bridging Ivory tower and Main Street.学术界内外 都有很多人There are many people in academia,outside academia,将世界一分为二who divide the world essentially into two.他们将外面的世界看成是现实They talked about the real world that is outside,是肮脏的 不洁 被亵渎的 而学术界that is dirty,impure,profane versus academia,则是崇高的 有理想的 神圣的which is lofty,idealistic,sacred.神圣与亵渎Sacred versus the profane.这种区分带来伤害This distinction hurts.它同时伤害了学术界及非学术界的人It hurts academia and hurts people who are outside of academia.哲学家Alfred North WhiteheadAlfred North Whitehead,the philosopher:"大学小心翼翼地将我们"The careful shielding of a university与外界活动隔开from the activities of the world around us这样最容易打击学习兴趣 阻碍学习进步is the best way to chill interest and to defeat progress.大学不适合独身生活Celibacy does not suit a university.必须要与身边的人互动It must mate itself with action."640这点对大学生活非常重要This is very important for university.他当时提到另一种心理学talked about a second psychology.他说另一种心理学就是He said second psychology is a psychology抛开实验室的研究that leaves the labs that draws on the research done in the labs实验室研究意义重大that is important and meaningful,但不只是注重这种研究however,doesn't only focus on that.而是走到外面的世界It goes out to the outside world,与外界互动 接触那些"肮脏"事物interacts,gets its hand and mind dirty,在外面工作 并吸取经验does work outside and then applies its work从"肮脏经验"中学习and learns from "the dirty experiences"将得到的经验带回实验室and brings it back to the lab诸如此类 就像一个上升的螺旋and so on and so on in an upward spiral.他称之为重要的另一种心理学He called it the important second psychology,这也是Alfred North Whitehead所提倡的which is what Alfred North Whitehead is also talking about.现在你们来到这里Now you may be sitting here且大多数人将来都不会进入学术界and most of you aren't going to academia.你可能会想And you are thinking to yourself,"好 学术界要结合实践做研究"Ok,fine. So university,academia must make itself with action.那与我有何关系?我们的联系在哪?"What does it have to do with me? How is this relevant to me?"它不仅与你有联系 它与你息息相关Not only is it relevant to you,it has everything to do with you.下面就是原因And here's why.世界最需要的What the world needs,不是其他什么 就是务实的理想主义者more than anything else,is practical idealists.我做过6年莱弗里特宿舍的住校导师For 6 years,I was a resident tutor in Leverett House我研究生在读时 就开始任教when I was a graduate student and then I also started to teach.在与学生的交谈中 让我印象最深的是And what struck me most about conversations that I had,无论是在莱弗里特宿舍或其他地方either in Leverett or other houses,学生们的使命感 你们的使命感were students is their sense of mission,your sense of mission,你们对成功的渴望your desire to do good,让世界变得更美好的愿望to make the world a better place.据我了解 很多学生毕业后And as I followed many of the students after they graduate,无论是与我一起工作whether the students who work with me here as undergrads还是我辅导的学生or students who I tutored,当我了解他们的前路 并不是些空话when I followed the path,it wasn't just empty words.这些学生勇往直前 做了非常棒的事These students went ahead and did wonderful things,无论是校外校内的whether it was right out of college,无论他们是否刚建立起自身whether it was once they established themselves,但可以确定的是 他们潜藏的思想but there was always this,the back of their mind,很多时候会涌现出来very often fore of their minds,"我怎样才能使这个世界变得更美好?""How can I make this world a better place?"充满热情 理想化Passionate. Idealistic.美好 极其美好Good-- in the deep sense,good.渴望改变世界This desire to make a difference是所有学生都有的想法come into just about all students.很多人认为这一代人There are many people who talk about this generation以自我为中心as the "ME" generation: all I care about,这一代人只关心all this generation cares about is"赚更多的钱""well,let me just make more money","买大一点的房子""let me just get a bigger house","更成功 取得更高荣誉"let me just be more successful and accrue more eclats,变得更有威望"more prestige".这是一种错误的刻板印象This is a false stereotype.是的 荣誉 威望 金钱是重要的Yes,eclats,prestige,money is important.这对大多数人来说都很重要It's important to most people in the world.甚至是最重要的A big deal.但有这些刻板印象的人But were these people who have these stereotypes—他们只看到这些是最重要的吗?were they (?) is that they see just that?他们并不渴望改变世界And they don't see the desire to make a difference.每年哈佛有1800 students at Harvard each year,约1800名学生是about 1800 students are members ofPBHA(菲利普斯布鲁克斯楼协会)的成员PBHA (Phillips Brooks House Association).不仅如此That's not all.还有一些没加入PBHA的学生甘当志愿者There are other students who outside PBHA and who volunteer.几乎所有人都是Just about every single one of you.看一下统计数据At least if we look at the statistics,你们每个人just about every single one of you,很快very soon,离开哈佛后 都将加入公司after you leave Harvard,will join an organization,无论它是否你的主要工作whether--it could be your primary job or not—这个组织是个社会企业an organization that is a social enterprise,非盈利机构 只为贡献社会而存在的not for profit,something to better the world.你会加入这样一个组织You'll be on boards of such organizations.你会捐钱给这些组织You'll donate money to such organizations.哈佛毕业生一向慷慨 无论是对时间Harvard grads are generous with their time,还是金钱和努力with their money,with their efforts,无论是商学院 法学院whether the business school,the law school,医学院 教育学院college,Med school,Ed school—你对社会贡献甚多 是因为你在乎you give a lot,because you care.无论是要贡献金钱还是时间 通常两者都要Again whether it's money,whether it's time-- usually both.都是成见False stereotypes.关于美国人也有些成见There are also false stereotypes about Americans.凭经验来说 美国人Americans,empirically speaking—或只是说哈佛学生just empirically speaking about the Harvard students,根据发展趋势和统计looking the trends and statistics-- empirically speaking,美国人是世界上最慷慨的人Americans are the most generous people in the world.不仅仅是因为他们更富有Not just because they have more money to give,的确 美国人更富有yes,Americans have more money to give他们常捐钱and they give a lot more money,无论是在扶贫或医疗救助方面whether it's in food,whether it's in medical aid.有研究证实 美国人也花最多时间Americans also spend the most time-- this is a research done (?)—比其他任何人所花的时间都多Americans spend the most time out of any other people平均每周有四个小时做志愿者的工作in the world volunteering in average four hours a week,做与自身工作无关的善事volunteering outside their job which may also have他们比世界上其他人更具社会目标a social objective more than any other people in the world.对于这个美好国家的成见Once again,false stereotypes about this wonderful country.这里很美好And this is wonderful.能来到这里是件美好的事This is wonderful to see,wonderful to be here,无论是在哈佛 还是在美国 真的很荣幸whether it's Harvard,whether it's America-- a real privilege.你们许多人You see,many of you,不久将会身居要职not far from now,you will be in influential positions.你们能够做善事吗Will you be able to do a lot of good在一个非营利机构里行善in a for-profit organization,not for profit organization,在你母校的董事会on the board of your previous school,贡献金钱和时间with your money,with your time?然而However—这是个原因and here is the however—我与许多研究生相处过I've met many grad students with me或当导师时的学生or students when I was a tutor学生曾跟我谈及他们的困扰who express their frustration to me.他们曾对我说 "你知道They said to me,"You know,我曾有世界上最良好的意愿I had all the good intentions in the world.我有最善良的心 想为世界作贡献I have all the good intentions in the world. I want to do good.我奉献出时间和金钱I've donated my time,my money.但还是觉得若有所失But I feel that something is missing.我觉得我能改变世界的能力I feel that I've fallen short of my potential越来越弱了"to really make a difference."为什么呢?因为美好的意愿和理想主义Why? Because good will and idealism,虽然必要 但却是不够的while necessary,they are not sufficient.远远不够Not enough.因为很多时候 即使有很好的意愿Because very often,with very good intentions,我们的能力还是有限we may fall short of what we are capable of doing,或在某些情况下 我们带来的伤害多于帮助or in some situations,even hurt more than help.有一些研究表明And we'll look at some of these studies,即使到了今天仍有hopefully still today,想做好事的人却好心干坏事with very good intentions actually hurt more they helped.数十年来的心理学家都有很好的意愿Psychologists for decades had very good intentions想帮助高危人群about helping at risk population.大量的金钱-数百万美元投资在研究上A lot of money-- millions,millions of dollars went into that.但收效甚微With very little effect.为什么呢?因为他们没有提出这样的问题Why? Because they didn't ask the question这特定情况下 他们应该问这个问题that they needed to ask,which was,in that particular case,这个健康本源的问题 为什么有些人the salutogenic question: why do some individuals succeed成长环境恶劣 依然能成功?despite unfavorable circumstances?即使不提出这个问题 他们也是心怀善意的There were very good intentions before this question was asked.充满理想主义There was a lot of idealism.这是不够的It wasn't enough.很多时候 这些干预会产生Very often,some of these interventions engendered消极的受害者心态the passive victim mentality,而不是积极作用者心态as opposed to the active agent mentality这是Marva Collins提出的观点that Marva Collins instilled,是根据Karen Reivich和Martin Seligman的研究所提的the programs by Karen Reivich and Martin Seligman instill.这正是心理学起作用的地方And this is where psychology can help.因为我们可以展开研究Because we can take the research and apply it.并应用到现实中We can take the research and apply it,又回到了那个问题 为什么which goes back to the point why it is so important搭起学校与社会的桥梁如此重要to bridge Ivory tower and Main Street.大多数这类研究并没运用于现实Most of these research is not applied.例如So for example:有多少教师在课室努力工作how many teachers working in the classroom日复一日地研究皮格马利翁效应?day in and day out know about the Pygmalion effect?我们下周或再下周会探讨The Pygmalion effect that we are going to talk about皮格马利翁效应next week or the week after,说明为什么教师的期望就是自我实现的预言shows how teachers' expectations are self-fulfilling prophecies.如果我们有很高的期望And if we have high expectations,如果我们在学生身上看到伟大的潜能if we see the seed of greatness in the students,那么这种潜能就更可能被激发that seed of greatness is more likely to flourish.或者 如果我们看不到这潜能Or if we don't appreciate it,它就会像刚萌芽的幼苗一样被扼杀it will depreciate—wither and die.有多少教师了解这些研究?How many teachers know about these studies?他们怎样通过自己的信念And how they create through their beliefs创造出自我实现的预言 来影响学生?the self-fulfilling prophecy when it comes to their students?有多少教师了解Marva Collins?How many teachers know about Marva Collins?每个教师在第一次接受教师培训时Every teacher in the world on the first day of teacher training需要了解Marva Collins和皮格马利翁效应need to learn about Marva Collins and Pygmalion effect.但事实并非如此They don't do that.接下来谈How about this?自我尊重Self-esteem.你如何提升自尊?How do you increase self-esteem?如果我在这里做一项民意调查 保证大多数人If I have to do a poll here,most people,会说通过赞美来提升guaranteed,would say praise people.赞美别人 赞美孩子Praise people. Praise children.这将增强他们的自尊It will enhance their self-esteem.说对了一部分Right. Partially right.如果把这当作全部的真理And if it's taken as the whole truth,则是有害的and nothing but the truth,it's detrimental.因为有很多研究显示Because there is a lot of research that shows当我们不加区别地赞扬别人when we praise people indiscriminately,我们实际上是在长期地we are actually in the long run默默地伤害他们 而非帮助他们potentially hurting them more than helping them,无论是对他们的幸福感 还是成功whether it's their wellbeing,as well as their success.但关于提升自尊有个常见的说法But the self-esteem movement mostly says要经常赞美别人和孩子praise people,praise children all the time.这点很重要And again,that's important.同样重要的是 要懂得如何赞美But it's also important to know how to praise.有多少人了解How many people are familiar with the work斯坦福大学心理学家Carol Dweck的作品of the Stanford psychologist,Carol Dweck.你们在这几周内会了解到Well,you are going to be familiar with it in a few weeks.很多好心的理想主义者都不了解这些Many idealists with good intentions are not.他们依然认为And they continue to support or to practice提升自尊就要不加区别地赞扬self-esteem as indiscriminate praise,这最终造成的伤害大于帮助ultimately hurting more than helping.有多少心理学家或干涉主义者How many psychologists,or rather how many interventionists怀有好的意愿 同时又了解with good intentions are familiarAlbert Bandura关于自我效能感论的研究?with the work of Albert Bandura on self-efficacy?要怎样培养?And how you cultivate that?还不够Not enough.很多时候结果都是弊大于利And very often,more harm than good is created.有多少心理学家了解How many psychologists are familiar这个心理和生理的新领域?with this new emerging field of the mind and the body?有多少人知道下面这个让人欣慰的案例How many know about the studies that cheerful瑜伽练习example that yoga practice diminishes significantly,比任何试过的干预措施都有效more than any other interventions that they tried,犯人在监狱里练瑜伽the likelihood of second-time offenders会降低他们的二次犯罪率when they practice it in jail?在狱中练过瑜伽的犯人After their release,they are much less likely to return to jail获释后较少会再进监狱if they do some yoga there.虽奇怪 但却是事实Strange,but true.有多少人知道-How many people know that—这点与我提出的第一个观点有关-and this is connected to my first point—多少人知道 冥想能转换我们的大脑思维that doing meditation actually literally transforms our brain,使我们更容易感染到积极情绪making us more susceptible to positive emotions在面对痛苦时更坚强and more resilient in the face of painful emotions.多少人知道 每周三次How many people know that three times a week体育锻炼 每次三十分钟 与最强劲的精神药物physical exercise,30 minutes each time has the same effect有同样的效果?as our most powerful psychiatric drugs?每周三次 每次30分钟Three times a week for 30 minutes.多少心理学家或精神科医生规定病人How many psychologists or psychiatrists prescribe"每周跑步锻炼三次 早上来见我"?"run three times a week and see me in the morning"?还不够Not enough.这是实际与理想主义相结合That's practical idealism coupled together.在解决冲突时How are in conflict resolution,大多数人the dominant theme of most people好心想要解决冲突with good intentions want to resolve conflict让人们坐下来is let's get the people together,好好谈谈let's get them to talk,然后就能过上幸福快乐的日子and they and we will live happily ever after.我们有1954年的研究Well we have research from 1954—那些想从社会心理方面解决冲突的人 Muzafer Sherifthose of you who take social psych—Muzafer sherif,显示接触假说showing that the contact hypothesis也就是让人们彼此交谈的方法which is just get people to talk to one another,并不起作用doesn't work;很多时候反而让情况更糟in fact very often it worsens the situation—很多时候会使冲突进一步恶化very often the conflict actually gets worse因为人们只是聚在一起进行商谈as a result of just getting together and talking,接触还不够that the contact is not enough,你需要的是that what you need,引用Muzafer警长的话in the words of Muzafer sherif后来由Elliot Aronson详细阐述-and later elaborated on by Elliot Aronson—你需要的是一个非常明确的目标what you need is a superordinate goal—一个得集体实现的目标a goal that you have carry out together,你自己一人做不来的that you cannot do by yourself—由一个内部有冲突的小组来实现carry out together with a conflicting group.这样随着时间的推移 就能解决冲突And that's how over time you resolve conflicts,不仅是让人们聚在一起而已not just bring people together.可以想到 这离我们的意愿不远了Now as you can imagine,this is very close to home for me.因为在阿拉伯 以色列冲突中Because there were many people on both sides双方都有很多人想结束战争of the Arab/Israeli conflict who wanted to end it,美国也有很多人想结束它many people in this country who wanted to end it.他们做了什么呢?So what did they do?我们把他们关到一个房间里吧Let's just get them together. Let's get them in a room,无论是在戴维营 奥斯陆或埃及whether it was in Camp David,whether it was in Oslo or in Egypt.让他们交谈 解决他们的冲突Let's just get them together to talk,to resolve their conflict和他们的问题 然后我们就能过上幸福生活and their issue and then we will all live happily ever after.那样会发生什么事呢?What happened?局势会恶化The situation worsened.现在我们都知道这个道理了Now we've known that.Muzafer警长在1954年就证明了Muzafer sherif showed that in 接触假设 只让人们一起交谈that it is the most likelihood outcome最可能的结果是引起更多冲突of just contact hypothesis,just getting them to be together.有很多人都试图解决冲突And there were many people trying to resolve the conflict,不只在中东 世界各地都有这种情况not just in the Middle East,else in the world,人们都心存好意with very good intentions但往往在不经意间使事情变得更糟but very often making inadvertently the matters worse.理想主义和善意是不够的Idealism and good intentions are not enough.我们需要将理论结合实践We need to merge,to mate the research with the practice.需要你们这样做And this is where you come in,认真对待taking it seriously.但当我认真对待这事Now when I take it seriously,就出现了一个问题there is a problem here有时研究所得并不一定是好消息because sometimes research doesn't deliver good news.如果仅仅是将It would be much easier and nicer以色列人和阿拉伯人聚在一起 冲突就结束if we could just simply get那事情就简单得多 容易得多Israelis and Arabs together and the conflict would end.这将让事情变得更简单It would be much nicer and easier,smoother,非常容易it would be much easier,如果我们要培养孩子自尊if we could just cultivate children self-esteem仅仅通过多一些赞美by giving them positive feedback—告诉他们 他们有多棒telling them how wonderful they are.这很容易做到 不是吗?It's easy to do,right?这样感觉很好 他们感觉良好 我们也是It feels good. They feel good. We feel good.但从长远来看 仅仅这样做并没有帮助But in the long run,it doesn't help,if it's only that.只是容易而已Much easier.研究往往带来坏消息And research very often delivers bad news,只是接触还不够saying it's not enough-- the contact;只是赞扬还不够it's not enough to praise.然后人们下意识地选择And then people choose subconsciously,不自觉地忽视研究所得的坏结果not consciously to ignore the research and go with her heart.虽然跟随自己的感觉是重要And that's important to go with your heart.但更重要的是同时注重感觉和思维But it's important to with the heart and the mind.试想一下 如果一个航空工程师Imagine if an aeronautics engineer在早上醒来 说:woke up in the morning and said,"万有引力"you know,the Law of Gravity thing真的带给我很多麻烦really makes things difficult for me.很麻烦It's a pain.如果没有万有引力 事情就易办多了Things would be so much easier without the law of gravity.航空设备也不用这么麻烦"The design would be simpler."然后他决定不考虑万有引力设计飞机And he designs airplane and he ignores the law of gravity.他会设计出怎样一架飞机呢?What kind of airplane machine would he or she design?肯定会失败A failure.航空工程师必定要考虑到现实Aeronautics engineer takes into consideration of reality.现实就是万有引力的存在And reality-- there's Law of Gravity.我们得接受现实We deal with that.同样 研究显示的结果就是现实Similarly,what research shows us is reality:有哪些现象 哪些可行 哪些不可行what's out there,what's working and what's not working.我们需要遵循现实And we need to conform to it.考虑现实Take it into consideration.能否搭起学校与社会的桥梁And it's up to you,to take responsibility,取决于我们自己to bridge the Ivory tower and Main Street.在哈佛你们会有32种专业You are being exposed in 32 classes fraught your Harvard career各自的课程有不同的主题to the most rigorous thinking on different topics你要将这些知识一一吸收并应用have you take it and apply it,无论是心理学还是经济学whether it's psychology,whether it's in economics,当然如果是工程学或计算机科学obviously in engineering or computer science,就会比社会科学和人文科学where it's done much more readily更容易理解than in social sciences and humanities.重点是 你要为自己负责It's important to take responsibilities,因为没人会来帮你because no one else is going to do it for you.没人会帮你No one is coming.第二前提Premise 2:作为一个实际的理想主义者To be a practical idealist,它的基础必须是the foundation of it has to be相信改变是可能的the belief that change is possible.因为如果从个人层面或社会层面来说Because if the change was not possible on the individual level,改变都是不可能的 那我在这里干什么?on the society level,why am I doing what I am doing?为什么我要花时间在这里?Why would I spend time?倒不如做个享乐主义者Let me just be a hedonist,尽情享受生活trying to enjoy my life as much as possible.你们可能会说Now for many of you,when you look at this you may say,"好吧 改变是有可能的"Well,Ok,yes,change is possible.我相信这一点 但为什么我们需要把它I believe that and why do we need to have it作为课程的基本前提as a basic premise of the course,而不说'改变是虚幻的'?"as opposed to change is illusive?"在心理学上Well,in the context of a psychology course,改变是有可能的 这点十分重要it's anything but trivial that change is possible.下面我用一项研究来说明Let me share with you one study to illustrate what I mean.明尼苏达州的双胞胎研究The Minnesota Twin study,一个在心理学领域非常有名的研究one of the most famous studies in the field of psychology,是两个杰出的心理学家Lykken和Tellegen做的was done by Lykken and Tellegen,two prominent psychologists.这个研究是关于And what they did was they wanted to understand基因的重要性how much do genes matter.与教育相比 它对性格的影响多大?How much is it about nature versus nurture?要如何测试呢?So how do you test that?同卵双胞胎You look at identical twins,他们拥有相同的基因谱monozygotic twins who share the same genetic profile.研究那些被分开抚养长大的同卵双胞胎And you look at those who are reared apart.因为如果他们由相同的父母抚养 人们会说Because if they are reared by the same parents,one could argue,"他们这么相似 是因为有同样的成长环境"Well they came out very similar because same environment:他们外表一模一样 上一样的学校they look the same; they go to the same schools;有同样的父母 等等"same parents,and so on."如果你能找到 出生时就分开了的But what if you are able to find identical twins同卵双胞胎who were separated at birth,在完全不同的环境里长大and reared in radically different environments.现实中能找到这种人Well you could.学者发现有很多这样的人And they found significant number of those,有时甚至在不同的洲长大reared in,sometimes different continents.他们对这些双胞胎进行了研究And they studied them.发现了一个明显的现象And what they found remarkably这些双胞胎极其相似was significant similarities among these twins,有时相似之处非常惊人sometimes to the points of unbelievable.像有一组双胞胎Like one set of twins—他们娶了名字相同的妻子I think they found the wives with the same name.他们在不同的国家长大They were reared in different countries,直到37岁才知道对方的存在didn't know about each other until the age of 37—娶了相似的妻子 喝同一种啤酒married similar wives,enjoyed drinking the same beer,为自己的孩子取相同的名字called their children by the same names.有些相似之处令人难以置信There were some mind-boggling similarities.有例外And this is an exception,但也只有很少例外but there were quite a few of those exceptions.让心理学家更感兴趣的是But more interesting for psychologists他们的个性非常相似was that their personality was incredibly similar.让积极心理学学者 和研究幸福和快乐的人And very interesting for positive psychologists,更感兴趣的是those concerned with wellbeing and happiness:这些双胞胎的幸福和快乐水平非常相似their wellbeing and happiness levels were incredibly similar.即使他们在完全不同的环境中长大Even if they were raised in radically different environments.Lykken和Tellegen发表了一篇文章Lykken and Tellegen published a paper,一篇在80年代非常有影响力的论文a very influential paper in the 80s,论文题为"幸福是一种随机现象"which they called "Happiness is a Stochastic Phenomenon".论文用以下这句话作结尾And they end this paper with the following quote:"想变得更快乐"It may be that trying to be happier和想变高一样徒劳is as futile as trying to be taller只会适得其反"and is therefore counterproductive."这句话有两方面让我觉得不快This quote made me very unhappy on two accounts.这是句非常有影响力的名言This wa s a very influential quote.曾被登上《纽约时报》This appeared in New York Times.他们也在电视上说过这话They talked about on television.受访时也说过They were interviewed.这就有问题了Very problematic.那我们在这里做什么?Coz what are we doing here?如果这是那次研究的结果If this is the outcome of the research,一项严谨的研究a rigorous research that they did—而不是马马虎虎的轻松的研究not an easy research to go and look around the world,我们能做些什么呢?what can we do about it?我认为Here is my response to that:简单来说 改变是可能的Very simply,change is possible.别盲目相信我的话And again,don't take my word for it of course.下面我来详细阐述这话Let me discuss that further-- elaborate.有证据显示There is account of evidence人们的确是会改变的where people actually do change我们有研究显示 经常接受治疗的人and we have research showing that people going to therapy会容易改变very often change as the a result of therapy.斯坦福大学的心理学家Albert Bandura的研究Work by Albert Bandura,Stanford psychologist表明 人们常因遇到一个特别的句子shows that very often people encountering one special sentence,读到或听到它reading it or hearing it from something,这句话就会改变他们的生活that sentence can change their lives,在书上读到 或是有某种经历-reading it on certain book,having certain experiences—积极的或痛苦的经历-positive or painful experiences –有这样一个概念叫做 创伤后应激障碍(PTSD)there is this concept of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).还有一种概念叫做 创伤后成长There is also a concept of Post-Traumatic Growth.人们的快乐水平会上下变化So people change-- up or down in their level of happiness这是他们的经验之谈is a result of their experiences.有可靠证据显示 并非每一个人的So there is counter evidentce that shows that not everyone,幸福水平都取决于基因level of wellbeing is determined by their genes.事实上 有研究In fact,there is research显示基因很重要 影响甚多that shows yes genes do matter and they matter a lot,探讨改变的时候我们再谈这问题as we'll talk about during the week on change.还有其他因素和基因一样重要Other things matter as well.像Lykken和Tellegen那样 人们常错误地And the error that Lykken and Tellegen and many others make概括出一个结论 "变化是不可能的"when they generalize and say "change is not possible"00:59:59,050 --> 01:00:00,我称之为"大众错误"is what I call "the error of the average".平均而言Yes,on average,当研究这40或50组被分开抚养的双胞胎when you look at this group of 40 or 50 twins reared apart,大体看来when you look at the average,他们是一样的they are just about the same.然而 没有单独来看However,that's not looking at the individuals因为 虽然他们大多数是非常相似的because while many of them are the same,但并不是全部都一样not all are the same.这让我想起一个统计学笑话It reminds me of a joke about the statistician在一个平均水深为10英寸的游泳池里 谁会被淹死who drowned in a pool with an average height of 10 inches.只知道平均值You see you cannot tell the height or the depth rather并不知道游泳池的水深of a pool based on the average.由于该池平均10英寸深Because that pool may be average of 10 inches,或许它某些区域有20英尺深but maybe it has places that are 20 feet deep,如果它是一个大水池的话if it's a large pool.同样 当你平均地看这些双胞胎The same when you look at the average of individuals and twins.大体来说 他们都极其相似The majority on average,they are extremely similar.但也有少数的异常值But there are also outliers.很多时候 这个异常值And very often,it's the outliers,这些差异最有趣the differences that are the most interesting.因为他们Because they stretch—不只延伸了我们的想象 还让我们能理解not just our imagination-- they stretch our ability to understand怎样的时间和地点 有可能产生变化when and where change is possible.当我们看到了例外-The question when we see exceptions,无论是在Lykken和Tellegen的研究whether it's the Lykken and Tellegen study,还是别的出现了例外的研究-where we do see exceptions—当发现不是所有的双胞胎都一样not all twins were the same,主要的问题majority were,but not all—已不再是 改变是否有可能the question is no longer whether or not change is possible,而是怎样实现这种改变but rather how is change possible.例外证实了那个规律Once again,the exception proves the rule.认为"改变是不可能"的And the research that argues研究是有害的that it's not possible to change,is detrimental.设想一个8岁的女孩Think about an eight year old girl,她很忧伤who's very unhappy,然后在杂志上读到那个研究and then reads some magazine about that study,研究告诉她 基本上你的基因决定了一切saying that basically you are genetically set point你与生俱来的一切 将伴随你终生what you are born with is there for life.她会更忧伤She's unhappy.她只有8岁 但会觉得非常焦虑与痛苦She feels anxious and miserable as an 8 year old.她就会想And she says to herself,"我的人生就是这样 我生来不幸""That's it. That's my lot in life. I was born unlucky."那很可能会成为一个自我实现的预言And that,very often,becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.她始终不快乐And she remains unhappy.有时这研究让她比以前更不快乐Sometimes it even makes her less happy than she was before.因为现在她简直是绝望了Because now she's also helpless.改变是可能的Change is possible.你知道我经常说You know I often say that我是教积极心理学的最佳人选I am the right the person to teach positive psychology.为什么?Why?因为我不是生来就有"快乐基因"Because I wasn't born with "happy genes".从遗传学上讲 我天生就I was born with,genetically speaking,比较容易焦虑relatively high level of anxiety,容易得抑郁症inclination toward rumination,这是经过测试证实的over-examination—在后面的课程上我们会谈到we'll talk about that later in the course.我之所以研究积极心理学I went into the positive psychology,探索心理学领域into the field of psychology,正如我第一节课时提到的as I mentioned in the first lecture,是因为我不快乐because I was unhappy here.随着时间的推移 出现了很多这类研究And over time,as a result of many of these studies,由于提出了正确的问题result of examination result of asking also the right questions,我变得更快乐I have become happier.个人层面上 是有可能变得更快乐So on a personal level,I know it's possible to become happier.现在的我比15年前的我更快乐Now I am happier today than I was fifteen years ago我希望15年后的我when I started. I hope to be happier 15 years比今天的我更快乐from today than I am today.这是个终身的过程It's a life-long process.但这是有可能的 很多人证实了这是有可能的But it is possible. And many people show that it's possible.而那些认为这不可能的人And those who argue it's not possible他们用科学来争论and use science to argue for that,很多时候 只有阻碍作用而毫无帮助very often,are hurting more than helping the field.最近Lykken和TellegenNow by the way Lykken and Tellegen were interviewed受到《时代》杂志的采访 谈"快乐"问题recently in TIME magazine issue of happiness.下面是他们说的几句话Let me quote to you what they said.2005年 Lykken说This is in 2005-- Lykken:"我作了一个愚蠢的声明"I made a dumb statement.显然 我们能改变快乐水平 变得更高或更低"It is clear that we can change happiness levels,up or down."于是他们背弃了原来的声明So they went back on their statement.这个声明轰动一时It was a sensational statement at the time.改变当然是可能的It certainly is possible.我们怎样做更负责任的研究So how do we do research that's more responsible,怎样杜绝研究产生坏影响?that does not lead to detrimental results?同时 研究必须是真实的And at the same time,true.我们并不是要"发明"研究We don't want to invent research.研究的目的在于查明事实Research is about identifying things现实中真正发生了的事实that really occur/happen in reality.首先 我认为在健康研究方面So one of the first things that I'll argue for in terms of主要的问题是"让我们注重可行的方法"healthy research is "let's also focus on what is working".这是我们过去探讨过的问题That's first thing that we discussed in the past lecture.第二 我认为The second thing that I will argue for除了要研究可行的方法 还要研究最优秀的个体in addition to studying what works is also to study the best.为什么说"最优秀的个体"呢?What do I mean by best?我们不但要研究人们因何快乐Let's not just study what makes people happy.不要只是研究快乐的人Let's not just study happy people.不要只是研究快乐良好的爱情Let's not just study happy relationships and good relationships.让我们研究的最快乐的人Let's study the happiest people.让我们研究最成功的爱情Let's study the most successful relationships从中学习借鉴and learn from that.这是个与大众研究That is a radically different approach完全不同的研究方法than studying just the average.我想说的是 不要研究大众Because what I am saying here is "let's not study the average",研究快乐指数最高的5%的人let's study the top five percent这样就可以更好地理解这一现象so that we can understand the phenomenon better.这就是Abraham MaslowThe person who talks about this is Abraham Maslow.提出的"成长尖端统计学"When he talked about "growing-tip" statistics.以下这话引自他的书Let me read to you-- this is taken from his book:"设计出这类调研是为了"What this kind of research design means改变我们对统计的观念is a change in our conception of statistics,尤其是对抽样调查的看法and especially of sampling theory.我非常支持What I am frankly espousing here'成长尖端统计学'is what I have been calling "growing-tip statistics,"我的头衔来自以下的研究发现taking my title from the fact最优秀的遗传基因会在that it is at the growing tip of a plant幼苗的成长尖端出现"that the greatest genetic action takes place."他的意思是What he's saying is that"让我们学习圣人"let's study the sages,the saints,非凡的人"the extraordinary people,the arrowhead"这样能帮助我们了解so that we can understand and realize人类的潜能the potential in all people.我再引述他另一句更长的话Let me quote him in greater length.这话非常重要 是我作这个研究的原因This is very important,which is why I am doing it:"如果想知道人类最快能跑多快"If we want to know how fast a human being can run,那从好的样本中测出平均数是then it is no use to average out the speed of a "good sample"没用的of the population;而应该收集田径类奥运冠军的信息it is far better to collect Olympic gold medal winners看他们能跑多快and see how well they can do.如果想知道心灵成长的可能性If we want to know the possibilities for spiritual growth,人类价值增长或道德发展的可能性value growth or moral development in human being,那我认为 我们可以研究then I maintain that we can learn most最道德或圣洁的人by studying our most moral,ethical,or saintly people.整体来说 我认为人类历史On the whole I think it fair to say that human history是人性逐渐缺失的过程的is a record of the ways in which human nuture一个记录has been sold short.人性的潜在极限The highest possibilities of human nature实际上一直被低估了have practically always been underrated.显然 我们平常称之为'正常'的东西Certainly it seems more and more clear that what we call "normal"在心理学上 实际是种大众精神病理in psychology is really a psychopathology of the average,看上去平平无奇却又非常广泛so undramatic and so widely spread我们甚至没有注意到它"that we don't even notice it ordinarily."你们明白You see,他话里的含义吗?the implications of what he's saying here?01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:34,770基本上 他的意思是Essentially what he's saying is"不要只研究为什么大多数人失败"let's not just study why do most individuals fail;让我们也研究为什么有些人let's also study why do some-- not many—1203但为什么有的人尽管条件恶劣也能成功"but why do some individuals succeed despite the circumstances".不要只研究整体Let's not study just the average整体看来的话 人是不能改变的that says that people can't really change.让我们来研究改变了的人Let's study those people who have changed,真的改变了自身生活who have literally transformed their lives和身边其他人生活的人and those lives around them.这是个激进的研究方法This is a radical approach to research.对研究我们自身来说This is a radical approach to the search,这也是个激进的方法to studying ourselves as well.因为很多时候 如果我们只研究平均水平Because very often,if we only study the average,那就只会看到平均的结果 只看到几何形状we only see the average,we only see the geometric shapes完全忽略了汽车上的孩子and completely missed the children on the bus.很多时候And very often,最紧迫的问题的答案the answer to some of our most pressing questions出人意料lies in the extraordinary—就在汽车的孩子身上lies on the children on the bus.除了我还有其他人Now does anyone other than me—我承认我属于这一类because I admit that I fall into this category—但有谁在听到我说的这些话时but anyone other than me feel a little bit disease感到不舒服吗?when I talk about this?说真的 当我谈到Seriously,a little bit disease when I talk about"让我们集中精力研究最优秀的个体 圣人 非凡的人""let's focus on studying the best—有人感到不舒服吗?the saint,the sages,the extraordinary"?我觉得不大舒服I feel disease.你们有些人应该也有这感觉I'm sure some of you feel that too.因为这难道不是精英主义吗?Because after all,isn't that elitist?我们不是应该研究普罗大众吗?Shouldn't we study the average因为我们关心的不只是精英because we concern not just with elites?我们关心的是普罗大众We are concerned with the average.以下的问题有两个原因So there are two answers to that—我为什么还要继续说?我必须承认why I still maintain,and I must admit每次教到或想到这个统计I still feel some disease every time I teach this,我就觉得有点不舒服every time I think about this and I think too,01:09:32,470 --> 01:09:34,440研究最优秀的个体 为什么如此重要why it is so important to study the best,为什么成长尖端统计学why the "growing-tip" statistics is如此重要 我要建议such an important approach to research that I encourage大家使用my students to carry out.首先First of all,因为它不是排除了普罗大众because it is not to the exclusion of the average.就像积极心理学不是说 排除不可行的事Just like positive psychology does not say "let's exclude排除病理研究"what's not working; let's exclude study of pathology".同样 成长尖端统计学不是提倡Similarly,"growing-tip" statistics is not saying"我们别研究大众了""let's not study the average".它提倡也去研究最优秀的个体It says "let's also study the best".因此在这问题上无须计较研究对象是不是精英So this is the first thing to alleviate the concern of elitism.第二点 更为重要的是The second issue,the second response is even more important.研究最优秀的个体 能让每个人从中受益Because everyone benefits,when we study the best.而所谓的"大众"And the "average"-- whatever that means,在这种研究中the "average" benefits even more"大众"比"精英"受益更多than the best of this kind of studies.为什么呢?Why?例如 对适应力的研究For example: the study of resilience.我们本可以继续研究几百年来的We could have gone on and studied the average at-risk population平均受危人群for decades and centuries.应该会取得一点点进展And very little advances would have been made.事实证明进展甚微Very little advances were made.只有当我们开始研究It was only when we started to study这些"最优秀"的个体 成功的孩子those "best" examples,those successful kids,那些"超级"孩子those "super" kids as they were initially named.只有当我们开始研究这些It was only when we started to study those才能了解如何帮助到整体that we actually understood how we can best help that population.只要将心理韧性研究应用到生活中And once we applied our studies-- the resilience issue,每个人受益良多everyone benefited and continued to benefit from it.这就是个成长尖端统计学的研究实例That's an example of "growing-tip" statistics research.那关于冥想的研究呢?Or how about the study of meditation?我想研究冥想So I want to study how to meditate.是不是可以在哈佛大二学生里随机抽样Do I go out to Harvard yard and take a random sample来研究冥想?of sophomores to study meditation?还是去西藏的山顶Or do I go to a mountain top in Tibet研究冥想了几十年的人?and study the people who have been doing it for decades?当然我该去研究他们Of course I go and study them!的确有心理学家这样做过This is exactly what psychologists did!他们研究了冥想者的大脑And they studied their brain—谈到冥想时再谈这问题we'll talk about it when we talk about meditation—通过研究说明他们的大脑and they illustrated how their brain如何通过冥想来转换is transformed through meditation.像心理学家on Kabat ZinnPsychologists,like Jon Kabat Zinn,Richard Davidson和Herbert BensonRichard Davidson and Herbert Benson,能从这些最优秀的个体中吸取经验were able to take what they learned from these extraordinary,并应用到普通人的生活中best individuals and apply it to other people's lives如果我每天冥想15或20分钟so that now I benefit from meditation就能从中受益when I do it for 15 minutes or 20 minutes a day.千千万万的"普罗大众"And millions of other people,"the average",因对最优秀的个体的研究benefit a great deal because of the study of the best,而受惠of the "growing-tip".那爱情呢?How about relationships?你能想象Can you imagine对整个人类历史上的恋爱关系进行研究a study of relationships throughout human history并求平均值吗?that focuses on the average?人类史上的普通恋爱关系是指什么?What's the average relationship in human history?人类史上的普通恋爱关系The average relationship in human history其一是女人是被压制的一方is one in which the woman is subjugated.这就是人类史上的普通恋爱关系That's the average relationship in human history.如果我们只研究这种恋爱关系呢?Now what if we just study that?是否有帮助?Would that be helpful?不 John Stuart Mill这样的人No,it was when people like John Stuart Mill,研究了他自身的恋爱关系who studied his relationships这在当时是极不寻常的which was at the time extraordinary,研究过后他发现恋爱关系能改变realized the potential of what all relationships can be他这本书是以女性主导地位为题的that he wrote his book on subjugation of women,这本书是19世纪最重要的书之一one of the most important books是女权运动和平等运动的of the 19th century that has led to the feminist movement导火线and to the equality movement.01:13:23,870 --> 01:13:25,370如果他只研究普通的恋爱关系呢?What if he only studies the average?那样对人际关系有帮助吗?Would that help relationships?完全没有Not at all.那教学呢?How about teaching?要了解如何教学 你想怎样做?What do you want to do in order to learn about teaching—研究平均水平的教师还是研究Marva Collinsgo and study the average teachers or go and study Marva Collins然后将Marva Collins的经验应用到所有老师身上?and then apply what Marva Collins does to all teachers?当着眼于研究最优秀的人体时 每个人都得益Everyone benefits when we focus on the tip of stamen—这就是为什么Maslow说人性this is why Maslow said human nature和人的潜能会被削弱and human potential has been sold short,如果我们只研究平均水平的话when we only study the average.同样涉及到研究我们个人的最大长处It's also about studying our personal best,而不仅是研究其他人的最大长处not just other people's best,无论是不是我们的最佳经验whether it's our personal best experiences because因为研究我们的最开心if we study our best experiences when we are at our happiest,最成功when we are at our most successful,恋爱关系最佳时的状态when we thrive the most within the relationship,那我们也可以从中学习并应用到将来we can learn from it and apply it to our future as well.当我们研究平均水平 我们只是描述日常生活When we study our average,we are describing our lives.研究我们当中最优秀的个体时When we are studying the best within ourselves,我们潜意识里在学习we are potentially prescribing.Maslow又说:"虽然他们人数少Maslow again: "Few in number though they be,但我们可以学到很多有用的东西we can learn a great deal about values从对这些最优秀from the direct study of these highly evolved,最成熟的 心理最健康的个体的研究当中most mature,psychologically healthiest individuals,和对大众的峰值的研究当中可以知道and from the study of the peak moments of average individuals,他们达到了短暂的自我实现"moments,in which they become transiently self-actualized."如果我们自己吸取这些经验If we learn from these experiences in ourselves,那么问题就不再是 是否有可能the question is no longer whether or not it's possible越来越多地体验它to experience it more and more in our lives.而是"怎样去体验它"The question is "how is it possible to experience it".好Alright.我们讨论过改变自己So we talked about changing ourselves,为什么成长尖端统计学how it's possible the "growing-tip" statistics会是积极心理学研究中的which is the second significant idea第二个重要理念within research in positive psychology:第一个重要理念是"研究可行的事"first significant idea is "let's study what works"第二个重要理念是"研究最优秀的个体"the second significant idea is "let's study what works best".但这是关乎个体的改变But this is about individual change.那社会变革呢?How about societal change?最后我想介绍以下这项研究I want to share with you at the end today a study,心理学最有名的研究one of the most famous studies in the field"剑桥-萨默维尔青年学习心理学"called "the Cambridge-Somerville Youth Study psychology".这项研究从上世纪30年代开始This was the study that was run,由哈佛大学与麻省理工学院共同进行starting in the 1930s right here between Harvard and MIT,这些人拥有最高的思维were the best minds—心理学思维 哲学思维 心理医生psychological minds,philosophical minds,psychiatrists—他们聚在一起讨论got together and said,"让我们做一个劳斯莱斯计划吧""let's create the Rolls-Royce—there wasn't a Rolls-Royce then—"这是能想到的最佳干预方案"but best intervention program that we can think of."他们没有金钱方面的限制There was no limit in terms of how much money was put into it.他们的一切要求都得到了满足As much as they needed,他们从受危人群中选了250名孩子they got and they chose 250 kids from an at-risk population.干预不是快速修复And the intervention is not a quick fix,不是能一夜改变的  他们实行五年干预overnight change,"we can" seminar-- five-year intervention.他们所做的是And here is what they got.工作人员每月两次探访受试者Twice a month,case workers visited them,帮助他们处理家庭中的冲突helped them deal with the conflicts in the family,以及处理日常生活中的问题helped them deal with issues in their lives.他们中有一半人得到了学院的辅导Half of them had academic tutoring,those who needed it—只要有需要 就能得到学术帮助got help,academic help.精神科医生也是Psychiatric attention—谁有需要 医生都随时候命all those who needed it,they were there.你可尽情利用这些资源No limits on how much you needed it.无论你需要什么 这些精英都能满足你Whatever you needed,you got from the best minds in the field.他们加入了童子军 基督教青年会They joined the boy scouts,YMCA,或其他的青年运动 获益良多other youth movements,benefited a great deal,从这些经验可看出来supposedly from these experiences.他们得到了一切They got everything.这简直是梦寐以求的治疗This would be a dream treatment—不仅在20世纪30年代 即使在今天也是not just in the 1930s,today as well.心理学家做梦也会梦到这些This is what psychologists dream about at night.这项研究就是这样进行的Just introduce this.调查结果非常重要And then measuring outcomes was as serious as the program itself.还有一个随机分派项目There was a random assignment—有另外250个孩子 他们什么也没得到there were 250 kids who got nothing,也列为了研究对象who were also studied,就像受到"五年干预"的孩子一样just like the kids who got the five-year intervention were studied—250名对照组的孩子250 kids in the control group.40年的追踪调查40 years follow-up.这调查不只是今天 明天或五年内的事This was not just about today,tomorrow for the five years;而是研究了他们的大半生they followed them through much of their lives.这是一项非常严谨的研究This was serious study.这是严谨的干预This was serious intervention.其结果令人震惊And the results were shocking.即使所有参与这项研究的人-Even though all those who participated in this study—无论是心理健康学者whether it was the mental health workers,哲学家 心理学家whether it was the philosophers,psychologists,教授还是精神科医生-the professors and the psychiatrists—都说这是最佳 最高效的研究方案praise the program as the best,as highly effective,但当他们看到原始的样本数据when they looked at the raw objective data,调研结果让他们震惊the results were shocking.少年犯罪Juvenile offenses:对照组与干预组没有区别control group versus intervention group-- no difference.超过三分之一有案底Over a third had official records超过20%犯轻罪 无案底and 20 more percent had unofficial records for misdemeanors.在少年犯罪方面两组并无差异No difference in juvenile offenses.成人后的犯罪率Adult offenses later on in their lives.同样没有区别Again,no difference.20%以上的犯罪率Over 20 percent offenses—无论是对财产或对人所犯的罪whether against property or against person—在这两组之间in both groups: the 250 here versus 250 here,样本规模相同的两组间which is significant sample size.并无差异No difference whatsoever.其他测量数据显示other measures:身体健康和心理健康 两组没有区别physical health and mental health—no difference whatsoever.酗酒方面两组有显著差异But finally,there was a significant difference on alcoholism,酗酒人数有差异the number of people who became工作地位有差异alcoholic later on in life as well as job status—成为白领的人数how many people were able to两组有差异getting to do "the white collar" jobs.所以至少还是有成果的So at least there are results there.至少发现了几点显著的结果At least they found statistically significant results当发现这几个差异时when they came to that.那很棒吧That's good,right?其实不尽然Not at all.这些研究结果被扭曲了Because these results were "in the wrong direction",这项研究实际表明 干预组酒鬼数量meaning there were alcoholics in the intervention group比对照组更多than in the control group;1425对照组更多人there were more people in the control group在工作上表现出色making it at work "raising their status at work"相较干预组而言than in the intervention group.换而言之 干预弊大于利In other words,intervention did more harm than good.理想主义 良好意愿 钱财 都是不切实际的Idealism,good intention,a lot of money wasn't practical.很多关注这项研究的人Now many people who look at this study—这是一个开创性的研究 心理学史上this is a seminal study—very few studies很少如此重要的研究in the history of psychology that were that serious.他们认为"社会变革应该是不可能的"They say,"well,societal change is probably not possible".再给我一分钟 快讲完了Give me one minute and I'll finish.他们认为 社会变革是不可能的Societal change is not possible,they say.是吗?Is it?首先 例外是存在的 我们中也有例外First of all,there are exceptions and we have exceptions这证实了规则-有一个真正可行的方案that prove the rule--there are programs that actually work,无论是Karen Reivich的研究whether it's the work again of Karen Reivich还是宾夕法尼亚大学Martin Seligman的"适应力计划"and Martin Seligman from U Penn,"resilience program",Marva Collins肯定是个例外whether it's Marva Collins who's certainly an exception,她显示了干预是如何起作用的who shows how interventions work.想想以下这个有趣的问题And it's interesting to think aboutMarva所做的事与那项研究的区别the difference of what Marva Collins does,她没有给学生权利意识or she doesn't give the students in sense of entitlement,她赞扬他们 给他们严厉的爱or she praises them but she gives them hard love而不是免费的午餐as opposed to free lunch,她没有按需要来将他们分类or she doesn't label them as needy那项研究大概是根据需要来划分孩子的and the study perhaps labeled these kids as needy.有许多差异There are many differences.但研究这个例外的关键是But the keys to study this exception大家坐在一切and for practical idea is to come together说"什么是可行的?我们研究最好的吧and to say "what is working? Let's study the best;研究可行的事 将它应用到生活中"let's study what works and then apply it."我们将这思想传播出去Let's spread the word.我们根据Maslow20世纪50年代所说的来行事Let's do what Maslow talked about back in 1950s.他表明"曼哈顿计划"反驳了What he suggested is "Manhattan-Project-type attacks当时最大的问题upon what I consider to be the truly Big Problems of our time,这不仅是对心理学 甚至对所有人类都not only for psychology but for all human beings带来了历史紧迫感"with any sense of historical urgency".曼哈顿计划中 他们创造了原子弹The Manhattan Project,when they created the atomic bomb无论你是否同意and whether or not you agree with这计划the Manhattan Project normatively.很快就说完One second. I'm almost done.积极地说 他们汇集了最优秀的人才Positively,what they did there was bring together the best minds奥本海默 基拉特 费米费曼 波尔Oppenheimer,Zillart,Fermi Feinman,Bore—联合他们 共同拯救自由世界bring them together with a mission of saving the free world.无论你是否同意这计划Again whether you agree or not with the project积极来说 它都是最伟大的计划is beside the point,it was the greatest,positively speaking,聚集起了最优秀的人才scientific project in history where the minds got together.这就是Maslow建议心理学家该做的事This is what Maslow is suggesting that psychologists do.同时也是积极心理学的目标This is also the aim of positive psychology,no less than this.让全世界的人们思考这些问题You get people around the world to think about these problems,实际的理想主义者these issues-- practical idealists研究可行的方法who will study what works,研究最好的个体 他们会带来改变who will study the best and through that,make a difference.下周再见I'll see you next week.
