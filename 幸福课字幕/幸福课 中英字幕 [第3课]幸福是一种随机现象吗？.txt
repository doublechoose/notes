幸福课 中英字幕 [第3课]幸福是一种随机现象吗？
早上好 同学们
Good morning,everyone.
今天是本学期正式开学的第一天
This semester has started,officially today.
很高兴在这看到你们
Glad to see you here.
我只想说几句话
Just a couple of announcement
还有向进修学院的同学们打声招呼
and also hi to the extension school students.
上次我们向新西兰的同学问好
Last time we say hi to New Zealand.
今天轮到爱尔兰的同学了
Today we are saying hi to Ireland.
现在先说这里的本科生和研究生
In terms of sectioning
分组问题
for the undergrads and graduate students here,
你们明天会收到Sean Achor的邮件
you'll get an email from Sean Achor tomorrow.
你们填好各自的想加入的小组
And you'll put in your section preference.
我们本周会分好小组
We are sectioning this weekend.
选择你最想加入的组非常重要
So it will be important that you submit your top preferences.
下周我们就开始
And next week we are starting.
还记得上节课的问题吗
Last time,if you remember the question that we ask,
最主要的问题是"为什么要学习积极心理学?"
the guiding question was "why positive psychology?"
我提到了三个原因
And I mentioned three reasons,
为何我们把它作为独立的研究 而不简单地
Why we need it as an independent field as opposed to just being
"研究一下幸福和爱情"
"well,let's do some studies on happiness,on relationships"
不像一贯人们所做的那样?
as it is always being done?
我们需要积极心理学是为了改变
The reason why we need positive psychology is to shift
现在的21比1这个比率
the pendulum from the 21:1 ratio that we have today:
每有一项关于抑郁或焦虑的研究
for every one study on depression or anxiety,
就有21项 对不起
we have 21 studies on-- sorry,
应该是每有一项关于快乐或幸福的研究
for one study on happiness or wellbeing,
就有21项关于抑郁或焦虑的研究
we have 21 studies on depression and anxiety.
我们想稍微改变这个比率
We want to shift the pendulum slightly.
我提过三个原因
And I mentioned three reason
关于为什么要改变这个比率
why we want to shift this pendulum despite the fact
尽管世界上越来越多人抑郁
that there are rising levels of depression around the world,
而焦虑就像是全球性流行病
that anxiety has become epidemic globally—
遍布美国 中国 澳大利亚 英国所有大学
on college campuses in United States,China,Australia,UK.
尽管如此 我还是认为我们该改变那比率
Despite that fact,I argue that we need to shift the pendulum
做更多"积极研究" 或者说
and do more "positive research",or in other words,
集中研究可行的事
research that focuses on what works.
原因在于
And the reason is—
我们之前讨论完的第一个原因是
the first reason that we gave and we are just finishing up is
我们提出的问题很重要
because the question that we ask,
无论它是不是我们的研究问题
whether it's the research questions that we ask,
或我们为自己所问的
or the questions that we ask of ourselves,
或为我们的伴侣问的
or our partners,matter.
如果我们只问同一类问题
And if our only questions,
或只是问"有哪些不如意的事?
or primarily our questions are "what is not working?
出什么问题了?
What is the problem?
为什么那么多孩子因为成长环境而堕落?"
Why are so many kids failing as a result of their circumstances?"
如果我们只问了这些问题
If we only ask these questions,
就会错过现实中很重要的部分
we will miss,literally miss an important part of reality,
像你们在练习中没看到公车上的孩子一样
just like you missed the children on the bus in the exercise.
你们大多数人都没看到
Most of you did.
如果我们也问积极问题
And if we also ask the positive question,
那就会出现新的可能性 新的探索
then some new possibilities,new quests open up,
就像他们对研究学者所问的一样
just like they did for the researchers when they started to ask
不再问"为什么有这么多人堕落?"
no longer "why do so many individuals fail?"
而问"那些人是怎样取得成功的?
but started to ask "what do some individuals do and succeed?
为什么有些人能成功
Why do some individuals succeed
即使成长环境恶劣?"
despite the unfavorable circumstances?"
我们会以Marva Collins的故事为例
And then we have the story of Marva Collins,
她的例子很典型 能说明很多观点
who exemplifies so many of themes
这些观点会贯穿我们整节课
that we'll talk about throughout the course.
Marva Collins所做的
What Marva Collins did
就是帮助她的学生从消极的受害者-
was help her students shift from the passive victim—
你是成长环境的受害者
you are victims of your circumstances,
是你的家庭教育 邻里关系 和社会环境的受害者
of your upbringing,neighborhood,country,
诸如此类的 从消极的受害者变成积极的作用者
whatever it is—from a passive victim to an active agent.
00:03:56,790 --&gt; 00:03:59,790
是的 那很困难 艰辛 不公平
Yes,it's difficult. It's tough. It's unfair.
但这是你自己的责任 没人会来帮你
However,it's your responsibility. No one is coming.
能否改变自己的人生 由你自己决定
It's up to you to make that difference in your life.
但她改变了千千万万人的人生
And she made a difference to thousands of people's lives
现在还在这么做
and continues to do so.
换句话说 如果我们看看芝加哥学院体制
In other words,if we look at the case of Chicago school system
Marva Collins就在那体制下执教
where Marva Collins was teaching,the conventional,
还是那个老问题
traditional question was-- if you remember—
"怎样才能让学生们在学校
"how can we keep these students in school
留得久一点?
for as long as possible?
如何让他们在10或12岁后还留在学校
How can we keep them in school beyond the age of 10 or 
让他们远离街头帮派?
so that they don't join street gangs?
让他们远离毒品和犯罪?"
So that they are not hurt by drugs or crime?"
"如何使他们安全地留在学校?"
"How can we keep them safe at school?"—
这是个很重要的问题 但还不只如此
An important question to ask. However,not enough.
Marva Collins重新定义这个问题
Marva Collins comes along and reframes the question.
她提出的问题是
And her question becomes
"我们如何培养学生 激发他们的潜能?"
"how can we cultivate the seed of greatness in our student?"
这问题改变了一切
And that,once again,made all the difference,
因为她看到了每个学生的潜能
because she saw the seed of greatness in each student.
她看到每个学生身上的优点和品德
She saw the strength,the virtues in each single student.
潜能 优点 品德 能力
A seed,a strength,a virtue,a competence
这些是其他老师没看到的
that other teachers did not see,
因为他们没提出这个问题
because they did not ask this question;
打个比方 他们只会问
because they asked,metaphorically speaking,
"你在屏幕上看到多少个几何图案?"
"how many geometric shapes do you see on the screen?"
他们完全忽略了车上的孩子
And they completely missed the children on the bus.
完全忽略了学生的潜能
They completely missed the seed of greatness.
如果我们看不见学生的潜能
And when we don't see the seed of greatness,
不去栽培它
when we don't water it and shed a light on it,
它就会枯萎而死
it withers and dies,
遗憾的是 大部分人类潜能都因此而被磨灭
which is unfortunately the fate of most human potential.
无论在哪 这都是大部分人类潜能的遭遇
Wherever we go,that is the fate of most human potential—
人与人之间 很多团体中
interpersonally,relationships,in most organizations,
很多大学里或人们自己 这些潜能都因被忽视而磨灭
in most universities,in most individuals.
疑问引起改变
Questions make a difference,
因此提问是非常重要的
which is why it is also important to ask
提出积极心理学的问题很重要
the positive psychology question,
也就是"健康创成"的问题
which is the salutogenic question:
"健康源于什么?成功源于什么?
"What is source of health? What is the source of success?
幸福源于什么?"
What is the source of wellbeing?"
这是第一个原因 而第二个原因是
So that's the first reason. The second reason—
在谈第二个原因时
before I go to the second reason,
如果Marva Collins今天在场
if Marva Collins is here today,
那她会问我们这个问题:
here's the question she would be asking us:
"我们如何在于自身和家人中
"How can we cultivate the seed of greatness
栽培伟大的种子
in ourselves and families,
如何在在社区和团体中 栽培伟大的种子
in our communities and organizations,
在国家和世界中呢"
in our nation and in our world?"
当我们提出这个极为重要的问题
When we ask this question-- this very important question,
就会看到之前没看到的潜能
suddenly we see possibilities that we didn't see before.
第二个研究积极心理学的原因
Second reason for having positive psychology's field of study
研究可行的事和
and focusing on what works and focusing on
研究快乐 人际关系 幸福的原因
research in happiness,relationships and wellbeing
是因为幸福不会因为驱除了忧愁
is because happiness does not spontaneously rise
而自动增长
when take unhappiness away.
幸福与忧愁 快乐与紧张
Now happiness and unhappiness,or happiness and neurosis,
精神病与抑郁 都有很大的内在联系
psychosis and depression,are interconnected,of course.
要快乐并不容易
It's very difficult to be happy
如果我们感觉很压抑或焦虑
if we are experiencing severe depression or anxiety.
就是说他们必然是有关联的 然而
So they are certainly interconnected. However,
单单摆脱焦虑与压抑并不会
just getting rid of the anxiety and the depression will not in
使我们快乐
and of itself make us happy,
这一点算是传统的常识
which is the conventional wisdom today,
是很多从业的心理学家
which is the conventional wisdom
会了解的一点常识
of many psychologists practicing psychologies—
131
"摆脱抑郁
"Well,let's just get rid of that depression
一切都会变好的"
and everything will be fine."
事实并非如此
It won't.
解释这一点的一个例子是
The analogy to explain this is think about
享受美食的能力
the ability to enjoy food.
美味大餐
A gourmet meal.
如果我们消化不良 那很难享受美食
Now if we have indigestion,it's very difficult to enjoy food.
因此我们得先治好消化不良
So yes,we first need to get rid of the indigestion.
然而 治好消化不良
However,that in and of itself
不保证我们就能享受美食
does not guarantee us that we enjoy food.
要享受美味大餐 就得出去吃
We have to go out and eat the gourmet food to enjoy it.
只是治愈消化不良远远不够
Just getting rid of indigestion is not sufficient.
还要做好下一步的事
We need the next step.
可以从多方面来看我们的经验
In many ways you can look at most of our experiences,
在心理连续谱上看有效心理经验
psychological effective experiences on a continuum,
有时候会跌倒0以下
where some of them fall below the zero,
不愉快或痛苦的经历
the negative experiences or the painful experiences
积极或愉快的经历
and the positive or the pleasurable experiences
分别在0与正值之间
between the zero and the positive.
紧张 愤怒 焦虑 压抑 精神病
Neurosis,anger,anxiety,depression,psychosis—
这些消极和痛苦的方面
to name a few-- on the negative side,the painful side;
幸福 满足 愉悦 兴奋 快乐
wellbeing,satisfaction,joy,excitement,happiness
属于另一方面
on the other side
也就是积极心理学研究的方面
which is the side of positive psychology studies.
再强调一次 摆脱消极
Again,getting rid of the negative
不能保证我们变得积极
does not guarantee us the positive,
因此早在19世纪40年代
which is why already in the 1840s,
梭罗
David Henry Thoreau (should be Henry David Thoreau),
认为 大多数人都活在沉默的压抑中
wrote that most men lead lives of quiet desperation.
这是没错的
It's Ok. There's nothing really wrong.
但平克弗洛伊德说过
But it's just somewhere there in the words of Pink Floyd
"人们在舒适地麻木" 舒适地麻木
"people are comfortably numb". Comfortably numb.
还不止如此 我们要怎样摆脱这种"舒适地麻木"?
Not enough. How can we get beyond that "comfortably numb"?
要怎样摆脱"沉默的压抑"?
How can we get beyond that "quiet desperation"?
得到振奋 快乐 幸福?
To excitement,to joy,to happiness?
为了达到这目的 我们需用心经营这些情感因素
In order to do that,we need to cultivate these traits.
再说一次 幸福不会自动出现
Once again,they don't spontaneously emerge
并不是没有痛苦就能感到幸福
once the painful experiences go away.
因此我们才需要积极心理学
And that is why we need positive psychology.
积极心理学本质上就是健康模型
Positive psychology essentially focuses on the health model,
健康本源学
Salutogenesis.
健康 生理 心理 情感之源是什么?
What is the source of health,physical,psychological,emotional?
我们如何让人们从智力上 情感上
How do we get people to flourish,intellectually,emotionally,
心理上 人际关系上 人格上全面发展?
psychologically,interpersonally,intra-personally?
我们如何让他们全面发展 而不仅仅是帮他们摆脱
How do we get them to thrive beyond just getting rid
生活中不如意的事?
of what is not working in their lives?
根据该模型 我们在许多层面上都走了极端
And under that model we see,to extremes on many levels.
第一个层次:
Here,the first level:
我们是否重视缺点
do we focus on weaknesses,
也就是疾病模型所说的我们要摆脱的缺点
which is the disease model,say let's get rid of weaknesses?
或者说 我们是否专注于优点?
Or do we focus on strength?
当你问别人这个问题
While you ask people this question,
盖洛普组织做了这项研究
and this was done by the Gallup organization.
一项全球民意调查显示
A poll-- global poll,
无论是在日本 中国 美国或欧洲
whether it's in Japan,China,United States or Europe:
大多数人认为 如果要成功
most people think that it's more important
注重自己的缺点比优点更重要
to focus on their weaknesses if they are to succeed.
大错特错
Big mistake.
那些同样注重自己优点的人
The people who focus primarily,not only-- remember the "also"—
改变那个比率的人 更注重优点的人
who shift the pendulum,who focus more on their strength,
不仅更开心 从长远来看他们也
are not only happier,they are also,on the long run,
更成功
more successful.
这同样适用于领导能力
It applies to leadership as well.
积极心理学认为 我们至少
Positive psychology says let's focus also
注重优点的程度要和注重缺点一样多
on our strength at least as much.
无论是组织还是个人自身
In an organization,as well as on the individual level,
我们最注重的是克服缺点
are we focusing most on overcoming deficiencies
还是培养才能?
or building the competencies—
我们擅长什么 并是否取得了进步?
what we are good at-- and getting better at it?
个人或组织的自然倾向是什么
What our natural inclination,individually or organizationally—
我们是否更注重自己的自然倾向?
do we focus on that and then build on that?
注重健康的同时也要注重幸福
Again,tie to success as well as wellbeing,
如果我们是较为积极的话
if we are more toward the positive side.
我们如何活出自己的精彩?
How do we live our lives?
如何摆脱痛苦的经历
Running away from painful experiences?
或积极寻找快乐?
Or actively seeking pleasure?
如何摆脱悲伤?
Running away from unhappiness?
还是遵循宣言(独立宣言)行事
Or adhering to the Declaration (Declaration of Independence)
追求幸福?
and pursuing happiness?
举个例 下面的两种人看起来非常相似
Now that may look quite similar-- for example,
某人可能每周工作80小时
someone may be working 80 hours a week,
他习惯逃避 逃避家事
running away from something-- running away from issues at home,
逃避处理私事
running away from dealing intra-personal issues
但他看起来却和下面这种人一样
and then may look exactly the same as the person
她每周工作80小时 对工作
who works 80 hours a week and who's extremely passionate
充满热情
about what she does.
表面看来他们一样 但他们的内心感觉很不同
May look the same but from the inside,they feel very different.
一种是疾病模型
One is the disease model:
让我们逃避不如意的事
let's run away from what is not working.
另一种是健康模型
The other is the health model:
让我们追求激情 追求喜欢做的事
let's pursue my passions,what I love to do.
对疾病模型而言 最优水平是零
The disease model,the optimum level is the zero:
我们都平平安安 别受伤就好了
let's just be Ok; let's just not hurt.
再说一次 免受伤害是非常重要的
And again,that's important to get rid of hurt.
摆脱抑郁非常重要
It's important to get rid of depression.
但依健康模式来看 这是不够的
But with the health model,they are saying that's not enough;
让我们超越那种程度
let's go beyond that.
让我们兴奋起来 快乐起来
Let's go to the excitement,to the fun.
因为理想状态并不只是放松
Because the ideal is not just a tensionless state.
它是创造性的紧张状态
It is the creative tension.
我们会谈到它 会读到相关的文章
We'll talk about it. We'll read about it.
当我们"沉迷"之时 那就是我们感到兴奋
When we do "flow". Flow is the state where we are excited,
为所做之事着迷的状态
where we are engaging what we are doing,
那样大大超越了"舒适地麻木"
where it's much more than being "comfortably numb".
事实上 在那种状态下会有点不舒适
In fact,it's a little bit uncomfortable.
那是在我们舒适区之外的
It's being outside of our comfort zone.
可算是我们的延伸地带
It's being in our stretch zone—
不是会让人受伤的恐慌地带 而是延伸地带
not the panic zone,where it hurts-- the stretch zone,
其中有兴奋 还有点紧张
where there is excitement,where there's some nervousness.
还可能会有成长
There is also growth there.
所以 你的目的是什么?
So what do you want?
你想去哪?你要追求什么?
Where do you want to go? What do you want to pursue?
你想逃避愉悦吗?想逃避痛苦吗?
Do you want to run away from pleasure-- run away from pain?
你想逃避不快乐吗?
Do you want to run away from unhappiness?
还是你想追求幸福和快乐?
Or do you want to pursue happiness and pleasure?
你更注重你的不足之处
Do you want to focus primarily on your deficiencies
或缺点吗?
or your weaknesses?
还是更注重优点?
Or your strength?
什么是最有利的选择?什么是理想状态?
What is the optimum? what is the ideal?
有无形的障碍 零点吗?
Is there a glass ceiling-- the zero?
还是可以继续
Or can it go on and on—
寻找到更多的刺激 享受 激情?
more excitement,more enjoyment,more passion?
有一些关于健康模型的可怕说法
Now there's something frightening about the health model.
因为没有界线 如今它的使用程度
Because there is no limit and there is less prescription there
也远比疾病模型少
certainly today than in the disease model.
积极心理学
Positive psychology,
健康心理学的研究还处于初级阶段
the field of health psychology is in infancy.
而且有更多的研究是关于
There's much more research,
如何摆脱抑郁
much more advice on how to get rid of depression
如何发展自己的优点
and how do I pursue my strength.
但幸运的是 这就是为什么要学习积极心理学
But fortunately,again,this is why positive psychology as
大量的学者致力于
a network of scholars applying themselves
研究这些观点 它意义非凡
to these ideas and ideals. It's so important
因为今天你们会看到整个学期的概览
because today you'll see throughout the semester
有很多方法可以让我们的生活质量
that there are so many more tools that we can apply to our lives,
达到正值
to go beyond the zero.
这还不是全部
That's not all.
我说过有三个原因
So I said there are three reasons.
关键在于我们侧重点 侧重点创造现实
It's about where we focus,focus creates reality;
快乐并不只是对不快乐的否定
it's about happiness is not just a negation of unhappiness;
积极心理学之所以重要的第三个原因是
the third reason why positive psychology is important
积极心理学领域
is because positive psychology and the areas
还有与积极心理学
that we study and more importantly,
相关的领域
apply within the field of positive psychology,
不仅让我们从零点上升到正值
do not just take us from the zero to the positive.
积极心理学还帮助我们处理消极情绪
They also help us deal with the negative.
帮助我们处理焦虑不安
They help us deal with anxiety,
处理抑郁和痛苦的经历 及情感问题
depression and painful experiences and emotions.
当我们培养出积极性
When we cultivate the positive,
我们本质上是自我防御的
we are essentially focusing on prevention.
我解释一下
Let me explain.
过去10年多时间的研究发现
What has been found over the last 10 years
处理我们不断增加的抑郁病例
and a little bit longer is the most effective way of actually
个体的抑郁或焦虑
dealing with a rising levels of depression in our culture,
最有效方法是
with individual depression or anxiety is actually not to
不要直接专注于抑郁和焦虑
focus on the depression and anxiety directly—
这点也很重要
that is important as well.
事实证明 处理这种现象
It is found that the most effective way
最有效的方法是
of dealing with this phenomenon was actually
培养积极性和个人优点
to cultivate the positive,to cultivate personal strengths,
培育激情
to cultivate and identify one's passions,
提出这种问题"我人生中什么是有意义的?
to ask a question such as "what is meaningful to me in my life?
我的目的是什么?我为什么在这里?
What's my purpose? Why am I here?
毕业后我真正想做的是什么?"
What do I really,really want to do once I graduate?"
295
提出这些问题
People who ask these questions
并认真思考这些问题的人
and spend time on these questions,
所追求的
are much more likely to begin a quest
不是避免痛苦
that is not the avoid of painful emotions—
而是
no quest is—
追求更多快乐
but the quest is more enjoyable,more pleasurable,
使生活更有意义 更成功
more meaningful and also,more successful as it turns out.
更重要的是 我将"更成功"
But more importantly,more successful in
称之为"终极货币"
what I call the "the ultimate currency"—
正如快乐货币和幸福货币一样
just as the currency of happiness and wellbeing.
究其原因 是因为有两种不同的方法
The reason is because there are two different approaches
对付疾病 一是积极心理学方法
to deal with illness: one,the positive psychological approach is
它指的是 疾病相当于不健康
that the illness is the absence of health,
相对地 健康等于没疾病
as opposed to health is the absence of illness.
我们想一下疾病模式
I mean,think about the disease model.
疾病模式是 "我们感到不适是因为生病了"
The disease model is "we are sick because we are ill"—
听到吗?我们病了是因为我们在生病
do you listen to that? We are sick because we are ill.
真的很深奥
That was very profound.
你们可能要好好想一下这句话
You should think about it for a while here.
可能要给点时间大家消化这话
I'll let a time just to marinate it little bit so that you can.
我重新说一遍
Let me start that again.
如果治好病 就会变得健康
If we take away the illness,then we become healthy.
这是个传统的模型
That's the model,the conventional model.
把病治好 就会变得健康 这很好
Take away the illness. You'll become healthy. It's good.
积极心理学模型略有不同
The positive psychological model is slightly different.
它说的是
It is
"你生病了 是因为你的生活还不够健康
"you are ill because you don't have enough health in your life,
因为你不去追求那些让你健康的东西"
because you are not pursuing those things that make you healthy".
什么使你健康?
And what make you healthy?
这我之前已谈过 追求有意义的生活 人生的目的
The things I spoke about before: pursuing meaning,purpose;
培养健康的人际关系
cultivating healthy relationships.
如果不具备这些 疾病就会趁虚而入
If we don't have these things,that's when the illness comes in.
两种模型
Now the difference between the two models,
健康模型和疾病模型的差异
the health model and the disease model
不仅仅是语义上的
is more than just semantic.
这是Abraham Maslow所说的神经官能症
Here is Abraham Maslow talking about neurosis,
"神经官能症描述的是人能变成怎样
"Neurosis is a falling short of what one could have been
或是他该变成怎样
and even one could say,of what one should have been,
从生理上来说就是是
biologically speaking that is
一个人是否能顺利地成长和发展
if one had grown and developed in an unimpeded way.
人类和个人的潜能已经消失
Human and personal possibilities have been lost.
世界逐渐缩小 意识也是
The world has been narrowed and so has consciousness.
能力也被抑制"
Capacities have been inhibited."
我来解释一下这话的意思
Let me explain what he means here.
他是说 我们正在生病 是因为我们没有
What he means is that we are ill because we do not cultivate
尽力做好我们本该做到的事
what we are about enough.
我们没做到自我实现
We do not become self-actualized.
没做到该做的
We don't do what we are supposed to do.
我们削弱自身力量 因此才会生病
We diminish ourselves and that's when we become ill.
才会不适
That's when we are unwell.
这和疾病模型所说的有很大不同
This is very different from the disease model that says,
"好 你不舒服 那就治病去吧"
"Ok,you are unwell. Deal with that illness."
他说的是:"不 你不舒服
What he's saying: "No. You are unwell.
要注重健康 加强你的健康
Focus on your health. Strengthen your health.
因为你病了
Because you are ill,
因为你没有注重健康"
because you are not focusing enough on your health."
他将这称为
He calls that,and I quote,
"个人成长的失败"
"a failure of personal growth".
如果我们感到焦虑
That's when we experience neurosis.
如果我们不注重培养自己的能力
When we don't cultivate ourselves enough,
不注重培养自己的人际关系 就会失败
we don't cultivate our relationships enough,that's when we fail.
积极心理学研究的是关于
And what the positive psychology is all about is precisely that—
培育自身成长和积极性
cultivating personal growth,working on the positive.
我们研究积极性 它处于这一边
And we work on the positive on what comes of this side
大家可以在这上面看到
of the graph that you saw up there.
在积极的一方 当我们注重培养这些情感因素
On the positive side,when we cultivate these things,
就会助于我们更好地处理
it also helps us deal much better
消极因素
with the negative when dead arises.
我想引用Martin Seligman的话
I want to quote Martin Seligman,
他说过这样一句话
who talks about precisely this idea:
"在过去的十年
"In the last decade
心理学家关心的都是预防的问题
psychologists have become concerned with prevention.
怎样才能预防像抑郁症这样的心理问题
How can we prevent problems like depression
或年轻人中常出现的药物滥用或精神分裂症
or substance abuse or schizophrenia in young people
谁天生敏感脆弱 谁又是
who are genetically vulnerable or who live in worlds
制造这些问题的人?
that nurture these problems?
如何防止校园暴力
How can we prevent murderous schoolyard violence in children
这些暴力事件通常是由掌握武器 缺乏父母监管
who have access to weapons,poor parental supervision,
或受到教唆的孩子引起的
and a mean streak?"
他问了这个问题 根据疾病模型
Now he's asking this question and the disease model
我们需要帮助他们直接
response to this is we need to help them deal
处理抑郁症
directly with depression,
还有他们的焦虑和忧愁
with their anxiety and with their unhappiness
才能防止所有这些社会弊病
so that we can prevent all these social ills—
无论是暴力还是不快乐
whether it's violence,whether it's unhappiness.
他是这么说的
What he's saying here is the following:
"五十多年的经验告诉我们 疾病模型
"What we have learned over fifty years is that the disease model
不能让我们更有力地预防
does not move us closer to the prevention
这些严重问题
of these serious problems.
事实上 在预防方面取得的重大进展
Indeed the major strides in prevention
基本上来自一个观点
have largely come from a perspective focused
也就是注重培养能力 而非改正错误"
on systematically building competency,not correcting weakness."
换句话说 健康模型倡导
In other words,the health model:
培养能力
let's work on competencies.
增强自身长处 改善人际关系
Let's work on strength. Let's work on relationship.
帮助人们找到对自己人生有意义的事
Let's help them identify something meaningful in their life,
和他们的热情所在
their passion.
那就是我们将要致力做到的
And that's how we will,over time,
同样对克服消极因素 有所帮助
also help what comes off on the negative side.
健康模型与疾病模型不同
Health model versus the disease model
疾病模型提倡直接处理疾病的
that goes directly to deal with the disease.
Seligman不是说"排除"疾病模型
Now again,Seligman is not saying "to the exclusion of";
而是说也可以用健康模型
he's saying "also".
他还说
He continues,
我们已发现有些人类的力量
"We have discovered that there are human strengths
能抵抗心理疾病
that act as buffers against mental illness:
勇气 未来规划 乐观 人际技巧
courage,future-mindedness,optimism,interpersonal skill,
信念 职业道德 希望 诚实 毅力
faith,work ethic,hope,honesty,perseverance,
专注及洞察力 诸如此类
the capacity for flow and insight,to name several.
研究证实 乐观可帮助儿童和成人
We'v e shown that learning optimism prevents depression
预防抑郁和焦虑
and anxiety in children and adults,
使未来两年的发病率降低一半
roughly halving their incidence over the next 2 years.
同样 如果我们要防止
Similarly,I believe that if we wish to prevent drug abuse
青少年受不良的社会环境影响
in teenagers who grow up in a neighborhood
而滥用药物的情况
that puts them at risk,
但预防的效果不佳
the effective prevention is not remedial.
相反 它认定并放大了这个事实
Rather,it consists of identifying and amplifying
就是青少年们已滥用药物"
the strengths that these teens already have."
Marva Collins所做的就是
It's exactly what Marva Collins did:
注重健康并用心栽培它
focused on the health and cultivated it,
浇水 给予阳光并时刻关注它
watered it and shed a light to it,realized it.
对这些观点的探讨将贯穿整个课程
We'll talk about all these ideas throughout the course.
健康模式能做的就是-
What health model does—
这是我们这堂课着重讲的内容
this is the theme we go through all the course
培养能力
is cultivate capacity.
培养我们处理
It cultivates the capacity to deal
消极因素的能力
with the negatives when these arrive—
无论是人际关系上的消极和痛苦经历
whether it's negative and painful experiences in relationships,
还是我们自身的
or in ourselves.
那意味着什么 我为大家做两个类比
What does that mean? Let me draw two analogies.
培养能力就是创造一个强大的
Cultivating capacity is about creating a strong psychological
心理免疫系统
immune system.
这是Nathaniel Branden的观点
These are the words of Nathaniel Branden.
心理学免疫系统
Psychological immune system.
如果我们有强大的生理免疫系统会怎样?
What happens when we have a strong physical immune system?
这是否意味着我们不会生病?
Does it mean we don't get ill?
当然不是 还是会生病
Of course not. We do.
但这意味着我们不会常生病 就算病了
But it means that we get ill less often and when we do get sick,
也能恢复得更快
we recover more promptly.
这就是培养的力量
This is exactly what cultivating strength,
乐观 追求 意义 规划
optimism,sense of purpose,meaning,mindfulness—
正是这些因素的作用
this is exactly what these characteristics do.
他们会放大并改变
They enlarge transform—
我们看待和体验世界的方式
the way we see,the way we experience the world,
让我们突破框架 引发潜能
enlarge the capacity of the form and
使我们能更好地应对不可避免的困难
that's we are better able to deal the inevitable difficulties.
不可避免的困难的确存在
And there are inevitable difficulties.
没有谁的人生是一帆风顺的
No life is completely immune to those.
它可以增强我们的免疫系统
So it strengthens our immune system.
另一个类比是关于引擎的
And another analogy we can use is of an engine.
如果我们用的引擎很小
If we have a small engine,
想把车开上一个陡峭崎岖的山坡
and we have to pull the car up a steep hill,a difficult hill,
引擎很容易损毁 爆炸
the engine is more likely to collapse,to blow up.
但如果我们的引擎够大
Whereas If our engine is large,
要上那山就容易得多
we are much more likely to get up that hill,
不费吹灰之力就能做到
and to do it gracefully with relative ease.
所以我们在做的是 培养积极性
So what we are doing: we cultivate the positive;
按那个比喻来说 我们正在增强
we are strengthening our,metaphorically speaking,
心理"引擎"
psychological "engine";
我们能够更好将负值转化为零
and we are better able to deal with the negative to zero,
更别说还能变得更快乐
not to mention the fact that we are also able to become happier.
因为快乐不会自发而来
Because happiness does not just come spontaneously
不会因为消除了忧愁 就变得快乐
when we negate unhappiness.
我想说说我们这里的事
I want to go back to our local village.
记得上次
So remember last time
我提出的《哈佛克里姆森》杂志里的文章
I put up the article by the Crimson (Harvard Crimson magazine)
很可惜我找不到
that was unfortunately I couldn't find
更近期一点的 那是2004年的?
a more recent one-- that was 2004?
但今天的情况非常相似
But the situation is rather similar today.
那篇文章提到的一点是
And one of the things that the Crimson article said is that
我们需要为哈佛学生的心理健康投入更多
we need to put more resources into mental health at Harvard.
这点很重要的 我非常赞同
And that's important,I agree.
这只是其中一点
However,it's only part of the picture.
投入到其他一些地方
in some different places as well-- not only,as well.
因为只是投入资源
Because it's just not enough to put these resources in places
帮助我们应对抑郁 焦虑和忧愁
that help us deal with our depression and anxiety
是远远不够的
and unhappiness directly.
同样重要的是 投入资源
It is also important to put these resources in places
帮助我们培养自身能力
that help us cultivate capacity,
应对困难和艰辛的能力
the capacity to deal with these difficulties and hardships
这些困难一直存在并会继续出现的
when they arise and they will arise.
换句话说 必须在以下方面投入更多资源
In other words,there has to be more resources put in places
例如帮助学生发掘
such as helping students identify their passions
自己的兴趣
when they come here,
帮助学生发现人生的意义
helping students identify their sense of meaning in life,
使他们明确自己
helping students identify what they
真正想做的事
really,really,really want to do,
帮助他们克服那种诱惑
helping students overcome the pull,
身边常出现的诱惑
the external pull that is often there,
会让他们偏离自己的道路
taking them away from their core,
还有凿掉那些束缚
helping them chip away those limitations,
摆脱杂念 帮助他们找到自己的真实个性
those voices,helping students identify who they really are,
还有帮助学生了解自己的强项
helping students identify their strengths
并在哈佛实现一切
and pursuing those while here at Harvard.
所有这些能力
All these capabilities,
所有这些技能 大多数都
all these skills or skills that are mostly—
我不只是说哈佛
and I'm not just talking about Harvard—
而是全球范围内 没有一所学校会教这些技能
globally-- not taught in schools.
所以我们需要教他们
And we need to teach them.
这并不是说哈佛现在
This is not to say that what is going at Harvard
正投入大量资源的方面不重要
with numerous resources that we do have here is not important.
这些方面都非常重要的
It is very important.
举个小例子
Just take a small example:
学习咨询处
the Bureau of Study Counsel.
我不知道你们有多少人利用过该资源
I don't know how many of you have used that resource.
我念本科时已开始接触它
I've used it as an undergrad.
至今还在与他们一起做某些工作
I still use it now,doing some work with them.
去年我与他们合作过
I did some work with them last year.
他们真的很棒
And they are wonderful.
同时 我们还需要培养积极性
And at the same time,we also need to cultivate the positive,
探究如何让我们从零点升到正直
to think more of the zero to the positive side
该如何做
of the equation as well.
这就是积极心理学的作用
And this is what positive psychology does
我希望1504号课程在一定程度上会有帮助
and I hope this is what 1504 to some extent will help do.
总之
To summarize,
"积极心理学运动提醒我们
"the message of the positive psychology movement
这个领域已与过去不同
is to remind our field that it has been deformed.
心理学不仅是对疾病 弱点和伤害进行研究
Psychology is not just the study of disease,weakness,and damage
它也研究优点和美德
it also is the study of strength and virtue,
治疗不只是修复错误
Treatment is not just fixing what is wrong;
同时也要塑造正确的东西
it also is building what is right.
心理学关注的不仅仅是疾病或健康状况
Psychology is not just about illness or health;
还包括工作 教育 洞察力 爱 成长和玩乐
it is about work,education,insight,love,growth,and play.
在追求理想状态时
And in this quest for what is best,
积极心理学不会盲目主观
positive psychology does not rely on wishful thinking,
或自欺欺人 或敷衍了事
self-deception,or hand waving;
相反 它尝试用最科学的方法来探究
instead,it tries to adapt what is best in the scientific method
极其复杂的人类行为所表现出来的
to the unique problems that human behavior presents
特殊问题"
in all its complexity."
还涉及到如何将学校与社会连接起来
It's about bridging the Ivory tower and the Main Street
这个我认为最重要的领域
in the area that I believe is the most important one
对我们来说都有意义
and talks to each and every one of us.
好 我继续说下去
I want to move on now.
我想先说说下一节关于选择的课程
I want to move on to the next selective lectures—
两节或两节半课
two or two and a half lectures,
我将会谈到
where I am going to be talking about
本课程的基本前提
the basic premises of this course.
正如我刚才所说
As I said earlier,
本课程并不是积极心理学的调研课
this course is not a survey course of positive psychology.
这是关于选择"问题中的问题"的
It's very selective. It's about the question of questions.
有什么可以帮助我们个人
What can help us individuals,
帮助我们的社会更快乐 不是快乐 是更快乐
what can help our community become happier-- not happy,happier.
三个月后 期末时
So by the end of these three months semester,
你会变得更快乐
you are happier than you were before.
到学期末 你很可能比现在的你
You are from now,you'll be hopefully happier than you were
更快乐
at the end of the semester.
越来越快乐
And so on and so on.
基本前提是什么?
So what are the basic premises?
备课时我想和大家说些什么呢?
Where am I coming here when I think about this course?
我想为大家介绍
Well what I want to do is to share with you
五个基本前提
the five basic premises.
介绍这些前提 要从
And these premises are going to be presented as something and—
它的对立面说起
essentially it's opposite.
下面这些问题非常明确
So that were clear from the outset:
我们从哪里来 我从哪里来
where we are coming from,where I am coming from,
教学人员从哪里来
where the teaching staff is coming from—
了解这些后我们就能建立本课程的基础
and also so that we can build the foundation of the course.
记得一开始我就跟你们说过
Remember I talk those of you who were here the first time:
这课程就像个螺旋
this course is built like a spiral
内部的一切都是相关的
Everything is intra-connected,
第一节课讲到的内容
what I talked about in the first class is connected to
与今天要谈的课题有关
what I'm going to talk about today,
也和第19课有关
is going to be connected to lecture 19.
从许多方面来看 这个前提
So in many ways the premises,
跟我们开头的两节课有关
coupled with what we discussed in the first two lectures,
会建立这个螺旋的基础
build the foundation of that spiral,
那其他一切就更容易建起来
upon which everything else will be built.
这里有五个基本前提
So here are the five basic premises.
我会先简短地介绍一下 再逐个阐述
I'll go through them briefly now and elaborate on each
在接下来的几节课里 会分别对它们
in the next couple of lectures,interweaving them
进行学习 研究 和应用
with studies,research as well as applications.
正如我开始时提到的 这课程是关于搭建桥梁的
First,this course as I mentioned first is about bridge building:
搭建学科之间的桥梁 广集思源
bridge building among disciplines,eclectic,
并搭建学术界与社会之间的桥梁
and bridge building in terms of academia and Main street.
00:32:01,370 --&gt; 00:32:06,410
专业化常在学术界占主导地位
the specialization is very often dominant in academia.
本课程的做法
The approach of this course,
正好相反
with all its challenges,is the opposite.
如果我认为没有改变的可能
Once again I wouldn't be teaching this class,
就不会教这节课
if I didn't change is possible.
心理学的研究有很多
There is a lot of research in psychology,
很多证据显示 改变是非常困难的事
a lot of evidence that shows how difficult change is.
我认为改变是可能的
So I will argue that change is possible,
无论是个人变化
whether it's individual change,
还是组织变革
organizational change.
我们将探讨为什么是可能的
And we'll start to look at how it's possible.
这只是整个螺旋的最基本层次
Just the very basic level of the spiral.
我们本周只讨论"改变"
We have an entire week just devoted to change.
我们会详细讨论
We will elaborate on that:
技巧 方法 工具
techniques,methods,tools.
第三 这个前提与
Third,premise related to the first
决定幸福的内部因素有关
internal factors primarily determine happiness—
这是我要讨论的
this is what I'm going to argue for—
与决定幸福的
is opposed to happiness which is primarily function
外部环境无关
of external circumstances.
并不是说 外部环境不重要
Not saying that the external circumstances are not important,
我们同样应该注重改善外部环境
we should focus also on improving them,bettering them,
无论是我们自己 或对整个社会
whether for ourselves,for society at large.
然而 幸福主要
However,happiness primarily—
在于我们如何看待世界
not only,primarily—is dependent on how we perceive the world,
社会习俗规条 我们理性和感性上的认知
on the form,on our interpretation,on our perception.
"只能顺从人性"
Human nature must be obeyed
在各个方面
This,in many ways,
这酿成了历史上许多冲突
captures conflict that has gone throughout human history,
无论是政治上 还是宗教上
whether you look at politics,whether you look at religion,
无论是哲学 还是心理学
whether you look at philosophy as well as today,psychology.
我们如何看待人性?
How do we look at human nature?
是人性有缺陷 因此需要进一步完善吗?
Is human nature flawed and therefore needs to be perfected?
还是尽管我们不喜欢人性中的缺陷
Or is human nature flawed maybe something we don't like
也必须接受它?
but we need to accept it and work with it?
我会谈到后者
I'm going to argue for the latter of what I just said,
就是说我们必须顺从于人性
for the fact that human nature needs to be obeyed
接受它所有的缺陷和优点
with all its flaws,with all its shortcomings,
而不是试图从心理层面上
as opposed to attempting to perfect it
完善它
on the psychological level.
我们下节课再说这话题
We'll get to that next time.
颇具争议的是
Controversial,
精神健康和幸福的重要基础
the very important foundation of mental health and wellbeing.
最后
And finally,
我想说的是 幸福不应该只是
what I am going to argue for is that happiness isn't ought to be
我们追求的最终目标 还是一种道德追求
the ultimate end which we pursue and that is also a moral claim,
而不是一种普通的追求
as opposed to happiness just being another secondary pursuit
但也有些追求
and there are pursuits—
是更高级 更重要 更高尚的
there are higher,more important,more moral than that.
这一点也颇具争议
Once again,may sound controversial.
我也会涉及疾病
I'll try reconcile the disease,
和大家也许关心过的忧愁
the unhappiness that you may experience thinking about that.
同样 这留待下节课再讲
Again,more on that next time.
现在我们先从搭建"桥梁"说起
So let me begin with bridge building.
说回第一节课开始时
Here I am going back to what I talked about right
624
谈到的问题
at the very beginning of the first lecture.
也就是 搭起学校与社会之间的桥梁的想法
The idea of bridging Ivory tower and Main Street.
学术界内外 都有很多人
There are many people in academia,outside academia,
将世界一分为二
who divide the world essentially into two.
他们将外面的世界看成是现实
They talked about the real world that is outside,
是肮脏的 不洁 被亵渎的 而学术界
that is dirty,impure,profane versus academia,
则是崇高的 有理想的 神圣的
which is lofty,idealistic,sacred.
神圣与亵渎
Sacred versus the profane.
这种区分带来伤害
This distinction hurts.
它同时伤害了学术界及非学术界的人
It hurts academia and hurts people who are outside of academia.
哲学家Alfred North Whitehead
Alfred North Whitehead,the philosopher:
"大学小心翼翼地将我们
"The careful shielding of a university
与外界活动隔开
from the activities of the world around us
这样最容易打击学习兴趣 阻碍学习进步
is the best way to chill interest and to defeat progress.
大学不适合独身生活
Celibacy does not suit a university.
必须要与身边的人互动
It must mate itself with action."
640
这点对大学生活非常重要
This is very important for university.
他当时提到另一种心理学
talked about a second psychology.
他说另一种心理学就是
He said second psychology is a psychology
抛开实验室的研究
that leaves the labs that draws on the research done in the labs
实验室研究意义重大
that is important and meaningful,
但不只是注重这种研究
however,doesn't only focus on that.
而是走到外面的世界
It goes out to the outside world,
与外界互动 接触那些"肮脏"事物
interacts,gets its hand and mind dirty,
在外面工作 并吸取经验
does work outside and then applies its work
从"肮脏经验"中学习
and learns from "the dirty experiences"
将得到的经验带回实验室
and brings it back to the lab
诸如此类 就像一个上升的螺旋
and so on and so on in an upward spiral.
他称之为重要的另一种心理学
He called it the important second psychology,
这也是Alfred North Whitehead所提倡的
which is what Alfred North Whitehead is also talking about.
现在你们来到这里
Now you may be sitting here
且大多数人将来都不会进入学术界
and most of you aren't going to academia.
你可能会想
And you are thinking to yourself,
"好 学术界要结合实践做研究
"Ok,fine. So university,academia must make itself with action.
那与我有何关系?我们的联系在哪?"
What does it have to do with me? How is this relevant to me?"
它不仅与你有联系 它与你息息相关
Not only is it relevant to you,it has everything to do with you.
下面就是原因
And here's why.
世界最需要的
What the world needs,
不是其他什么 就是务实的理想主义者
more than anything else,is practical idealists.
我做过6年莱弗里特宿舍的住校导师
For 6 years,I was a resident tutor in Leverett House
我研究生在读时 就开始任教
when I was a graduate student and then I also started to teach.
在与学生的交谈中 让我印象最深的是
And what struck me most about conversations that I had,
无论是在莱弗里特宿舍或其他地方
either in Leverett or other houses,
学生们的使命感 你们的使命感
were students is their sense of mission,your sense of mission,
你们对成功的渴望
your desire to do good,
让世界变得更美好的愿望
to make the world a better place.
据我了解 很多学生毕业后
And as I followed many of the students after they graduate,
无论是与我一起工作
whether the students who work with me here as undergrads
还是我辅导的学生
or students who I tutored,
当我了解他们的前路 并不是些空话
when I followed the path,it wasn't just empty words.
这些学生勇往直前 做了非常棒的事
These students went ahead and did wonderful things,
无论是校外校内的
whether it was right out of college,
无论他们是否刚建立起自身
whether it was once they established themselves,
但可以确定的是 他们潜藏的思想
but there was always this,the back of their mind,
很多时候会涌现出来
very often fore of their minds,
"我怎样才能使这个世界变得更美好?"
"How can I make this world a better place?"
充满热情 理想化
Passionate. Idealistic.
美好 极其美好
Good-- in the deep sense,good.
渴望改变世界
This desire to make a difference
是所有学生都有的想法
come into just about all students.
很多人认为这一代人
There are many people who talk about this generation
以自我为中心
as the "ME" generation: all I care about,
这一代人只关心
all this generation cares about is
"赚更多的钱"
"well,let me just make more money",
"买大一点的房子"
"let me just get a bigger house",
"更成功 取得更高荣誉
"let me just be more successful and accrue more eclats,
变得更有威望"
more prestige".
这是一种错误的刻板印象
This is a false stereotype.
是的 荣誉 威望 金钱是重要的
Yes,eclats,prestige,money is important.
这对大多数人来说都很重要
It's important to most people in the world.
甚至是最重要的
A big deal.
但有这些刻板印象的人
But were these people who have these stereotypes—
他们只看到这些是最重要的吗?
were they (?) is that they see just that?
他们并不渴望改变世界
And they don't see the desire to make a difference.
每年哈佛有
1800 students at Harvard each year,
约1800名学生是
about 1800 students are members of
PBHA(菲利普斯布鲁克斯楼协会)的成员
PBHA (Phillips Brooks House Association).
不仅如此
That's not all.
还有一些没加入PBHA的学生甘当志愿者
There are other students who outside PBHA and who volunteer.
几乎所有人都是
Just about every single one of you.
看一下统计数据
At least if we look at the statistics,
你们每个人
just about every single one of you,
很快
very soon,
离开哈佛后 都将加入公司
after you leave Harvard,will join an organization,
无论它是否你的主要工作
whether--it could be your primary job or not—
这个组织是个社会企业
an organization that is a social enterprise,
非盈利机构 只为贡献社会而存在的
not for profit,something to better the world.
你会加入这样一个组织
You'll be on boards of such organizations.
你会捐钱给这些组织
You'll donate money to such organizations.
哈佛毕业生一向慷慨 无论是对时间
Harvard grads are generous with their time,
还是金钱和努力
with their money,with their efforts,
无论是商学院 法学院
whether the business school,the law school,
医学院 教育学院
college,Med school,Ed school—
你对社会贡献甚多 是因为你在乎
you give a lot,because you care.
无论是要贡献金钱还是时间 通常两者都要
Again whether it's money,whether it's time-- usually both.
都是成见
False stereotypes.
关于美国人也有些成见
There are also false stereotypes about Americans.
凭经验来说 美国人
Americans,empirically speaking—
或只是说哈佛学生
just empirically speaking about the Harvard students,
根据发展趋势和统计
looking the trends and statistics-- empirically speaking,
美国人是世界上最慷慨的人
Americans are the most generous people in the world.
不仅仅是因为他们更富有
Not just because they have more money to give,
的确 美国人更富有
yes,Americans have more money to give
他们常捐钱
and they give a lot more money,
无论是在扶贫或医疗救助方面
whether it's in food,whether it's in medical aid.
有研究证实 美国人也花最多时间
Americans also spend the most time-- this is a research done (?)—
比其他任何人所花的时间都多
Americans spend the most time out of any other people
平均每周有四个小时做志愿者的工作
in the world volunteering in average four hours a week,
做与自身工作无关的善事
volunteering outside their job which may also have
他们比世界上其他人更具社会目标
a social objective more than any other people in the world.
对于这个美好国家的成见
Once again,false stereotypes about this wonderful country.
这里很美好
And this is wonderful.
能来到这里是件美好的事
This is wonderful to see,wonderful to be here,
无论是在哈佛 还是在美国 真的很荣幸
whether it's Harvard,whether it's America-- a real privilege.
你们许多人
You see,many of you,
不久将会身居要职
not far from now,you will be in influential positions.
你们能够做善事吗
Will you be able to do a lot of good
在一个非营利机构里行善
in a for-profit organization,not for profit organization,
在你母校的董事会
on the board of your previous school,
贡献金钱和时间
with your money,with your time?
然而
However—
这是个原因
and here is the however—
我与许多研究生相处过
I've met many grad students with me
或当导师时的学生
or students when I was a tutor
学生曾跟我谈及他们的困扰
who express their frustration to me.
他们曾对我说 "你知道
They said to me,"You know,
我曾有世界上最良好的意愿
I had all the good intentions in the world.
我有最善良的心 想为世界作贡献
I have all the good intentions in the world. I want to do good.
我奉献出时间和金钱
I've donated my time,my money.
但还是觉得若有所失
But I feel that something is missing.
我觉得我能改变世界的能力
I feel that I've fallen short of my potential
越来越弱了"
to really make a difference."
为什么呢?因为美好的意愿和理想主义
Why? Because good will and idealism,
虽然必要 但却是不够的
while necessary,they are not sufficient.
远远不够
Not enough.
因为很多时候 即使有很好的意愿
Because very often,with very good intentions,
我们的能力还是有限
we may fall short of what we are capable of doing,
或在某些情况下 我们带来的伤害多于帮助
or in some situations,even hurt more than help.
有一些研究表明
And we'll look at some of these studies,
即使到了今天仍有
hopefully still today,
想做好事的人却好心干坏事
with very good intentions actually hurt more they helped.
数十年来的心理学家都有很好的意愿
Psychologists for decades had very good intentions
想帮助高危人群
about helping at risk population.
大量的金钱-数百万美元投资在研究上
A lot of money-- millions,millions of dollars went into that.
但收效甚微
With very little effect.
为什么呢?因为他们没有提出这样的问题
Why? Because they didn't ask the question
这特定情况下 他们应该问这个问题
that they needed to ask,which was,in that particular case,
这个健康本源的问题 为什么有些人
the salutogenic question: why do some individuals succeed
成长环境恶劣 依然能成功?
despite unfavorable circumstances?
即使不提出这个问题 他们也是心怀善意的
There were very good intentions before this question was asked.
充满理想主义
There was a lot of idealism.
这是不够的
It wasn't enough.
很多时候 这些干预会产生
Very often,some of these interventions engendered
消极的受害者心态
the passive victim mentality,
而不是积极作用者心态
as opposed to the active agent mentality
这是Marva Collins提出的观点
that Marva Collins instilled,
是根据Karen Reivich和Martin Seligman的研究所提的
the programs by Karen Reivich and Martin Seligman instill.
这正是心理学起作用的地方
And this is where psychology can help.
因为我们可以展开研究
Because we can take the research and apply it.
并应用到现实中
We can take the research and apply it,
又回到了那个问题 为什么
which goes back to the point why it is so important
搭起学校与社会的桥梁如此重要
to bridge Ivory tower and Main Street.
大多数这类研究并没运用于现实
Most of these research is not applied.
例如
So for example:
有多少教师在课室努力工作
how many teachers working in the classroom
日复一日地研究皮格马利翁效应?
day in and day out know about the Pygmalion effect?
我们下周或再下周会探讨
The Pygmalion effect that we are going to talk about
皮格马利翁效应
next week or the week after,
说明为什么教师的期望就是自我实现的预言
shows how teachers' expectations are self-fulfilling prophecies.
如果我们有很高的期望
And if we have high expectations,
如果我们在学生身上看到伟大的潜能
if we see the seed of greatness in the students,
那么这种潜能就更可能被激发
that seed of greatness is more likely to flourish.
或者 如果我们看不到这潜能
Or if we don't appreciate it,
它就会像刚萌芽的幼苗一样被扼杀
it will depreciate—wither and die.
有多少教师了解这些研究?
How many teachers know about these studies?
他们怎样通过自己的信念
And how they create through their beliefs
创造出自我实现的预言 来影响学生?
the self-fulfilling prophecy when it comes to their students?
有多少教师了解Marva Collins?
How many teachers know about Marva Collins?
每个教师在第一次接受教师培训时
Every teacher in the world on the first day of teacher training
需要了解Marva Collins和皮格马利翁效应
need to learn about Marva Collins and Pygmalion effect.
但事实并非如此
They don't do that.
接下来谈
How about this?
自我尊重
Self-esteem.
你如何提升自尊?
How do you increase self-esteem?
如果我在这里做一项民意调查 保证大多数人
If I have to do a poll here,most people,
会说通过赞美来提升
guaranteed,would say praise people.
赞美别人 赞美孩子
Praise people. Praise children.
这将增强他们的自尊
It will enhance their self-esteem.
说对了一部分
Right. Partially right.
如果把这当作全部的真理
And if it's taken as the whole truth,
则是有害的
and nothing but the truth,it's detrimental.
因为有很多研究显示
Because there is a lot of research that shows
当我们不加区别地赞扬别人
when we praise people indiscriminately,
我们实际上是在长期地
we are actually in the long run
默默地伤害他们 而非帮助他们
potentially hurting them more than helping them,
无论是对他们的幸福感 还是成功
whether it's their wellbeing,as well as their success.
但关于提升自尊有个常见的说法
But the self-esteem movement mostly says
要经常赞美别人和孩子
praise people,praise children all the time.
这点很重要
And again,that's important.
同样重要的是 要懂得如何赞美
But it's also important to know how to praise.
有多少人了解
How many people are familiar with the work
斯坦福大学心理学家Carol Dweck的作品
of the Stanford psychologist,Carol Dweck.
你们在这几周内会了解到
Well,you are going to be familiar with it in a few weeks.
很多好心的理想主义者都不了解这些
Many idealists with good intentions are not.
他们依然认为
And they continue to support or to practice
提升自尊就要不加区别地赞扬
self-esteem as indiscriminate praise,
这最终造成的伤害大于帮助
ultimately hurting more than helping.
有多少心理学家或干涉主义者
How many psychologists,or rather how many interventionists
怀有好的意愿 同时又了解
with good intentions are familiar
Albert Bandura关于自我效能感论的研究?
with the work of Albert Bandura on self-efficacy?
要怎样培养?
And how you cultivate that?
还不够
Not enough.
很多时候结果都是弊大于利
And very often,more harm than good is created.
有多少心理学家了解
How many psychologists are familiar
这个心理和生理的新领域?
with this new emerging field of the mind and the body?
有多少人知道下面这个让人欣慰的案例
How many know about the studies that cheerful
瑜伽练习
example that yoga practice diminishes significantly,
比任何试过的干预措施都有效
more than any other interventions that they tried,
犯人在监狱里练瑜伽
the likelihood of second-time offenders
会降低他们的二次犯罪率
when they practice it in jail?
在狱中练过瑜伽的犯人
After their release,they are much less likely to return to jail
获释后较少会再进监狱
if they do some yoga there.
虽奇怪 但却是事实
Strange,but true.
有多少人知道-
How many people know that—
这点与我提出的第一个观点有关-
and this is connected to my first point—
多少人知道 冥想能转换我们的大脑思维
that doing meditation actually literally transforms our brain,
使我们更容易感染到积极情绪
making us more susceptible to positive emotions
在面对痛苦时更坚强
and more resilient in the face of painful emotions.
多少人知道 每周三次
How many people know that three times a week
体育锻炼 每次三十分钟 与最强劲的精神药物
physical exercise,30 minutes each time has the same effect
有同样的效果?
as our most powerful psychiatric drugs?
每周三次 每次30分钟
Three times a week for 30 minutes.
多少心理学家或精神科医生规定病人
How many psychologists or psychiatrists prescribe
"每周跑步锻炼三次 早上来见我"?
"run three times a week and see me in the morning"?
还不够
Not enough.
这是实际与理想主义相结合
That's practical idealism coupled together.
在解决冲突时
How are in conflict resolution,
大多数人
the dominant theme of most people
好心想要解决冲突
with good intentions want to resolve conflict
让人们坐下来
is let's get the people together,
好好谈谈
let's get them to talk,
然后就能过上幸福快乐的日子
and they and we will live happily ever after.
我们有1954年的研究
Well we have research from 1954—
那些想从社会心理方面解决冲突的人 Muzafer Sherif
those of you who take social psych—Muzafer sherif,
显示接触假说
showing that the contact hypothesis
也就是让人们彼此交谈的方法
which is just get people to talk to one another,
并不起作用
doesn't work;
很多时候反而让情况更糟
in fact very often it worsens the situation—
很多时候会使冲突进一步恶化
very often the conflict actually gets worse
因为人们只是聚在一起进行商谈
as a result of just getting together and talking,
接触还不够
that the contact is not enough,
你需要的是
that what you need,
引用Muzafer警长的话
in the words of Muzafer sherif
后来由Elliot Aronson详细阐述-
and later elaborated on by Elliot Aronson—
你需要的是一个非常明确的目标
what you need is a superordinate goal—
一个得集体实现的目标
a goal that you have carry out together,
你自己一人做不来的
that you cannot do by yourself—
由一个内部有冲突的小组来实现
carry out together with a conflicting group.
这样随着时间的推移 就能解决冲突
And that's how over time you resolve conflicts,
不仅是让人们聚在一起而已
not just bring people together.
可以想到 这离我们的意愿不远了
Now as you can imagine,this is very close to home for me.
因为在阿拉伯 以色列冲突中
Because there were many people on both sides
双方都有很多人想结束战争
of the Arab/Israeli conflict who wanted to end it,
美国也有很多人想结束它
many people in this country who wanted to end it.
他们做了什么呢?
So what did they do?
我们把他们关到一个房间里吧
Let's just get them together. Let's get them in a room,
无论是在戴维营 奥斯陆或埃及
whether it was in Camp David,whether it was in Oslo or in Egypt.
让他们交谈 解决他们的冲突
Let's just get them together to talk,to resolve their conflict
和他们的问题 然后我们就能过上幸福生活
and their issue and then we will all live happily ever after.
那样会发生什么事呢?
What happened?
局势会恶化
The situation worsened.
现在我们都知道这个道理了
Now we've known that.
Muzafer警长在1954年就证明了
Muzafer sherif showed that in 
接触假设 只让人们一起交谈
that it is the most likelihood outcome
最可能的结果是引起更多冲突
of just contact hypothesis,just getting them to be together.
有很多人都试图解决冲突
And there were many people trying to resolve the conflict,
不只在中东 世界各地都有这种情况
not just in the Middle East,else in the world,
人们都心存好意
with very good intentions
但往往在不经意间使事情变得更糟
but very often making inadvertently the matters worse.
理想主义和善意是不够的
Idealism and good intentions are not enough.
我们需要将理论结合实践
We need to merge,to mate the research with the practice.
需要你们这样做
And this is where you come in,
认真对待
taking it seriously.
但当我认真对待这事
Now when I take it seriously,
就出现了一个问题
there is a problem here
有时研究所得并不一定是好消息
because sometimes research doesn't deliver good news.
如果仅仅是将
It would be much easier and nicer
以色列人和阿拉伯人聚在一起 冲突就结束
if we could just simply get
那事情就简单得多 容易得多
Israelis and Arabs together and the conflict would end.
这将让事情变得更简单
It would be much nicer and easier,smoother,
非常容易
it would be much easier,
如果我们要培养孩子自尊
if we could just cultivate children self-esteem
仅仅通过多一些赞美
by giving them positive feedback—
告诉他们 他们有多棒
telling them how wonderful they are.
这很容易做到 不是吗?
It's easy to do,right?
这样感觉很好 他们感觉良好 我们也是
It feels good. They feel good. We feel good.
但从长远来看 仅仅这样做并没有帮助
But in the long run,it doesn't help,if it's only that.
只是容易而已
Much easier.
研究往往带来坏消息
And research very often delivers bad news,
只是接触还不够
saying it's not enough-- the contact;
只是赞扬还不够
it's not enough to praise.
然后人们下意识地选择
And then people choose subconsciously,
不自觉地忽视研究所得的坏结果
not consciously to ignore the research and go with her heart.
虽然跟随自己的感觉是重要
And that's important to go with your heart.
但更重要的是同时注重感觉和思维
But it's important to with the heart and the mind.
试想一下 如果一个航空工程师
Imagine if an aeronautics engineer
在早上醒来 说:
woke up in the morning and said,
"万有引力
"you know,the Law of Gravity thing
真的带给我很多麻烦
really makes things difficult for me.
很麻烦
It's a pain.
如果没有万有引力 事情就易办多了
Things would be so much easier without the law of gravity.
航空设备也不用这么麻烦"
The design would be simpler."
然后他决定不考虑万有引力设计飞机
And he designs airplane and he ignores the law of gravity.
他会设计出怎样一架飞机呢?
What kind of airplane machine would he or she design?
肯定会失败
A failure.
航空工程师必定要考虑到现实
Aeronautics engineer takes into consideration of reality.
现实就是万有引力的存在
And reality-- there's Law of Gravity.
我们得接受现实
We deal with that.
同样 研究显示的结果就是现实
Similarly,what research shows us is reality:
有哪些现象 哪些可行 哪些不可行
what's out there,what's working and what's not working.
我们需要遵循现实
And we need to conform to it.
考虑现实
Take it into consideration.
能否搭起学校与社会的桥梁
And it's up to you,to take responsibility,
取决于我们自己
to bridge the Ivory tower and Main Street.
在哈佛你们会有32种专业
You are being exposed in 32 classes fraught your Harvard career
各自的课程有不同的主题
to the most rigorous thinking on different topics
你要将这些知识一一吸收并应用
have you take it and apply it,
无论是心理学还是经济学
whether it's psychology,whether it's in economics,
当然如果是工程学或计算机科学
obviously in engineering or computer science,
就会比社会科学和人文科学
where it's done much more readily
更容易理解
than in social sciences and humanities.
重点是 你要为自己负责
It's important to take responsibilities,
因为没人会来帮你
because no one else is going to do it for you.
没人会帮你
No one is coming.
第二前提
Premise 2:
作为一个实际的理想主义者
To be a practical idealist,
它的基础必须是
the foundation of it has to be
相信改变是可能的
the belief that change is possible.
因为如果从个人层面或社会层面来说
Because if the change was not possible on the individual level,
改变都是不可能的 那我在这里干什么?
on the society level,why am I doing what I am doing?
为什么我要花时间在这里?
Why would I spend time?
倒不如做个享乐主义者
Let me just be a hedonist,
尽情享受生活
trying to enjoy my life as much as possible.
你们可能会说
Now for many of you,when you look at this you may say,
"好吧 改变是有可能的
"Well,Ok,yes,change is possible.
我相信这一点 但为什么我们需要把它
I believe that and why do we need to have it
作为课程的基本前提
as a basic premise of the course,
而不说'改变是虚幻的'?"
as opposed to change is illusive?"
在心理学上
Well,in the context of a psychology course,
改变是有可能的 这点十分重要
it's anything but trivial that change is possible.
下面我用一项研究来说明
Let me share with you one study to illustrate what I mean.
明尼苏达州的双胞胎研究
The Minnesota Twin study,
一个在心理学领域非常有名的研究
one of the most famous studies in the field of psychology,
是两个杰出的心理学家Lykken和Tellegen做的
was done by Lykken and Tellegen,two prominent psychologists.
这个研究是关于
And what they did was they wanted to understand
基因的重要性
how much do genes matter.
与教育相比 它对性格的影响多大?
How much is it about nature versus nurture?
要如何测试呢?
So how do you test that?
同卵双胞胎
You look at identical twins,
他们拥有相同的基因谱
monozygotic twins who share the same genetic profile.
研究那些被分开抚养长大的同卵双胞胎
And you look at those who are reared apart.
因为如果他们由相同的父母抚养 人们会说
Because if they are reared by the same parents,one could argue,
"他们这么相似 是因为有同样的成长环境
"Well they came out very similar because same environment:
他们外表一模一样 上一样的学校
they look the same; they go to the same schools;
有同样的父母 等等"
same parents,and so on."
如果你能找到 出生时就分开了的
But what if you are able to find identical twins
同卵双胞胎
who were separated at birth,
在完全不同的环境里长大
and reared in radically different environments.
现实中能找到这种人
Well you could.
学者发现有很多这样的人
And they found significant number of those,
有时甚至在不同的洲长大
reared in,sometimes different continents.
他们对这些双胞胎进行了研究
And they studied them.
发现了一个明显的现象
And what they found remarkably
这些双胞胎极其相似
was significant similarities among these twins,
有时相似之处非常惊人
sometimes to the points of unbelievable.
像有一组双胞胎
Like one set of twins—
他们娶了名字相同的妻子
I think they found the wives with the same name.
他们在不同的国家长大
They were reared in different countries,
直到37岁才知道对方的存在
didn't know about each other until the age of 37—
娶了相似的妻子 喝同一种啤酒
married similar wives,enjoyed drinking the same beer,
为自己的孩子取相同的名字
called their children by the same names.
有些相似之处令人难以置信
There were some mind-boggling similarities.
有例外
And this is an exception,
但也只有很少例外
but there were quite a few of those exceptions.
让心理学家更感兴趣的是
But more interesting for psychologists
他们的个性非常相似
was that their personality was incredibly similar.
让积极心理学学者 和研究幸福和快乐的人
And very interesting for positive psychologists,
更感兴趣的是
those concerned with wellbeing and happiness:
这些双胞胎的幸福和快乐水平非常相似
their wellbeing and happiness levels were incredibly similar.
即使他们在完全不同的环境中长大
Even if they were raised in radically different environments.
Lykken和Tellegen发表了一篇文章
Lykken and Tellegen published a paper,
一篇在80年代非常有影响力的论文
a very influential paper in the 80s,
论文题为"幸福是一种随机现象"
which they called "Happiness is a Stochastic Phenomenon".
论文用以下这句话作结尾
And they end this paper with the following quote:
"想变得更快乐
"It may be that trying to be happier
和想变高一样徒劳
is as futile as trying to be taller
只会适得其反"
and is therefore counterproductive."
这句话有两方面让我觉得不快
This quote made me very unhappy on two accounts.
这是句非常有影响力的名言
This wa s a very influential quote.
曾被登上《纽约时报》
This appeared in New York Times.
他们也在电视上说过这话
They talked about on television.
受访时也说过
They were interviewed.
这就有问题了
Very problematic.
那我们在这里做什么?
Coz what are we doing here?
如果这是那次研究的结果
If this is the outcome of the research,
一项严谨的研究
a rigorous research that they did—
而不是马马虎虎的轻松的研究
not an easy research to go and look around the world,
我们能做些什么呢?
what can we do about it?
我认为
Here is my response to that:
简单来说 改变是可能的
Very simply,change is possible.
别盲目相信我的话
And again,don't take my word for it of course.
下面我来详细阐述这话
Let me discuss that further-- elaborate.
有证据显示
There is account of evidence
人们的确是会改变的
where people actually do change
我们有研究显示 经常接受治疗的人
and we have research showing that people going to therapy
会容易改变
very often change as the a result of therapy.
斯坦福大学的心理学家Albert Bandura的研究
Work by Albert Bandura,Stanford psychologist
表明 人们常因遇到一个特别的句子
shows that very often people encountering one special sentence,
读到或听到它
reading it or hearing it from something,
这句话就会改变他们的生活
that sentence can change their lives,
在书上读到 或是有某种经历-
reading it on certain book,having certain experiences—
积极的或痛苦的经历-
positive or painful experiences –
有这样一个概念叫做 创伤后应激障碍(PTSD)
there is this concept of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).
还有一种概念叫做 创伤后成长
There is also a concept of Post-Traumatic Growth.
人们的快乐水平会上下变化
So people change-- up or down in their level of happiness
这是他们的经验之谈
is a result of their experiences.
有可靠证据显示 并非每一个人的
So there is counter evidentce that shows that not everyone,
幸福水平都取决于基因
level of wellbeing is determined by their genes.
事实上 有研究
In fact,there is research
显示基因很重要 影响甚多
that shows yes genes do matter and they matter a lot,
探讨改变的时候我们再谈这问题
as we'll talk about during the week on change.
还有其他因素和基因一样重要
Other things matter as well.
像Lykken和Tellegen那样 人们常错误地
And the error that Lykken and Tellegen and many others make
概括出一个结论 "变化是不可能的"
when they generalize and say "change is not possible"
00:59:59,050 --&gt; 01:00:00,
我称之为"大众错误"
is what I call "the error of the average".
平均而言
Yes,on average,
当研究这40或50组被分开抚养的双胞胎
when you look at this group of 40 or 50 twins reared apart,
大体看来
when you look at the average,
他们是一样的
they are just about the same.
然而 没有单独来看
However,that's not looking at the individuals
因为 虽然他们大多数是非常相似的
because while many of them are the same,
但并不是全部都一样
not all are the same.
这让我想起一个统计学笑话
It reminds me of a joke about the statistician
在一个平均水深为10英寸的游泳池里 谁会被淹死
who drowned in a pool with an average height of 10 inches.
只知道平均值
You see you cannot tell the height or the depth rather
并不知道游泳池的水深
of a pool based on the average.
由于该池平均10英寸深
Because that pool may be average of 10 inches,
或许它某些区域有20英尺深
but maybe it has places that are 20 feet deep,
如果它是一个大水池的话
if it's a large pool.
同样 当你平均地看这些双胞胎
The same when you look at the average of individuals and twins.
大体来说 他们都极其相似
The majority on average,they are extremely similar.
但也有少数的异常值
But there are also outliers.
很多时候 这个异常值
And very often,it's the outliers,
这些差异最有趣
the differences that are the most interesting.
因为他们
Because they stretch—
不只延伸了我们的想象 还让我们能理解
not just our imagination-- they stretch our ability to understand
怎样的时间和地点 有可能产生变化
when and where change is possible.
当我们看到了例外-
The question when we see exceptions,
无论是在Lykken和Tellegen的研究
whether it's the Lykken and Tellegen study,
还是别的出现了例外的研究-
where we do see exceptions—
当发现不是所有的双胞胎都一样
not all twins were the same,
主要的问题
majority were,but not all—
已不再是 改变是否有可能
the question is no longer whether or not change is possible,
而是怎样实现这种改变
but rather how is change possible.
例外证实了那个规律
Once again,the exception proves the rule.
认为"改变是不可能"的
And the research that argues
研究是有害的
that it's not possible to change,is detrimental.
设想一个8岁的女孩
Think about an eight year old girl,
她很忧伤
who's very unhappy,
然后在杂志上读到那个研究
and then reads some magazine about that study,
研究告诉她 基本上你的基因决定了一切
saying that basically you are genetically set point
你与生俱来的一切 将伴随你终生
what you are born with is there for life.
她会更忧伤
She's unhappy.
她只有8岁 但会觉得非常焦虑与痛苦
She feels anxious and miserable as an 8 year old.
她就会想
And she says to herself,
"我的人生就是这样 我生来不幸"
"That's it. That's my lot in life. I was born unlucky."
那很可能会成为一个自我实现的预言
And that,very often,becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
她始终不快乐
And she remains unhappy.
有时这研究让她比以前更不快乐
Sometimes it even makes her less happy than she was before.
因为现在她简直是绝望了
Because now she's also helpless.
改变是可能的
Change is possible.
你知道我经常说
You know I often say that
我是教积极心理学的最佳人选
I am the right the person to teach positive psychology.
为什么?
Why?
因为我不是生来就有"快乐基因"
Because I wasn't born with "happy genes".
从遗传学上讲 我天生就
I was born with,genetically speaking,
比较容易焦虑
relatively high level of anxiety,
容易得抑郁症
inclination toward rumination,
这是经过测试证实的
over-examination—
在后面的课程上我们会谈到
we'll talk about that later in the course.
我之所以研究积极心理学
I went into the positive psychology,
探索心理学领域
into the field of psychology,
正如我第一节课时提到的
as I mentioned in the first lecture,
是因为我不快乐
because I was unhappy here.
随着时间的推移 出现了很多这类研究
And over time,as a result of many of these studies,
由于提出了正确的问题
result of examination result of asking also the right questions,
我变得更快乐
I have become happier.
个人层面上 是有可能变得更快乐
So on a personal level,I know it's possible to become happier.
现在的我比15年前的我更快乐
Now I am happier today than I was fifteen years ago
我希望15年后的我
when I started. I hope to be happier 15 years
比今天的我更快乐
from today than I am today.
这是个终身的过程
It's a life-long process.
但这是有可能的 很多人证实了这是有可能的
But it is possible. And many people show that it's possible.
而那些认为这不可能的人
And those who argue it's not possible
他们用科学来争论
and use science to argue for that,
很多时候 只有阻碍作用而毫无帮助
very often,are hurting more than helping the field.
最近Lykken和Tellegen
Now by the way Lykken and Tellegen were interviewed
受到《时代》杂志的采访 谈"快乐"问题
recently in TIME magazine issue of happiness.
下面是他们说的几句话
Let me quote to you what they said.
2005年 Lykken说
This is in 2005-- Lykken:
"我作了一个愚蠢的声明
"I made a dumb statement.
显然 我们能改变快乐水平 变得更高或更低"
It is clear that we can change happiness levels,up or down."
于是他们背弃了原来的声明
So they went back on their statement.
这个声明轰动一时
It was a sensational statement at the time.
改变当然是可能的
It certainly is possible.
我们怎样做更负责任的研究
So how do we do research that's more responsible,
怎样杜绝研究产生坏影响?
that does not lead to detrimental results?
同时 研究必须是真实的
And at the same time,true.
我们并不是要"发明"研究
We don't want to invent research.
研究的目的在于查明事实
Research is about identifying things
现实中真正发生了的事实
that really occur/happen in reality.
首先 我认为在健康研究方面
So one of the first things that I'll argue for in terms of
主要的问题是"让我们注重可行的方法"
healthy research is "let's also focus on what is working".
这是我们过去探讨过的问题
That's first thing that we discussed in the past lecture.
第二 我认为
The second thing that I will argue for
除了要研究可行的方法 还要研究最优秀的个体
in addition to studying what works is also to study the best.
为什么说"最优秀的个体"呢?
What do I mean by best?
我们不但要研究人们因何快乐
Let's not just study what makes people happy.
不要只是研究快乐的人
Let's not just study happy people.
不要只是研究快乐良好的爱情
Let's not just study happy relationships and good relationships.
让我们研究的最快乐的人
Let's study the happiest people.
让我们研究最成功的爱情
Let's study the most successful relationships
从中学习借鉴
and learn from that.
这是个与大众研究
That is a radically different approach
完全不同的研究方法
than studying just the average.
我想说的是 不要研究大众
Because what I am saying here is "let's not study the average",
研究快乐指数最高的5%的人
let's study the top five percent
这样就可以更好地理解这一现象
so that we can understand the phenomenon better.
这就是Abraham Maslow
The person who talks about this is Abraham Maslow.
提出的"成长尖端统计学"
When he talked about "growing-tip" statistics.
以下这话引自他的书
Let me read to you-- this is taken from his book:
"设计出这类调研是为了
"What this kind of research design means
改变我们对统计的观念
is a change in our conception of statistics,
尤其是对抽样调查的看法
and especially of sampling theory.
我非常支持
What I am frankly espousing here
'成长尖端统计学'
is what I have been calling "growing-tip statistics,"
我的头衔来自以下的研究发现
taking my title from the fact
最优秀的遗传基因会在
that it is at the growing tip of a plant
幼苗的成长尖端出现"
that the greatest genetic action takes place."
他的意思是
What he's saying is that
"让我们学习圣人
"let's study the sages,the saints,
非凡的人"
the extraordinary people,the arrowhead"
这样能帮助我们了解
so that we can understand and realize
人类的潜能
the potential in all people.
我再引述他另一句更长的话
Let me quote him in greater length.
这话非常重要 是我作这个研究的原因
This is very important,which is why I am doing it:
"如果想知道人类最快能跑多快
"If we want to know how fast a human being can run,
那从好的样本中测出平均数是
then it is no use to average out the speed of a "good sample"
没用的
of the population;
而应该收集田径类奥运冠军的信息
it is far better to collect Olympic gold medal winners
看他们能跑多快
and see how well they can do.
如果想知道心灵成长的可能性
If we want to know the possibilities for spiritual growth,
人类价值增长或道德发展的可能性
value growth or moral development in human being,
那我认为 我们可以研究
then I maintain that we can learn most
最道德或圣洁的人
by studying our most moral,ethical,or saintly people.
整体来说 我认为人类历史
On the whole I think it fair to say that human history
是人性逐渐缺失的过程的
is a record of the ways in which human nuture
一个记录
has been sold short.
人性的潜在极限
The highest possibilities of human nature
实际上一直被低估了
have practically always been underrated.
显然 我们平常称之为'正常'的东西
Certainly it seems more and more clear that what we call "normal"
在心理学上 实际是种大众精神病理
in psychology is really a psychopathology of the average,
看上去平平无奇却又非常广泛
so undramatic and so widely spread
我们甚至没有注意到它"
that we don't even notice it ordinarily."
你们明白
You see,
他话里的含义吗?
the implications of what he's saying here?
01:07:33,360 --&gt; 01:07:34,770
基本上 他的意思是
Essentially what he's saying is
"不要只研究为什么大多数人失败
"let's not just study why do most individuals fail;
让我们也研究为什么有些人
let's also study why do some-- not many—
1203
但为什么有的人尽管条件恶劣也能成功"
but why do some individuals succeed despite the circumstances".
不要只研究整体
Let's not study just the average
整体看来的话 人是不能改变的
that says that people can't really change.
让我们来研究改变了的人
Let's study those people who have changed,
真的改变了自身生活
who have literally transformed their lives
和身边其他人生活的人
and those lives around them.
这是个激进的研究方法
This is a radical approach to research.
对研究我们自身来说
This is a radical approach to the search,
这也是个激进的方法
to studying ourselves as well.
因为很多时候 如果我们只研究平均水平
Because very often,if we only study the average,
那就只会看到平均的结果 只看到几何形状
we only see the average,we only see the geometric shapes
完全忽略了汽车上的孩子
and completely missed the children on the bus.
很多时候
And very often,
最紧迫的问题的答案
the answer to some of our most pressing questions
出人意料
lies in the extraordinary—
就在汽车的孩子身上
lies on the children on the bus.
除了我还有其他人
Now does anyone other than me—
我承认我属于这一类
because I admit that I fall into this category—
但有谁在听到我说的这些话时
but anyone other than me feel a little bit disease
感到不舒服吗?
when I talk about this?
说真的 当我谈到
Seriously,a little bit disease when I talk about
"让我们集中精力研究最优秀的个体 圣人 非凡的人"
"let's focus on studying the best—
有人感到不舒服吗?
the saint,the sages,the extraordinary"?
我觉得不大舒服
I feel disease.
你们有些人应该也有这感觉
I'm sure some of you feel that too.
因为这难道不是精英主义吗?
Because after all,isn't that elitist?
我们不是应该研究普罗大众吗?
Shouldn't we study the average
因为我们关心的不只是精英
because we concern not just with elites?
我们关心的是普罗大众
We are concerned with the average.
以下的问题有两个原因
So there are two answers to that—
我为什么还要继续说?我必须承认
why I still maintain,and I must admit
每次教到或想到这个统计
I still feel some disease every time I teach this,
我就觉得有点不舒服
every time I think about this and I think too,
01:09:32,470 --&gt; 01:09:34,440
研究最优秀的个体 为什么如此重要
why it is so important to study the best,
为什么成长尖端统计学
why the "growing-tip" statistics is
如此重要 我要建议
such an important approach to research that I encourage
大家使用
my students to carry out.
首先
First of all,
因为它不是排除了普罗大众
because it is not to the exclusion of the average.
就像积极心理学不是说 排除不可行的事
Just like positive psychology does not say "let's exclude
排除病理研究"
what's not working; let's exclude study of pathology".
同样 成长尖端统计学不是提倡
Similarly,"growing-tip" statistics is not saying
"我们别研究大众了"
"let's not study the average".
它提倡也去研究最优秀的个体
It says "let's also study the best".
因此在这问题上无须计较研究对象是不是精英
So this is the first thing to alleviate the concern of elitism.
第二点 更为重要的是
The second issue,the second response is even more important.
研究最优秀的个体 能让每个人从中受益
Because everyone benefits,when we study the best.
而所谓的"大众"
And the "average"-- whatever that means,
在这种研究中
the "average" benefits even more
"大众"比"精英"受益更多
than the best of this kind of studies.
为什么呢?
Why?
例如 对适应力的研究
For example: the study of resilience.
我们本可以继续研究几百年来的
We could have gone on and studied the average at-risk population
平均受危人群
for decades and centuries.
应该会取得一点点进展
And very little advances would have been made.
事实证明进展甚微
Very little advances were made.
只有当我们开始研究
It was only when we started to study
这些"最优秀"的个体 成功的孩子
those "best" examples,those successful kids,
那些"超级"孩子
those "super" kids as they were initially named.
只有当我们开始研究这些
It was only when we started to study those
才能了解如何帮助到整体
that we actually understood how we can best help that population.
只要将心理韧性研究应用到生活中
And once we applied our studies-- the resilience issue,
每个人受益良多
everyone benefited and continued to benefit from it.
这就是个成长尖端统计学的研究实例
That's an example of "growing-tip" statistics research.
那关于冥想的研究呢?
Or how about the study of meditation?
我想研究冥想
So I want to study how to meditate.
是不是可以在哈佛大二学生里随机抽样
Do I go out to Harvard yard and take a random sample
来研究冥想?
of sophomores to study meditation?
还是去西藏的山顶
Or do I go to a mountain top in Tibet
研究冥想了几十年的人?
and study the people who have been doing it for decades?
当然我该去研究他们
Of course I go and study them!
的确有心理学家这样做过
This is exactly what psychologists did!
他们研究了冥想者的大脑
And they studied their brain—
谈到冥想时再谈这问题
we'll talk about it when we talk about meditation—
通过研究说明他们的大脑
and they illustrated how their brain
如何通过冥想来转换
is transformed through meditation.
像心理学家on Kabat Zinn
Psychologists,like Jon Kabat Zinn,
Richard Davidson和Herbert Benson
Richard Davidson and Herbert Benson,
能从这些最优秀的个体中吸取经验
were able to take what they learned from these extraordinary,
并应用到普通人的生活中
best individuals and apply it to other people's lives
如果我每天冥想15或20分钟
so that now I benefit from meditation
就能从中受益
when I do it for 15 minutes or 20 minutes a day.
千千万万的"普罗大众"
And millions of other people,"the average",
因对最优秀的个体的研究
benefit a great deal because of the study of the best,
而受惠
of the "growing-tip".
那爱情呢?
How about relationships?
你能想象
Can you imagine
对整个人类历史上的恋爱关系进行研究
a study of relationships throughout human history
并求平均值吗?
that focuses on the average?
人类史上的普通恋爱关系是指什么?
What's the average relationship in human history?
人类史上的普通恋爱关系
The average relationship in human history
其一是女人是被压制的一方
is one in which the woman is subjugated.
这就是人类史上的普通恋爱关系
That's the average relationship in human history.
如果我们只研究这种恋爱关系呢?
Now what if we just study that?
是否有帮助?
Would that be helpful?
不 John Stuart Mill这样的人
No,it was when people like John Stuart Mill,
研究了他自身的恋爱关系
who studied his relationships
这在当时是极不寻常的
which was at the time extraordinary,
研究过后他发现恋爱关系能改变
realized the potential of what all relationships can be
他这本书是以女性主导地位为题的
that he wrote his book on subjugation of women,
这本书是19世纪最重要的书之一
one of the most important books
是女权运动和平等运动的
of the 19th century that has led to the feminist movement
导火线
and to the equality movement.
01:13:23,870 --&gt; 01:13:25,370
如果他只研究普通的恋爱关系呢?
What if he only studies the average?
那样对人际关系有帮助吗?
Would that help relationships?
完全没有
Not at all.
那教学呢?
How about teaching?
要了解如何教学 你想怎样做?
What do you want to do in order to learn about teaching—
研究平均水平的教师还是研究Marva Collins
go and study the average teachers or go and study Marva Collins
然后将Marva Collins的经验应用到所有老师身上?
and then apply what Marva Collins does to all teachers?
当着眼于研究最优秀的人体时 每个人都得益
Everyone benefits when we focus on the tip of stamen—
这就是为什么Maslow说人性
this is why Maslow said human nature
和人的潜能会被削弱
and human potential has been sold short,
如果我们只研究平均水平的话
when we only study the average.
同样涉及到研究我们个人的最大长处
It's also about studying our personal best,
而不仅是研究其他人的最大长处
not just other people's best,
无论是不是我们的最佳经验
whether it's our personal best experiences because
因为研究我们的最开心
if we study our best experiences when we are at our happiest,
最成功
when we are at our most successful,
恋爱关系最佳时的状态
when we thrive the most within the relationship,
那我们也可以从中学习并应用到将来
we can learn from it and apply it to our future as well.
当我们研究平均水平 我们只是描述日常生活
When we study our average,we are describing our lives.
研究我们当中最优秀的个体时
When we are studying the best within ourselves,
我们潜意识里在学习
we are potentially prescribing.
Maslow又说:"虽然他们人数少
Maslow again: "Few in number though they be,
但我们可以学到很多有用的东西
we can learn a great deal about values
从对这些最优秀
from the direct study of these highly evolved,
最成熟的 心理最健康的个体的研究当中
most mature,psychologically healthiest individuals,
和对大众的峰值的研究当中可以知道
and from the study of the peak moments of average individuals,
他们达到了短暂的自我实现"
moments,in which they become transiently self-actualized."
如果我们自己吸取这些经验
If we learn from these experiences in ourselves,
那么问题就不再是 是否有可能
the question is no longer whether or not it's possible
越来越多地体验它
to experience it more and more in our lives.
而是"怎样去体验它"
The question is "how is it possible to experience it".
好
Alright.
我们讨论过改变自己
So we talked about changing ourselves,
为什么成长尖端统计学
how it's possible the "growing-tip" statistics
会是积极心理学研究中的
which is the second significant idea
第二个重要理念
within research in positive psychology:
第一个重要理念是"研究可行的事"
first significant idea is "let's study what works"
第二个重要理念是"研究最优秀的个体"
the second significant idea is "let's study what works best".
但这是关乎个体的改变
But this is about individual change.
那社会变革呢?
How about societal change?
最后我想介绍以下这项研究
I want to share with you at the end today a study,
心理学最有名的研究
one of the most famous studies in the field
"剑桥-萨默维尔青年学习心理学"
called "the Cambridge-Somerville Youth Study psychology".
这项研究从上世纪30年代开始
This was the study that was run,
由哈佛大学与麻省理工学院共同进行
starting in the 1930s right here between Harvard and MIT,
这些人拥有最高的思维
were the best minds—
心理学思维 哲学思维 心理医生
psychological minds,philosophical minds,psychiatrists—
他们聚在一起讨论
got together and said,
"让我们做一个劳斯莱斯计划吧"
"let's create the Rolls-Royce—there wasn't a Rolls-Royce then—
"这是能想到的最佳干预方案"
but best intervention program that we can think of."
他们没有金钱方面的限制
There was no limit in terms of how much money was put into it.
他们的一切要求都得到了满足
As much as they needed,
他们从受危人群中选了250名孩子
they got and they chose 250 kids from an at-risk population.
干预不是快速修复
And the intervention is not a quick fix,
不是能一夜改变的  他们实行五年干预
overnight change,"we can" seminar-- five-year intervention.
他们所做的是
And here is what they got.
工作人员每月两次探访受试者
Twice a month,case workers visited them,
帮助他们处理家庭中的冲突
helped them deal with the conflicts in the family,
以及处理日常生活中的问题
helped them deal with issues in their lives.
他们中有一半人得到了学院的辅导
Half of them had academic tutoring,those who needed it—
只要有需要 就能得到学术帮助
got help,academic help.
精神科医生也是
Psychiatric attention—
谁有需要 医生都随时候命
all those who needed it,they were there.
你可尽情利用这些资源
No limits on how much you needed it.
无论你需要什么 这些精英都能满足你
Whatever you needed,you got from the best minds in the field.
他们加入了童子军 基督教青年会
They joined the boy scouts,YMCA,
或其他的青年运动 获益良多
other youth movements,benefited a great deal,
从这些经验可看出来
supposedly from these experiences.
他们得到了一切
They got everything.
这简直是梦寐以求的治疗
This would be a dream treatment—
不仅在20世纪30年代 即使在今天也是
not just in the 1930s,today as well.
心理学家做梦也会梦到这些
This is what psychologists dream about at night.
这项研究就是这样进行的
Just introduce this.
调查结果非常重要
And then measuring outcomes was as serious as the program itself.
还有一个随机分派项目
There was a random assignment—
有另外250个孩子 他们什么也没得到
there were 250 kids who got nothing,
也列为了研究对象
who were also studied,
就像受到"五年干预"的孩子一样
just like the kids who got the five-year intervention were studied—
250名对照组的孩子
250 kids in the control group.
40年的追踪调查
40 years follow-up.
这调查不只是今天 明天或五年内的事
This was not just about today,tomorrow for the five years;
而是研究了他们的大半生
they followed them through much of their lives.
这是一项非常严谨的研究
This was serious study.
这是严谨的干预
This was serious intervention.
其结果令人震惊
And the results were shocking.
即使所有参与这项研究的人-
Even though all those who participated in this study—
无论是心理健康学者
whether it was the mental health workers,
哲学家 心理学家
whether it was the philosophers,psychologists,
教授还是精神科医生-
the professors and the psychiatrists—
都说这是最佳 最高效的研究方案
praise the program as the best,as highly effective,
但当他们看到原始的样本数据
when they looked at the raw objective data,
调研结果让他们震惊
the results were shocking.
少年犯罪
Juvenile offenses:
对照组与干预组没有区别
control group versus intervention group-- no difference.
超过三分之一有案底
Over a third had official records
超过20%犯轻罪 无案底
and 20 more percent had unofficial records for misdemeanors.
在少年犯罪方面两组并无差异
No difference in juvenile offenses.
成人后的犯罪率
Adult offenses later on in their lives.
同样没有区别
Again,no difference.
20%以上的犯罪率
Over 20 percent offenses—
无论是对财产或对人所犯的罪
whether against property or against person—
在这两组之间
in both groups: the 250 here versus 250 here,
样本规模相同的两组间
which is significant sample size.
并无差异
No difference whatsoever.
其他测量数据显示
other measures:
身体健康和心理健康 两组没有区别
physical health and mental health—no difference whatsoever.
酗酒方面两组有显著差异
But finally,there was a significant difference on alcoholism,
酗酒人数有差异
the number of people who became
工作地位有差异
alcoholic later on in life as well as job status—
成为白领的人数
how many people were able to
两组有差异
getting to do "the white collar" jobs.
所以至少还是有成果的
So at least there are results there.
至少发现了几点显著的结果
At least they found statistically significant results
当发现这几个差异时
when they came to that.
那很棒吧
That's good,right?
其实不尽然
Not at all.
这些研究结果被扭曲了
Because these results were "in the wrong direction",
这项研究实际表明 干预组酒鬼数量
meaning there were alcoholics in the intervention group
比对照组更多
than in the control group;
1425
对照组更多人
there were more people in the control group
在工作上表现出色
making it at work "raising their status at work"
相较干预组而言
than in the intervention group.
换而言之 干预弊大于利
In other words,intervention did more harm than good.
理想主义 良好意愿 钱财 都是不切实际的
Idealism,good intention,a lot of money wasn't practical.
很多关注这项研究的人
Now many people who look at this study—
这是一个开创性的研究 心理学史上
this is a seminal study—very few studies
很少如此重要的研究
in the history of psychology that were that serious.
他们认为"社会变革应该是不可能的"
They say,"well,societal change is probably not possible".
再给我一分钟 快讲完了
Give me one minute and I'll finish.
他们认为 社会变革是不可能的
Societal change is not possible,they say.
是吗?
Is it?
首先 例外是存在的 我们中也有例外
First of all,there are exceptions and we have exceptions
这证实了规则-有一个真正可行的方案
that prove the rule--there are programs that actually work,
无论是Karen Reivich的研究
whether it's the work again of Karen Reivich
还是宾夕法尼亚大学Martin Seligman的"适应力计划"
and Martin Seligman from U Penn,"resilience program",
Marva Collins肯定是个例外
whether it's Marva Collins who's certainly an exception,
她显示了干预是如何起作用的
who shows how interventions work.
想想以下这个有趣的问题
And it's interesting to think about
Marva所做的事与那项研究的区别
the difference of what Marva Collins does,
她没有给学生权利意识
or she doesn't give the students in sense of entitlement,
她赞扬他们 给他们严厉的爱
or she praises them but she gives them hard love
而不是免费的午餐
as opposed to free lunch,
她没有按需要来将他们分类
or she doesn't label them as needy
那项研究大概是根据需要来划分孩子的
and the study perhaps labeled these kids as needy.
有许多差异
There are many differences.
但研究这个例外的关键是
But the keys to study this exception
大家坐在一切
and for practical idea is to come together
说"什么是可行的?我们研究最好的吧
and to say "what is working? Let's study the best;
研究可行的事 将它应用到生活中"
let's study what works and then apply it."
我们将这思想传播出去
Let's spread the word.
我们根据Maslow20世纪50年代所说的来行事
Let's do what Maslow talked about back in 1950s.
他表明"曼哈顿计划"反驳了
What he suggested is "Manhattan-Project-type attacks
当时最大的问题
upon what I consider to be the truly Big Problems of our time,
这不仅是对心理学 甚至对所有人类都
not only for psychology but for all human beings
带来了历史紧迫感"
with any sense of historical urgency".
曼哈顿计划中 他们创造了原子弹
The Manhattan Project,when they created the atomic bomb
无论你是否同意
and whether or not you agree with
这计划
the Manhattan Project normatively.
很快就说完
One second. I'm almost done.
积极地说 他们汇集了最优秀的人才
Positively,what they did there was bring together the best minds
奥本海默 基拉特 费米费曼 波尔
Oppenheimer,Zillart,Fermi Feinman,Bore—
联合他们 共同拯救自由世界
bring them together with a mission of saving the free world.
无论你是否同意这计划
Again whether you agree or not with the project
积极来说 它都是最伟大的计划
is beside the point,it was the greatest,positively speaking,
聚集起了最优秀的人才
scientific project in history where the minds got together.
这就是Maslow建议心理学家该做的事
This is what Maslow is suggesting that psychologists do.
同时也是积极心理学的目标
This is also the aim of positive psychology,no less than this.
让全世界的人们思考这些问题
You get people around the world to think about these problems,
实际的理想主义者
these issues-- practical idealists
研究可行的方法
who will study what works,
研究最好的个体 他们会带来改变
who will study the best and through that,make a difference.
下周再见
I'll see you next week.
