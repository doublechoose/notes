幸福课 中英字幕 [第7课]逆境还是机遇？
我们今天的课OK,so,what we're gonna do today要把自我实现预言的信念讲完is finish up with the beliefs of self-fulfilling prophecy lecture并开始讲下一课 关于专注and move on to the lecture on focus和专注如何创造现实and how focus creates reality.我们上一课讲到哪里?Where did we end last time?我们讲到Rena和其他的一些事We ended by talking about Rena and other things.我们讲到模型 Dan Gilbert的模型We talked about the model,the Dan Gilbert model,Philip Brickman模型the Philip Brickman model,成功或失败过后 会有大起大落where after a failure or a success there is a spike up,但我们会恢复过来spike down,but then we recover.我们一生基本沿基准的幸福发展And we basically move along a base level of well being其中有起伏和变迁through out our lives,with the ups and downs,the vicissitudes.所以问题是The question then became,或说有好消息也有坏消息or rather there was good news and bad news.好消息是 我们不必太过担心The good news was,we don't really need to worry that much,我们能冒更多风险 也更容易回到基准线上we can take more risks,we can put ourselves on the line more.失败往往 虽然不是所有的失败Failure usually,not all failures,往往只是使幸福水平暂时的下降but usually is just a temporary decline in our wellbeing level,还有自尊水平 然后会迅速回升self esteem level,and then every quickly we jump up again.所以这是好消息So that's the good news.坏消息是 如果我们总是回到原来的水平The bad news is: if we're just around the same base level,那我们为什么要努力寻求幸福呢?you know,why should we put any effort into our wellbeing?而答案And the answer to that,这整个课程本质上就是对它进行回答and the whole course essentially is an answer to that.我们如何提升基准水平?How can we raise that base level?一个方法是去面对 把自己置于风险之上One of the things is coping,putting ourselves on the line.我们这么做的原因And the reason why coping,是因为这样能产生积极的影响why putting ourselves on the line yields positive结果 幸福基准会上升results in terms of the base level of wellbeing going up,意思是仍然有起有落meaning still the ups and downs,但起伏是像这样斜线上升的but ups and downs looking this way而不是在一条直线上或者as opposed to around a straight line平行线上徘徊 我们去面对时能想象我们的行动or a parallel line is that when we cope,we see ourselves coping,想象自己在努力 通过自我知觉理论we see ourselves trying and through self perception theory,我们对自己做某种总结we derive certain conclusions about ourselves:我一定很勇敢oh,I must be courageous;我一定是自尊心强的人oh,I must be a person who has high self esteem;我一定是非常渴望成功的人oh,I must be a person who has a strong desire to succeed等等and so on and so on.然后我们给自己做出的结论And then we derive conclusions about ourselves in the same way就像我们给他人的结论一样that we derive conclusions about other people.这就是自我知觉理论That is self-perception theory.第二个原因是一旦我们经常经历失败The second reason is that once we started failing more often,我们会意识到那其实并不那么糟糕we realized that actually it's not that bad,不像我们想象的那么糟it's not what we make it out to be.我们脑中想象的失败的痛苦The pain that in our minds we associate with failure比实际的痛苦要多得多is far greater that the actual pain of failure when that comes.也许不是即时的 而是稍后才感受到Maybe not initially when it happens,but after a while;当我们恢复后 就知道我能应付它and then we recover again,and we see,oh,I can deal with it,我一定是一个有适应力的人I must be a person with resilience.最终 努力去面对后会有更多成功And finally,there is more success as a result of coping.学习失败 或在失败中学习Learn to fail,or fail to learn,成功没有其他途径there is no other way to succeed.我现在要说的是So what I want to move on to now and just finish up on我们如何变得更乐观is how do we become more of an optimistic.我们谈过优点 谈过长寿So we talked about the virtues,we talked about longevity,乐观的人实际上活得更久people who are optimistic actually live longer.我们谈过更高水平的成功We talked about higher levels of success,更高程度的快乐更能克服忧郁higher levels of happiness,more likely to overcome depression.乐观的人People who are optimistic患上忧郁的机会是八分之一are eight times less likely to be depressed;他们会更快乐they are much more likely to be happy.再说一遍 乐观是指诠释的方式And again,optimism as an interpretation style,而不是盲目地自我感觉良好的方式not as a Pollyannaish feel-good kind of approach.我们如何变得更加乐观?So how do we become more of an optimism?我想谈谈三个方法I want to talk about three techniques.首先是采取行动 尽管去做First is to take action,to just do it,把自己置于风险之上to put ourselves on the line.第二点 我要讲想象力Second,I'm going to talk about the power of imagination,形象化的力量 你们许多人熟悉这点visualization,many of you are familiar with that,尤其对运动员而言 作为一项技巧especially athletes as,as a technique.我们要谈论这个技巧So we'll talk about that technique.最后一点是认知疗法And finally,cognitive therapy,至少研究表明 是当今最成功的which at least according to research,is the most successful,最有效的治疗干预手段most effective therapeutic intervention out there today,我们要讲一些基本要素并进行归纳so we'll talk about some of the basics and summarize those.我们先说行动So let me begin with action,这是基于Albert Bendura的研究this is based on research by Albert Bendura,你们会了解到自我效能you'll read about self-efficacy,他的基本概念上是要有坚定的信念his concept basically the idea of having strong believes他将它描述得更学术化and he just made it more academic,更科学化 并研究了数年more scientific and researched for many years我们谈过自我效能的许多益处and we talked about many benefits of self efficacy.Bendura所做的大部分工作是反对What Bendura is coming out against in much of his work人们称为“自尊运动”的活动is what has become known as the self esteem movement,或者说他反对的是or he's coming against被称为“感觉良好运动”的活动what has become known as feel good movement.所谓的 告诉小孩他们有多好Alright,so tell a child how great they are,他们有多棒how wonderful they are.每天早上站在镜子前对自己说Standing in front of a mirror every morning and tell yourself:“你好精神”十遍 你将更成功hi,gorgeous ten times,and then you will be more successful,你的自尊会提升 你会变得很好your self esteem will be high and you'll be gorgeous.这不管用 相信我 这不管用It doesn't work,believe me it doesn't work.我都试过 实际上经常I've tried everything. The thing though is that very often,事实上长期以往会造成伤害 会伤到自尊it actually hurts in the long term,it actually hurts self esteem它实际伤害了那些学生的积极性it actually hurts the motivation of students他们经常被夸奖说"你们很棒"who are constantly told you are wonderful,"你们都很了不起"you are terrific no matter what.我们会讲如何对赞扬更有辨识力And we'll talk about how we can be more discerning with praise,如何正确地赞扬how we can praise in the right way在我们过几周谈论Carol Dweckwhen we talked about the work of Carol Dweck关于心态的文章的时候on mindsets in a few weeks.同时Bendura表明In the meantime,what Bendura showed,Carol Dweck表明what Carol Dweck showed,还有其他许多人都表明 这还不够what many others showed was that it's not enough,通常情况 只给你积极的言论 积极的肯定very often,its even detrimental to just give the,you know,无论来自外部或内部positive,positive talk,the positive affirmation.这甚至是有害的Whether it comes from the outside or from the inside,这也许其中的一部分 但不是全部maybe part of the equation,certainly can't be all.Bendura说的是 我们需要的是行动而不是空谈What Bendura is saying,that rather than talk,we need action.我们对任何事都要付出努力We need to put hard work into whatever it is,我们想变得更自信 就需要去应对we want to be more confident about,and we need to cope.我们要把自己置于风险之上 很简单 为什么?We need to put ourselves on the line. Very simple! Why?因为努力和面对必然能获得成功Because hard work and coping inevitably leads to success,至少比以前more success at least than we had before,以前不行动 不去面对时要成功when we didn't act and we didn't cope.即使只是一点点成功的贡献So even if it's a little bit,in and of itself contributes,也有助于提高自我效能that success contributes to our self-efficacy,有助于增加自信 而自信反过来to our self confidence. And then,that self confidence in turns,反过来激励我们更努力in turn motivates us to work harder.我们开始更加相信自己We started to believe ourselves more.这是个很简单的模型 我是说任何人Now,this is a very simple model,I mean,anyone you know,一个五岁小孩都能做出那个模型the five year old could draw that model.然而考虑到对我们生活的影响However think about the implications for our lives,考虑到对教育的影响think about the implications for education,我们应该仅是对学生不停地说你们很棒do we just tell students constantly you're terrific,你们真厉害 还是应该像Marva Collins那样you're wonderful,you're great,or do we like Marva Collins,让他们努力奋斗获得更多成功make them actually work hard so that they succeed more,让他们想象自己回归自我概念理论so that they see themselves going back to self conception theory,想象自己努力奋斗see themselves working hard,想象自己投身其中see themselves putting themselves on the line,面对失败 重新站起coping and failing,and getting up again.133它和我们身体免疫系统运作方式相同It works also in a similar way to our physical immune system.当我们身体不适 当我们生病时You know when we get sick,when we get ill,我们的身体感应到抗体our body sense anti-bodies我们实际上会免疫得过的病and we actually become immune to whatever it is that we had.我们的身体通过失败获得免疫力So our body become immunize through failure.在心理层面也相同 失败会被低估Same on the psychological level,failure is underrated.我希望你们拥有的东西之一You know one of the things that I wish for you,我是很真挚的and I mean it genuinely.希望你们能多经历失败One of the things that I wish for you is that you fail more.我不是随便说说 我真这么想的I'm not saying it ingest,I really do.另外 我希望当你们失败时And,coupled with that,I hope that when you fail,你们也能学习用不同的方式去诠释you will also learn to interpret it in a different way而不像大多数人那样诠释失败than most of us usually interpret failure.因为没有别的方式取得成功'Cause there is no other way to succeed,成长的途径只有这一条there is no other way for growth,像这样的生活 只是在逃避it's an elusion that a life looks like this,我们会继续谈这个we will talk about it much more当我们谈论完美主义时when we talk about perfectionism.健康的生活 真实的生活A healthy life,a real life,快乐的生活基本都看起来像这样and a happy life ultimately looks like this,一个带起伏的螺旋 不是一条直线a spiral with ups and downs,not as a straight line.当我们看到自己去面对 努力奋斗时When we see ourselves cope,when we see ourselves work hard,我们对自己做出结论we derive conclusions about ourselves,我们的自信增长 我们的动力增加our self confidence goes up,our motivation goes up,我们的信仰上升 等等our belief goes up and so on and so on以一个上升螺旋的趋势发展in an upward spiral of growth.Soren Kierkegaard说过"勇于冒险或许会一时失足Soren Kierkegaard: "To dare is to lose one's footing momentarily.却步不前则会迷失自我”Not to dare is to lose oneself."当我们去面对 去尝试 满怀期望时To lose one's footing temporarily is the failure一时失足而导致失败that comes inevitably when we cope,when we try,不可避免 而我们不去应对 选择逃避when we have high expectations. Not to dare is to lose oneself,却步不前则会迷失自我that is when we don't cope,when we avoid.因为这个模型倒过来也成立Because this model also works the other way around.当我们不断地逃避挑战When we constantly avoid challenges,当我们总能处理好困难经历when we constantly shone difficult experiences,当我们不允许自己失败时when we don't give ourselves the permission to fail,会形成一个向下的螺旋 影响自尊a downward spiral is created,in terms of our self esteem,我们的成功和幸福in terms of our success,in terms of our well being.第二个技巧 想象成功Second technique: imagining success.有件事我想和你们分享Now there's one thing I want to share with you,要和你们分享让我有点紧张I'm a little bit nervous about sharing it00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,830但既然已经说开了 无论如何我都会说but I'll do it anyway,you know,since we've opened up,尤其上节课真是我们关系中的转折点especially last time was a real milestone in our relationship.我要告诉你们些事 但别告诉别人I'm gonna to tell you something but please don't tell anyone,尤其别告诉我的客户you know,especially don't tell any of my clients或将来的潜在客户or potential clients in the future.我演讲前会非常紧张I get really nervous before lectures.我会很紧张 其实对我而言I get very nervous,in fact for me,我无论何时站在许多观众面前whenever I stand in front of a large audience,心里会七上八下的there're butterflies in my stomach.我觉得这很难And it's very difficult for me我说的许多观众是指多于五人when I talk about large audience its anything above five.所以这是个真正的挑战So,this is a real challenge,当我和客户们聊天时是个挑战it's a real challenge when I talk to clients.这一直是一个挑战 从我决定And this is been a challenge since the dash I decided当一名教师的那一刻起 当我听说了that I want to be a teacher and I decidedMarva Collins的事迹时就决定成为一名老师that I want to be a teacher when I heard Marva Collins,我说"这就是对我的召唤" 后来我就成为了老师and I said: this is my calling. And here is what happened then.我曾说 "如果我在人们面前会这么紧张I said,how can I be a successful teacher and effective teacher我要如何成为成功而有效率的老师?"if I get so nervous when I stand in front of an audience?记得成功的三要素And remember the three components of success,成功的秘密? 是乐观和自信the secret of success? It was optimism,believe in oneself;是热情 热爱你所做的 还有努力奋斗it was passion,loving what you do; and it was hard work.我有其中两个要素So I had two of the three components.我非常努力 实际上我的座右铭I worked extremely hard,in fact my motto has become,来自Richard Hackman教授one that I got from Professor Richard Hackman,他是我在这里读本科时的论文导师as my thesis advisor as an undergrad here.他是一个非凡的教师And,what he said,he's a phenomenal teacher,他走进教室后会说and what he said when he goes into a classroom is the following:准备 再准备...然后顺其自然prepare,prepare,prepare,and then be spontaneous.所以我遵照他的建议 我仔细看教案So I followed his advise,now I read over my notes,我准备好所有教案 然后不再去想它I have all the notes written down and then I can let go.我准备得很充足 我很努力 没问题So I prepare a lot,I have the hard work,not a problem.我有热情 我爱学习I have the passion,I love learning,这是我职业生命中最重要的事it's the most important thing,professionally in my life.但我缺少第三样 缺少乐观But I lacked the third thing,I lacked optimism,缺少自信 我问我自己and I lacked confidence. And then I asked myself:我要怎样提高第三个要素how can I raise the third components因为这是幸福的一个重要部分because it is important component of wellbeing,记得对运动员的研究吗?remember the research on athletes?56%的成功56% of the variance is accounted of success,是源自乐观主义或自信is accounted for by the sense of optimism or belief in yourself.还记得John Carter二十年前的研究吗Remember the John Carter study? Twenty years along关于哈佛大学商学院毕业生的when you look at Harvard Business School graduates,将最成功的学生和其他人区分开的one of the two components that两要素之一differentiated the most successful from the rest,一个是相信自己 自信one of them was belief in themselves,confidence.这是成功的一个重要因素 而我缺少它It's an important component of success and I lacked it.我怎么办? 我回想到So what did I do? I went back and thought about打壁球时的事情what happened when I played squash,我的教练过去教育我要形象化what my coaches used to teach me,and that was visualization.我开始阅读这方面内容And I started reading up and我查看文献时 看到很多关于这方面的研究when I looking at literature and there's a lot of research on it,实际上在几世纪前宗教实践时就出现it actually started off centuries ago in religious practices,被东欧运动员引入到体育运动中was brought to athletics through east European athletes他们会想象自己 比如who would imagine themselves,say,在跑道上跑然后站在颁奖台上running around the track and then standing on the podium,领取金牌receiving the gold medal.越来越多的心理学家把它应用起来And more and more psychologists started to implement it.销售人员很有效地使用它Sales people use it very effectively,想象自己真的谈成了生意seeing themselves actually striking the deal,经历困难 去做 并获得成功going through with it,doing it and succeeding.那让它更有可能成为现实And that made it much more likely to come true.为什么?形象化背后有什么原理?The question is why? What's the mechanism behind visualization?为什么这么重要?为什么它这么好?Why is it so important? Why is it so good?为什么它这么有效?Why is it so effective?为什么被这么广泛而成功地使用?Why it being used so widely and successfully?答案归结到我们大脑的结构上And the answer goes back to the structure of our brains.这个研究是由心理系主任This is research done by the head of psychology department,Stephen Kosslyn教授做的Professor Steven Kosslyn.他说当我们看某样东西时What he shows was that when we see something,比如说我现在看着我的手so let's say I'm looking at my hand right now.我大脑中的某些神经元被激活There are certain neurons in my brain that are firing,实际上记住了这只手的形状that actually take on the shape of this hand.我的视觉皮质 后部My visual cortex,the back.现在Now,如果我闭上眼想象我在看这只手if I close my eyes and imagine that I'm looking at this hand,即使它不在那 如果我想象看这只手even if it's not here,if I imagine that I look at this hand,相同的神经元会激活 换句话说the exact same neurons are firing. In other words,我的大脑无法区别my brain does not know the difference真实的事物和想象的事物between the real thing and the imaginary thing.这解释了为什么梦境会那么生动Which explains why dreams can be so vivid,在漆黑的深夜n the middle of the night,pitch dark,你正梦到中午and you are dreaming about mid of the day,在院子里散步walking around the yard.我们的想象Our imagination,至少对于大脑而言与现实没有区别least for the brain is no different than the real thing.当我想象成功时 从某种意义上说Now,when I imagine success,what happens in a sense is我在为大脑做一个模拟that I'm creating a simulator for my mind.我可以说是在欺骗大脑认为And I'm in a sense fooling my mind into thinking这是真的事情that this is the real thing.我的大脑不知道两者的区别My mind doesn't know the difference between the two.潜意识无法区分Subconscious mind doesn't know the difference真实的事物和假想的事物between the real thing and the imaginary thing.如果我在脑海中反复想象着成功Now if I imagine success over and over again in my mind,记住大脑不喜欢不一致性remember what the mind does not like is inconsistency.换句话说In other words,如果我想象着成功并坚持不懈if I create success in my imagination and I persist with it,不止设想一两次 而是一次又一次not just visualize it once or twice,but over and over again,大脑不喜欢不一致性the mind doesn't like inconsistencies.因此它会让外部现实And therefore,it will bring up the external reality和内心的想象相符to match this internal schema.为什么?因为大脑不知道Why? Because the mind doesn't know真实的事物和假想的事物间的区别the difference in the real thing and imaginary thing.就像ThomasJust like Thomas,就像Roger Bannister四分钟内跑完一英里just like Roger Bannister run the four minutes a mile在那之后and after that,after that what happened was每个人都有了和以往不同的想法that everyone had a different schema:四分钟跑完一英里是可能的 然后37人成功了Oh,four minutes a mile is possible and 37 runners run it,第二年超过300人实现了over 300 runners run it the following year.因为他们有了不同的想法Because they had a difference schema:我们可以通过场景模拟做到同样的事情we can do exactly the same thing through the simulator.因为大脑无法区分Cause the mind doesn't know the difference真实的事物和假想的事物in the real thing and the imaginary thing.不是总能成功Doesn't work all the time,不是百分之一百管用doesn't work a hundred percent of the time,但很多时候都很管用but it works a great deal.我每次演讲总要设想一下What I do every time when I give a lecture is visualize.我想象自己站在观众前I imagine myself stand in front of the audience,冷静 激动 热情calm,excited,passionate.当我正式开始演讲时And then when I go into the real thing,现在我不知道这是真的还是想象的now I don't know if it is the real thing or I'm imaging,但我假设这是真的but I assume it's the real thing.正式开始演讲时 我确实有同样的感受When I go into the real thing,I do feel that.我仍然会紧张 仍然会焦虑I still get nervous,I still get anxious,但这是健康的兴奋but it's a healthy,excitement.通过练习提高了我的信心和自信水平Raising my levels of beliefs,levels of confidence by practicing,就像一个...一个飞行员just like a flight... a pilot,you would hope...会希望能在模拟环境中先练习would practice in a simulator然后再飞越大西洋before they take you on across the Atlantic.思想是个模拟器 所以它能管用The mind as a simulator,this is why it works.关键是... 这有一个许多人都犯过的错误The key here,this is a mistake that many people make,无论是运动员或是...whether it's athletics or whether it's in the,许多关于形象化自励书籍中的记载a lot of the self-help books that talked about visualizations.关键是不仅仅只关注结果The key is to focused not just on the destination,加州大学洛杉矶分校的Shelley TaylorShelley Taylor,UCLA,做了研究 把学生随机分成两组did this research where she divided students in two random groups一个学生想象在考试中得到AOne student imaging themselves getting an A on the exam一遍遍地这样想象and imagine it over and over again.第二组想象他们得到AThe second group,imaging themselves getting an A但也想象他们在图书馆坚持努力but also saw themselves work and persist in the library,为考试做准备 最后得到了Aprepare for it,and then,get to that final A.第二组想象了过程The second group that imaging both the journey和结果 他们更加成功and the destination was much more successful,考试成绩更好much better result in the exam.想象过程和结果So visualize the journey as well as the destination,这是你们这周的作业this is your response paper for this week,想象你们实现目的to visualize both your destination of getting there,你们实现目的的过程以及目的本身your journey of getting there,as well as the destination itself.史上最有影响力的演讲 或者之一Arguably,the most,or certainly one of the most influential是马丁路德金的《我有一个梦想》speeches of all time was Martin Luther King's I have a dream.这个演讲我听了不下12次I've read this speech more than dozens of times.为什么?因为除了它很美 押韵和重要性之外Why? Because beyond its beauty,its rhythm and its importance,也表达了它的意图it also captures what is means,它的意图就是描绘出一幅成功的画面what it means to create an image of success.因为这是他为这个国家做的'Cause this is what he did for this country并为后来人所定义的远景and defined generations to come.因此首先 我想从中摘录几句So first of all,I want to read some excerpts from it.是对一个更美好的未来的想象It is about visualizating a better future,他说得很明确 没有隐藏and he says it explicitly,doesn't hide it."我有一个梦想 朋友们 今天我对你们说He says: "I have a dream,I say to you today my friends,在此时此刻 我们虽然遭受种种困难和挫折so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow我仍然有一个梦想I still have a dream.这个梦想是深深扎根于美国的梦想中的"It is a dream deeply rooted in the America dream."这都是关于想象This is all about imagination,但通过想象他创建了更好的现实but through the imagination he created a better reality.看他如何谈论这个过程Look at how he talks about the process;他不是仅仅谈到结果he doesn't talk just about the outcome:我们希望最后达到平等we want equality at the end.他谈的是我们如何获得这个结果He talks about how we will get to this outcome.让我读几句摘录的句子So let me read you a couple of excerpts:"现在绝非侈谈冷静下来"This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off或服用渐进主义的镇静剂的时候"or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism."多优美 我是说 他这里说的是How beautiful! I mean,what he's saying here is,我们别只坐着等待let's not just sit here and wait想象会发生的事情and imagine that things will happen,让我们做些事情 让我们也着眼于过程let's do something,let's also have a process.他明确地说And he says explicitly:"在争取合法地位的过程中"In the process of gaining our rightful place,我们不要采取错误的做法"we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds."这里他在提建议 提议So here he's talking about advice,of suggestions,advice,这个过程中什么该做 什么不该做what we should and shouldn't do along the way."我们斗争时必须永远举止得体"We must forever conduct our struggle纪律严明 我们不能容许on the high play of dignityand discipline. We must not allow我们的具有崭新内容的抗议蜕变为暴力行动"our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence."他在描述一个过程He's describing a process."我们要不断地升华到"Again and again,we must rise to the majestic heights以精神力量对付物质力量的崇高境界中去"of meeting physical force with soul force."我们要做的另一件事Another thing that we need to do当我们想象成功时 尽可能逼真点when we imagine success is to make is as real as possible尽量使人有所感受 为什么?by involving as many senses as we can. Why?因为感受越真实Because the more senses we can imagine,我们的大脑就越相信这是真实的the more our mind is fooled to believe that it is the real thing.再次 马丁路德金这点上也做得非常漂亮Once again,Martin Luther King does this beautifully.让我读几句摘录的句子Let me read you a few excerpts:"我们将来也不满足 除非正义和公正犹如江海之波涛"We will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters汹涌澎湃 滚滚而来"and righteousness like a mighty stream."你们能感受到那江海波涛I mean,you can feel the water,you can feel that stream,你们能看到 能想象到you can see it,you can visualize it."我们不要为了满足对自由的渴望"Or,let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom而抱着苦味和仇恨之杯痛饮"by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred."他引入了味觉 苦味等同于仇恨He's employing test,bitterness,equaling with hatred.375人们会联想到它 让它真实 具体化People connect to it,making it real,concrete."有朝一日 阿拉巴马州的黑人男孩和女孩"One day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls将能与白人男孩和女孩情同骨肉will be able to join hands with携手并进"little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers."你能想象到孩子们手拉手围成圈I mean,you can see that circle of the kids holding hand,再次让它变得真实 你可以想象到 看到它again making it real,you can visualize it,you see it.顺便说下 这是所有著名演讲的特征By the way,these are the characteristics of all great speeches.它们不是抽象的They are not abstract,看看那"伟大的沟通者"罗纳德里根look at the great communicator Ronald Reagan.看肯尼迪Look at Kennedy.他们演讲很精彩 因为他们创造了一幅图画They gave amazing speeches because they created a picture,他们利用了感官 创造了一幅成功的画面they involve the senses,they created a picture of success."我梦想有一天 甚至连密西西比州"I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi,这个正义匿迹 压迫成风a state sweltering with the heat of injustice,如同沙漠般的地方weltering with the heat of oppression will be transformed也将变成自由和正义的绿洲"into an oasis of freedom and justice."你真的能感受到那种酷热You can actually feel the heat,你真的能感受到他描述的那种汗如雨下的感觉you can actually feel the sweat that he's describing.这描绘出了一幅好的 成功的画面This is what makes good,successful images.这让演讲变得很精彩This is what makes great speeches.最后 要唤起情绪And finally,it's about evoking emotions.你不想只是做一个认知练习You don't want just make it cognitive exercise,你要对自己正在做的感到非常兴奋you wanna really be excited about what you are doing,否则将会失败 什么都没有改变or else it will fall flat. Nothing,no change will happen.这些词语间的联系 情感和行动Again,the connection between the words emotion and motion:没有情感就没有行动without emotion,there is no motion.如果你想让自己或别人行动起来If you want to move yourself or others,你得引起情感共鸣you need to evoke emotions.让我们稍微看看那段历史性的演讲Let's look at,just a minute,of that historical speech."让自由之声响彻每个山岗"From every mountain side,let freedom ring!如果美国要成为一个伟大的国家 这个梦想必须实现And if America is to be a great nation,this must become true.所以And so让自由之声从新罕布什尔州的巍峨的崇山峻岭响起来let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire.让自由之声从纽约州的崇山峻岭响起来Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York.让自由之声从宾夕法尼亚州的阿勒格尼山脈上响起来Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania让自由之声从科罗拉多州冰雪覆盖的落基山响起来Let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado.让自由之声从加利福尼亚州蜿蜒的群峰响起来Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California.不仅如此But not only that:还要让自由之声从佐治亚州的石岭响起来Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia.让自由之声从田纳西州的了望山响起来Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee.让自由之声从密西西比的每一座丘陵响起来Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi.让自由之声从每一片山坡响起来From every mountainside,let freedom ring.当这成真 我们使自由之声响彻时And when this happens,when we allow freedom ring,当我们让自由之声从每一个大小村庄when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet,每一个州和每一个城市响起来时 我们将能够加速from every state and every city,we will be able to speed up这一天的到来 那时 上帝的所有儿女 黑人和白人that day when all of God's children,black men and white men,犹太教徒和非犹太教徒 基督教徒和天主教徒Jews and Gentiles,Protestants and Catholics,都将手携手 合唱一首will be able to join hands and sing古老的黑人灵歌in the words of the old Negro spiritual,"终于自由啦！终于自由啦！"Free at last! Free at last!感谢全能的上帝，我们终于自由啦"Thank God Almighty,we are free at last!"我看过十几遍 每次看都很激动I've seen this as I said dozens of times,every time excitement.假想你最后说 终于自由啦 终于自由啦Imagine if you said at the end: Free at last! Free at last!全能的上帝 终于自由啦 有同样效果吗God Almighty,free at last! Would that have the same effect?无聊 枯燥 你必须引发情感来创造行动Boring,dry,you have to evoke emotions to create motion,不论是在想象中或是对全国人演讲whether is in our imagination or in a speech to the nation另一个技巧 另一个我要说的技巧Another technique...Another technique that I'd like to talk about,第三个技巧 第一个是 努力行动起来the third technique. So the first one was: work,投入其中 去面对put yourself on the line,cope,invest.第二个 使用想象力The second: use your imagination,使用思想的模拟器use the simulator that you have right here,一个我们所知的最强大的模拟器one of the most if not the most powerful simulator we know of.第三是 认知疗法The third is cognitive therapy.认知疗法已被成功地运用四十多年Cognitive therapy has been used very successfully over the last,Martin Seligman是认知疗法的over forty years,Martin Seligman was one of the founders创始人之一of the cognitive therapy approach.他和Beck一起做研究He studied with,with Beck,Beck是这技巧的正式创始人who was the official founder of this technique in this approach.认知疗法的内容如下And what cognitive therapy is about is the following.它的基本前提是思想驱动情感Its basic premise is that thoughts drive emotion.比如 外部发生一件事So for example: there is an external event.我感知到那件事I perceive that event,我感知那件事后的行动是and what I do then after I perceive that event,对那事进行评估there is evaluation of that event,也就是对那件事进行思考in other words,a thought about that event.思考后就唤起了情感And then,as a result of that thought,that evokes an emotion.比如 事件 有只狮子向我奔来So for example,an event,a lion is running toward me,我的评估 天 它要吃掉我my evaluation: oh my god,he's gonna eat me.引发的情感是恐惧 然后自然就导致行动The emotion: fear,and that of course leads to motion,逃跑或勇敢地和狮子搏斗run away or stand up bravely and fight the lion.或另一个例子 一个事件Or,another one: I see an event,一个美女在街上走 我的评估a gorgeous woman walking down the street,my evaluation:是我的漂亮太太 引发的情感是爱oh,it's my gorgeous wife,and the emotion:love.事件 评估 思考 情感Event,evaluation,thought,emotion,然后导致行动and then that leads to action.认知疗法认为如果我们想改变情感What cognitive therapy says is that if we want to change emotions无论是忧郁或焦虑whether it's of depression,whether it's of anxiety,我们要干预的是where we need to intervene is here,评估和想法层面is that the level of evaluation and the level of thought.如果能改变这个 我们的情感也随着改变And if we can change that,we also change our emotion.特别地 认知疗法认为Specifically,what cognitive therapy saying is that我们要恢复理性意识we need to restore sense of rationality,我们要恢复真实 当然这不是说we need to restore the real,it's certainly not saying,比如 我有let's say I have a,you know,一个非常重要的试镜 我很紧张a very important try out coming up and I get nervous.认知疗法不是说停止紧张Cognitive therapy is not saying stop feeling nervous,我们改变你的评估 或你的想法let's change your evaluation or your thoughts,因为那是自然的 又或者我站在狮子面前because that's natural or I stand in front of a lion.感到害怕是自然的 重要的 健康的体验It's natural,it's important,it's healthy to experience fear.但是But它说的是我们的想法有时是荒谬的what it is saying is that sometimes our thoughts are irrational,我们上节课提到过 比如and we'll mention that last time,for example,我有一次考试成绩不好I don't do well on one test我立刻认为自己很笨and immediately I classified myself as stupid或认为我考试永远不会取得好成绩or the fact that I will never succeed in tests again.或者 我约别人出去 被拒绝了Or,you know,I asked someone out and he says no,突然觉得没有人需要我and suddenly nobody wants me.这个事件引发一个荒谬的想法That event led to an irrational thought,对情景的荒谬评估irrational evaluation of the situation.那只是一次性的 短暂的失败It was just once,it was temporary,而那会引发不好的情感 比如放弃and that led to difficult emotions such as resignation:没人会再需要我了nobody will ever want me again.而认知疗法做的是恢复理性And what cognitive therapy does is just restore通过说“是的 这很伤人 很痛苦”that rationality by saying: yeah,it hurts,it's tough,但你知道 哈佛还有3200个其他男人but,you know they are,what? 3200 other men at Harvard.认知疗法极其有效Cognitive therapy has been shown to be extremely effective,比其他干预手段都更有效more effective than any of the other intervention,虽然它对于the jury still out极端棘手的精神病理学病例不太管用when it comes to extreme cases of psychopathology,但对于大多数精神病理学病例 多数的焦虑症状but in terms of most psychopathologies,most anxiety,多数的忧郁症状 它已经被证明是最成功的most depression,it has been shown to be the most successful,且起效最快的方法 它不仅有用and it works the fastest. Not the only thing that works,而且最有效 最迅速but it works the best and much more promptly相对其他干预而言than the other interventions.总体上 不是人人有效 但大多数有效On the whole,not right for everyone,but for most people.最后 这是我们能学会的重要的内容And finally,and this is the important thing we can learn it.我们提过So we talk about right?五年的剑桥-萨默维尔研究失败了The five-year Cambridge Somerville study that failed.Karen Reivich在一个两周的项目中Well,Karen Reivich teaches these cognitive skills教授这些认知技巧in a two week program.那个两周的项目旨在帮助市中心的And that two week program helps kids in inner cities,危险人群中的孩子们at risk population,降低陷入忧郁和吸毒困境的可能性reduce the likelihood of falling into the trap of depression,增加幸福的可能性of drug abuse,increases the likelihood of wellbeing这个为期两周的认知疗法或技巧的课程and success in the long term just as a result结果在长远看来是成功的of two weeks teaching them cognitive therapy or these techniques,所以这是可以学到的技能so it's an accquired skill这就是重要之处and this is the important thing about it.不是说很容易That doesn't mean its easy,不是说你听了一次课doesn't mean you're just gonna hear a lecture now for the,下面的十分钟我要讲一些概念the next ten minutes I'm gonna describe some of the ideas就能改变你的生活 你要运用它and that's gonna change your life. You need to apply it,你们将要把它运用到之后两节and you are going to apply it in the next two,之后两节课中 但你们要做的更多next two classes,but you need to do more than that.我给你们讲下认知疗法的概要So let me share with you a summary of cognitive therapy这三个M是首字母缩写and this...the 3Ms is my acronym.我所做的是从本质上把And what I did there was to put together essentially the work我刚提到的Karen Reivich的成果of Karen Reivich whom I just mentioned,Martin Seligman的成果the work of Martin Seligman,Seligman的老师Aaron Beck的成果the work of Aaron Beck Seligman's teacher还有David Burns的成果 你们也许有人知道他and the work of David Burns. Some of you may heard of him,《好心情手册》的作者 也是Aaron Beck的学生The Feeling Good Handbook,who is also a student of Aaron Beck.把他们的成果结合起来So this is putting together their work成为三个M 每个M有二个建议into 3Ms subdivided each into 2 suggestions.你们会看到它们互相有联系They're inter connected as you'll see.区别不怎么明显 但你们会注意到It's not a very clear distinction. However what you'll notice is你们总能联系上三M中的一两个you could usually relate to one or two of the 3Ms.在你们行动之前先问自己Things that you do yourself. So beyond the lookout ask yourself:“我在哪处扭曲了事实?"Where do I distort the reality?我在评估方面 或者Where do I have distortion in terms of evaluation?想法方面哪里歪曲了事实?”In terms of my thought?"导致了某些不必要的消极情绪That lead to certain negative emotions that are unnecessary,因为如果我恢复理性because if I restore rationality我就感觉不到同样程度的情感I will not feel the same emotion to the same degree.所以当你们学习三个M的时候问自己So ask yourself when you look through the 3Ms.三个M指的是非理性想法的三个陷阱The 3Ms...essentially the 3 traps of irrational thoughts.第一个是放大The first one is magnifying.就是夸大发生的事情 比如It's exaggerating something that happens. For example,归纳法是天生的本能you know induction is something very natural.一个孩子看到这个 会叫它凳子A kid sees this and will call it a stool然后他们在酒吧看到另一张凳子and then they see another stool in the bar当他们一岁时出去when they go out at the age of one再看到另一张凳子 看过20张凳子后and then they see another stool. After they see 20 stools开始形成一个观念 认为这东西就是凳子they begin to form a concept they induce that this is a stool.现在他们看到一张And now they see one even one以前从没见过的凳子 他们也知道是它什么that they have never seen before they know what it is.就像我看见一个人在街上Just like I see a person in the street以前从没见过他 我知道这是个人whom I never encounter before I know this is a person,因为我从其他发生过的事件中because I induce from all the other events归纳出这个也是一个人that happened before that this is also a person.这就是归纳法 是健康的 重要的So that's induction. That's healthy. That's important.我们就是这样形成观念和语言的That's how we develop concepts and language.但有时我们做得过头 归纳过度了But sometimes we take this too far and we over generalize.比如 我期中考成绩很差Once again,I did poorly on the midterm...conclusion,归纳为 我不聪明 我不能成功generalization: I'm just not smart. I just can't succeed.这个学生就是归纳过度了 他的评估Here is a student. Over generalization,the evaluation,他的想法是非理性的the thought,irrational.或他拒绝了我 因此大家都会拒绝我Or he just said no to me. Everyone is gonna say no.而不是实事求是地说 "看看周围instead of being realistic and saying,"wow,just look around.1504课堂上还有有很多帅哥"There are so many wonderful and sensitive and caring men in 1504"另一件事我们经常讨论的是So,another thing this is something we'll talk about a lot...全有或全无态度the All or Nothing approach. The All or Nothing...我们会在讲完美主义时讨论它we'll talk about it when we talk about perfectionism.它是把失败小题大做It's catastrophizing failure,而不是把失败当做一次机遇not seeing failure as an opportunity,一个跳板 而是视之为世界末日as a stepping stone but seeing it as the end of the world.我大一时得了B 现在要无家可归了I got a B as a freshman. Now I'm going to be homeless.永远找不到工作 全有或全无Not finding a job ever. All or Nothing.要么全是A 要么就是彻底的失败Either straight As or complete failure.我们会多次提及它We'll talk about that a lot.因为这是阻止我们去面对的一个关键要素Because it's one of the key elements that prevents us from coping阻止我们投入进去from putting ourselves on the line.它的另一面The other side of it,同一个硬币的另一面 是极小化which is actually other side of the same coin is minimizing.这是我经常做的This is something I do very often.这是我仍要警惕的陷阱This is my trap that I still have to be aware of,我至今仍会考虑I still think about today,虽然我几年前就注意到它了even though I became aware of it years ago.直到现在我才能够迅速醒觉自己在这么做Only now I catch myself doing it much promptly.极小化的第一个概念是So the first idea of minimizing isKaren Reivich称之为“隧道视野”what Karen Reivich calls tunnel vision.比如 我的课堂里有620个学生For example,let's say I have 620 students in my class.620个中618个在看教材And out of these 620 students 618 are engaged in the material.一个在看天花板 在看灯One is looking at the ceiling,at the lights.620个中的另外一个在睡觉And another one,out of the 620 students,is asleep.隧道视野指的是当我关注那个睡觉的人Tunnel Vision is when I focus on that one person who is asleep.对自己说And I say to myself,“我的课肯定讲得让人无聊 犯困”" Wow,I'm giving boring,sleep inducing lectures."或反过来 620个学生中618个睡着Or the other way around: I have 620 students,618 are asleep.一个在开小差 一个听得十分入迷One is looking around. And one is going "wow!"我只关注那个人 我说我是个好讲师and I only focus on that person and I say I'm a great lecturer.我非常受鼓舞I'm so inspiring.然而不管怎样这都是不现实的Again,it's unrealistic. One way or the other. And认知疗法把现实主义引入这个等式what cognitive therapy does is bring realism into the equation.我也经常因此而困扰Again this is something I often fall into.我最近刚遇到这个情况And just recently I fell into this. And it happened...你们许多人看过Jon Stewart脱口秀I know many of you saw the Jon Stewart show.在Jon Stewart脱口秀中 他讲得太快So what happened in the Jon Stewart show...he was so fast,对我而言超级快 我感觉就像落后了两拍way too fast for me...I felt like I was 2 questions behind还在深思和考虑着两个之前的问题still contemplating and thinking and saying“这会是个很有趣的研究”"well,this could be interesting research."而Jon已经领先了10步And Jon was...he was already 10 steps ahead.我落后了 感觉很迟钝So I fell behind and I felt slow.我也说了些后来让自己后悔的话And I also said something that I later regretted.只是一句话It was just one sentence.没什么大不了的 但我专注在这上面No big deal. But that is what I focus on.我后来飞回家 飞回以色列You know I flew home after. I went back to Israel.在飞机上我一直在想这事The whole flight that what I was thinking of.忽略了其他的事情Ignoring the other things.Jon Stewart脱口秀完了后二小时You know the fact that 2 hours after the Jon Stewart show,这本书成了最畅销书 我完全忽略了这个the book became a best seller. Completely ignore that.我根本没去考虑那Didn't exist as far as I was concerned.我一直在想那句话 我怎么会说出来的?It was just that one sentence. How could I say it?为什么没有更好的准备? 等等Why didn't I prepare for it better? And so on.然后我突然说"等一下" 隧道视野And then I suddenly said," Hey,wait a minute!" Tunnel Vision.我把它缩小了 我把视野扩大And I zoomed out. I looked at the bigger picture.然后我说”我说了一句让我后悔的话 超赞啊”Then I said,"okay,so I said something that I regret. Big deal."这是喜剧 很有趣 许多人在看You know. It's comedy. It's fun. So many people,你的许多朋友都看过 都很喜欢so many of your friends have watched and enjoyed it.这是个很好的机会 我看到了更大的方面It was a great opportunity. I looked at the bigger picture.允许自己做回一个人Gave myself the permission to be human.会感到后悔 但从总体上To regret it.But then overall,我能用比以前更理性的目光看待它I could see it in a much more rational light than before.像我说的 我仍然在用这些想法Big dealSo again,as I said,I still apply...I still use these ideas.过去In the past,我可能要花几个月才不会想这句话it would take me months to get over this one sentence.但是现在 视野变窄 评估想法 非理性的影响Whereas now,zoom out. Evaluation thought,irrational.632能更迅速地恢复And recover much more promptly.消除积极或者消极的影响Dismissal of positives or negatives. So the person有隧道视野的人不会去留意其他618个who has tunnel vision doesn't see the other 618 people专心听课或睡觉的人who are engaged or asleep.忽视了积极面的人看到那些The person who dismiss the positives see those但说他们不重要 它们很微不足道but says they're unimportant; they are trivial in comparison to比起我的失败或我做的错事 比如how I just failed or what I just did wrong. So for example,我经常会遇到的一个困境and this again,something that I...a trap that I often fall into.我大四时申请了奖学金When I was a senior,I applied for fellowships我得到去剑桥的奖学金and I got a fellowship to go to Cambridge.我得的是John Elliot奖学金And I got the John Elliot Fellowship.剑桥有四个奖学金And there are 4 fellowships that go to Cambridge:John Elliot和Fiske 还有Pembrokethe John Elliot,the Fiske,um...one other...Pembroke;还有一个是John Harvard奖学金then there is the John Harvard fellowship.我得到了John Elliot奖学金 四个之一So I got the John Elliot,one of the 4.我得到后不久 我就得到消息了Immediately when I got it,I know that I got it obviously.并不是我无视了它It wasn't that I was ignoring it.但我想为什么没能得到John Harvard奖学金But then I said why didn't I get the John Harvard fellowship.它们之间除名字不同外没任何区别Now there is no difference between them except for the names.但那是我的脑袋里立刻想到的But that's immediately what my mind went to. And that,对我而言是很重要的经历 因为我说that was very important experience for me because I said“看看你” 我在那个时候开始意识到"wow,look at you. "and that's when I started to recognize我们的评估的重要性和威力the importance and the power of our evaluation.它是怎样决定或甚至毁掉And how that can determine or even ruin本该是一件值得庆祝的事what should have been a celebration.但一旦我们认识它 一旦了解它后But once we recognize it,once we understand it,我们可以怀疑它 可以质疑它we can dispute it. We can challenge it.可以重组它 也能看到积极的一面We can reframe it and see the positive as well.此外 认知疗法就是要我们实际点Again,all it's saying in cognitive therapy is let's be real.第三个M是虚构 或称捏造Making up or fabricating the 3rd M.这是我们无中生有的时候This is when we create something ex nihilo,from nothing.比如 我们个人化或者归咎他人So for example,we personalize it or we blame.被虐待的人身上经常能看到这点We see this very often with people who are abused.受虐待的妻子经常会说So an abused wife will very often say“是我做的 我的错 我做的不对”"It's my doing. It's my fault. I'm not behaving appropriately."而不是理智地说Instead of rationally saying“这个家伙虐待我 我要离开”"This guy is abusive. I'm out of here."那是不理性地个人化That's irrational personalization.它也会有别的方式It can also be the other way around.我有次考试成绩很差You know,I just did poorly on an exam我因此责怪我男朋友或女朋友and I blame my boyfriend or girlfriend for it.那也是不现实的 我得承担责任That's also unrealistic. I need to take responsibility.要记住Nathaniel Branden的例子 没有人会来You got to remember Nathaniel Branden. No one is coming.承担起责任而不是责备别人Take responsibility rather than blame.Marva Collins和她的学生交流的One of the key ideas (that)重要的观点之一Marva Collins communicates to her students.不是过度个人化So again,it's not going to the personalizing...over-personalizing或过度责备 而是面对现实or over-blaming,it's being real.最后是情感的推理And finally,emotional reasoning.我满怀妒嫉 因此我肯定是个坏人I am envious; therefore I must be a bad person.或我在试镜前Or I'm experiencing danger遇到了危险 所以肯定很危险before a tryout therefore it must be dangerous.选取一种情绪 让它成为现实Taking an emotion and making it into reality00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:36,550而不是把情感只当做情感whereas instead of understanding an emotion is an emotion,不必符合现实it doesn't necessary capture reality,而是我对现实的评估it is my evaluation of reality.或者 我非常害怕失败 因此Or,I'm extremely scared of failing...and therefore...意味着失败是很危险的it means that failing it's really dangerous,实际不是的 我会马上回到这个话题while in fact it's not. I'll get back up again very quickly,所以要有正确的评估so it's having the correct evaluation,更正轨迹 更正这些错误correcting for the track,correcting for these errors.更正"我很平庸Or feeling that,心理学或数学我学不好"之类的想法I'm second-rate and I'm no good in psychology or maths,因为我有那种感觉 我的评估就是and because I feel that,my evaluation of it is,well,我肯定真的很平庸 学不好I must really be second-rate and no good,而不是理性的想法 让我试一下instead having the rational belief of,well,let me try out,看看事情会怎么样 更正扭曲的想法let me see how things go,correcting the distortions.再说一次 关键是真实化The key,once again,is to get real.我们如何通过我们的提问变真实?How do we get real through the questions that we ask?我在这要给你们举几个例子I am going to give you just a few examples here;你们要自己去练习you are going to practice with those on your own.这些是其中几个But here are just some of them.首先 我的结论和现实相关吗?First of all,is my conclusion tied to reality?第二 那合理吗? 它们是相关联的Second,is it rational? They are interconnected.我忽略了什么重要的事吗?Am I ignoring something important?比如 之后那本书销量很好Like the fact that---you know the book did well afterwards---比如1504教室还有别的男孩 等等like the fact that there are other cool guys in 1504,and so on.什么重要的迹象What important evidence是我需要考虑的?do I still need to take into consideration?进行辩论 举出证据 现实化This is about disputing,it's evidence,it's get real.但小心别只是进行几何形状的扩大Look out,don't just zoom in on the geometric shapes,公交车上还有孩子there are also children on the bus.这是这些问题做的 让我们放开思绪And this is what questions do. They open us up,它们打开我们的视野 创造现实they open our vision and they create in your reality.我夸大了什么?我在贬低什么?What am I magnifying? What am I minimizing?我陷入困境了吗?Am I falling into the traps?我忽略了什么进展很顺利的事吗?Am I ignoring anything that is going well?我忽略什么进展不顺的事吗?Am I ignoring anything that is not going well?这不是不计代价地盲目乐观It's not about Pollyanna feel good at all costs,是要联系现实 最终缩小范围it's about being tied to reality. And finally,let me zoom out.大的画面是什么What is the big picture.结论是 Ed Diener和Martin SeligmanTo conclude,Ed Diener and Martin Seligman对幸福无比的人们做了重要研究did very important research on extremely happy people.这是对高端的研究This is tip of the stamp research.看那些百分之十最幸福的人Looking at the 10 per cent of the happiest people out there,我们能从他们那里取经people that we can learn from.他们的研究结果很有趣And what they found was very interesting.首先 这些人经历痛苦First of all,these people did not experience painful emotions不比其他人少any less times than the rest of the people,比如最不幸福的10%或中间的10%say the bottom 10 per cent or the mid 10 per cent.他们经历过痛苦They experience painful emotions,他们与剩下的人之间的区别是the difference between them and the rest was that they recovered由于不同的诠释 他们恢复得更迅速more promptly as a result of different interpretations.所以他们沮丧时 他们很乐观 不说So when they felt down,they were optimistic instead of saying“这个月剩下的日子我都会沮丧”"ok,so I'm going to feel down for the rest of the month",他们说“我很沮丧 没什么大不了”they said "ok,so I'm feeling down,big deal.我能从中学到什么?发生了什么?What can I learn from it? What happen?我怎样让自己感觉好点?How can I make myself feel better?"然后他们比悲观者恢复得更快And then they recovered more promptly than the pessimists,悲观者会沮丧很长一段时间the people who remained depressed for a much longer time.事件发生 世上有很多事发生You see,events happen,things happen in the world,经常不受我们的控制very often out of our control.我们不能创造所有遇到的事物We don't create everything that we encounter.有些事件是不好的 有些是消极的And some of the events are bad,some are negative.更重要的是我们之后怎样对待它们What matters more is what we do with them after,怎样评估它们 事实上how we evaluate them. And what happens is that我们的评估成了自我实现预言our evaluation becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy,因为悲观者会说"我现在心情不好because a pessimist will say "I'm in a bad mood now,会持续很长时间it's going to last for a very long time,不会消失" 而乐观者会说it's not going to go away",whereas an optimist says"这是暂时的 会消失的""it's temporary,it's going to go away"并相信我们的自我实现预言and believes our self-fulfilling prophecies.如果我认为它会持续六个月If I believe that it will last for six months,它更有可能 不一定it's much more likely,not necessarily,但更可能持续六个月but it's much more likely to last for six months比我说“那也会过去的”than if I say "that too shall pass".我们对待信仰的方式And what we do with our beliefs是造一个向下的忧伤沮丧的螺旋is we create a downward spiral of depression,unhappiness,或一个向上的拥有积极情绪的螺旋sadness or an upward spiral,capitalizing positive emotions并越来越多and having more and more of them,Barbara Fredrickson所说的what Barbara Fredrickson talks about“扩大和构造”现象大部分取决于我们自身the "broaden and build" phenomenon. A lot of it is up to us.没有捷径 通往幸福 成功There are no short cuts. There are no easy steps to wellbeing,和自身更高水平的信念的道路并不容易to success,to high level of beliefs in ourselves.那需要付出和努力 无论是形象化It takes work,it takes effort,whether it's work visualizing,还是努力奋斗和积极面对whether it's hard work and coping,或是学习如何消除非理性思想or whether it's work learning to dispute irrational thoughts.并不是弄明白一次And it's not enough to just understand it once然后就一劳永逸and then we are all set,我们一生都必须持续努力we are all inoculated for the rest of our lives.如果你想继续努力If you want to continue working,我们必须一直致力其中we have to continue working at it.下个内容 讲"关注"的问题Let me move on...And talk about the question of "focus".因为我们关注某一要素Because just like if we focus on specific element或事件与否 有很大的区别of an event or not makes a difference,它对我们整个生命的宏观层面有巨大影响it applies on the macro level to our entire life.我现在要进行详细的阐述What I am going to do now is elaborate,对一些我们经常讨论的go up higher level of the spiral of understanding and learning,关于某事的理解和学习螺旋进行更高层次分析of something that we have talked about time and again.Ed Diener 我刚提到他的研究Ed Diener,who is also,I just mentioned his research,他也是国际积极心理学协会的he is also the president,first president第一任会长of the International Positive Psychology Association,他来自伊利诺州 经过多年研究 他发现he's from Illinois. After years of research,concludes,对幸福而言 人们感知世界的方式it appears that the way people perceive the world比客观环境更重要is much more important to happiness than objective circumstances.如果你想一下的话 很有道理Now if you think about it,that makes a lot of sense.我们认识许多看起来拥有一切的人We know a lot of people who seemingly have everything,无论是财富 或很好的朋友或家人whether it's wealth,whether it's wonderful friends and family,他们的梦想都已成真 但仍很痛苦all their dreams have come true,and they are still miserable.而有些人拥有的很少While there are people who have very little,经历了一次次困境who have experienced hardship after hardship而从没停止为生活感到欢庆 还有些人and who never cease to celebrate life. Then there are people他们拥有一切并很感激这一切who have everything going for them and really appreciate it,不觉得理所当然 他们很快乐 有些人don't take it for granted and are happy. And there are people拥有的不多 永远都在抱怨who don't have much and never cease to complain.换句话说 不只是内在的...抱歉In other words,it's not just the internal or...sorry,重要的不只是外在it's not just the external that matters,更重要的是内在what matters more is the internal.幸福不是取决于我们的处境Happiness is not contingent on our status,或我们银行账户里的金额or the state of our bank account,更依赖于我们的思想状态it's much more dependent on our state of mind,依赖于我们选择关注什么on what we choose to focus on.因为我们的感情Because our emotions are determined由外部和内部状况一起决定by external circumstances as well as internal,如何去诠释很重要 比如interpretation matters. For example,看爱迪生如何对待5000次的失败look at what Edison did,5,000 failures to the external observer,对他而言 评估和常人不同for him the evaluation was very different.内部评估 主观的评估The internal evaluation,the subjective evaluation,我证明了5000种方法不管用it was 5,000 times where I showed what doesn't work.要关注什么由我们自己决定And it's up to us to decide where we focus.我们庆祝成功或视为理所当然?Do we celebrate successes or take it for granted?我们觉得失败和困难都是灾难Do we perceive failures and hardships as a disaster或是成长的机会? 爱默生说过or as an opportunity for growth? Emerson:“对不同思想而言 世界既是天堂又是地狱”"to different minds the same world is a hell and a heaven."莎士比亚说过And Shakespeare:“事情没有好坏之分 只是思想使然”"Nothing is good or bad,but thinking makes it so."我不是百分之一百同意莎士比亚Now,I don't 100 per cent agree with Shakespeare,但从很大程度上看他是对的 住在达尔富尔的人but he is to a great extent right. A person in ???就像生活在地狱中 很难改变环境is living in hell,and it's very difficult to reframe,并在那样的处境中表现得积极乐观and to derive,and to look at the positive in that situation.822对住在集中营的人也一样Same for a person living in a concentration camp.所以有的外部情况会有影响So there are external circumstances that matter.一个人 无家可归的人A person,a homeless person,you know,如果给他们足够的钱买房子 买食物if you give them enough money for a home,for food,接受基础的教育 他们当然会更快乐for basic education,of course they will become happier827因为外部情况的改变because of the change of external circumstances.然而 在基本需要和基本的自由外However,beyond the basic needs,beyond the basic freedoms,主要和我们如何认知现实有关it is mostly about how we perceive reality,以及我们如何让生活变成天堂或地狱and we are able to make it into a heaven or a hell.我们做个练习Let's do an exercise来帮助我们理解"专注创造现实"这一观点that will capture this idea of "focus creating reality".我有个问题问你们 有多少几何图形?So I have a question for you: how many geometric shapes?不幸 这个很棒的练习 只能做一次Unfortunate,it's a great exercise but it only works once.记住这点 你如何创造现实Remember this,how you created your reality基于你提的问题just based on the question that you asked.当我们看这幅图时我们在思考We think when we look at the picture,当然不是每个人都在看那个you know not everyone of course is looking on the children时钟上的公共汽车上的那个小孩 对吗?on the bus on the clock,right?但它就在你面前 而你没看到But before it was right in front of you and you didn't,你们许多人没有看到这点 是专注的问题most of you,did not see it,because it is a question of focus.我们经常抱怨生活 我们认为Very often we complain about life and we think,事情很糟糕 很可怕 而没意识到you know,things are terrible and awful not realizing我们是它的起因 要么是在想象它时that we're the cause of it,either by imaging it然后我们的信念变成自我实现预言and then beliefs become self-fulfilling prophesies,或因为我们只专注于不对的方面or,because we just focus on what is not working.而这并不意味着And one thing and this does not mean没有什么客观的糟糕的情况that there are no objective terrible circumstances out there.但很大程度上 我们一起创造了现实But to a great extent,a great extent,we co-create our reality.我的一个学生You know one of the students两年前在1504教室 向我推荐这本书who was in 1504 two years ago recommended this book to me---《深夜加油站遇见苏格拉底》是本好书Way of the Peaceful Warrior. And it's a wonderful book,我刚开始看 它有部同名电影 对的I just started reading it...and there is a movie on it,right...我昨天才开始看 我看到这个...I just started reading it yesterday,and I came across this...这个寓言很巧合 我想读给你们听you know coincidentally this parable,so I want to read it to you作者Dan Millman讲了一个故事The story that Dan Millman,the author,tells:我和他在中东一个建筑工地认识I met him on a construction site in the Middle West.当午餐哨吹响时When the lunch whistle blew,所有的工人都会坐在一起吃饭all the workers would sit down together to eat.每天Sam都会打开午餐桶 开始抱怨And everyday Sam would open his lunch pail and start to complain."该死的家伙"他会大叫"Son of the gun,"he would cry,"又是花生酱和果冻三明治"not peanut butter and jelly sandwich again!我讨厌花生酱和果冻"I hate peanut butter and jelly!"他埋怨着花生酱和果冻He whined about his peanut butter and jelly sandwiches日复一日day after day after day,直到一天工作组里的一个人终于说until one of the guys in the work crew finally said:"Sam 如果你这么讨厌花生酱和果冻"Sam,if you hate peanut butter and jelly so much,为什么不叫你老婆why don't you just tell your old lady给你做点别的?"to make you something different?""什么我老婆?"Sam回答说"What do you mean my old lady?" Sam replied,"我没结婚 我自己做三明治""I'm not married,I make my own sandwiches."我们经常自己做三明治You know,very often we make our own sandwiches而没意识到这点 因为我们问的问题and we don't even notice it. Because the questions that we ask,我们问的问题决定我们的现实the questions that we ask determine our reality:花生三明治 几何形状 或车上的孩子a peanut sandwich,or geometric shapes,or children on the bus,或香肠 无论什么 我们创造我们自己的现实or salami,whatever it is. We very often create our own reality.如果我们理解这点 我们能改变And if we understand this,we can transform,改变我们认知的方式 改变关注的事change the way that we perceive,change our focus,改变我们的问题change our questions,无论是辩论非理性评估whether it's questions disputing irrational evaluations,或是关注积极面whether it's questions focusing on the positive,还是创造新的现实的问题and questions create a new reality.我们将在这里讨论There are essentially two archetypes本质上来说有两种原型that I would like to discuss here,在如何认知性地重建 加强 创造现实等two archetypes that capture in many ways多种途径有着两种原型how we can cognitively reconstruct,enhance,create our reality.两个原型分别是积极者和消极者The two archetypes are the benefit-finder and the fault-finder.首先消极者 消极者是First of all,the fault-finder,the fault-finder is a person总是专注不成功的事情的人who always focuses on things that don't work,花生酱和果冻 专注进展不顺利的事on the peanut butter and jelly,on things that are not going well专注交往中的问题 他或她自己的问题on problems in the relationship,on problem in him or herself,工作的问题 总是爱抱怨的人problems with the job---the consummate complainer.我们都存在于消极和Now,we all exist on the continuum of积极两个极端之间between extreme fault-finding and extreme benefit-finding.没有人You know there is no one总处于某一个极端who is all the way on the extreme this way or that way,每个人都在这个集合当中的某处everyone is on somewhere on the continuum.我想要鼓励的是 从消极向积极的方向What I'm going to argue for is to move a little bit more逐渐移动from the fault-finding toward the benefit-finding,因为这样有很多好处 我等下会讲到because there are many benefits to it that I'll discuss later.消极者The fault-finder,这名字出自梭罗的书中I got the name from the work of Henry David Thoreau,消极者甚至在天堂都能找到缺陷the fault-finder will find faults even in paradise.极端消极者总会经历辞职The extreme fault-finder experiences resignation,感到无助感 为什么?learned helplessness. Why?因为他或她开始真的相信Because he or she begins to really believe糟糕的现实真的存在that the terrible reality is very much out there independent of不受他或她的想法支配what he or she thinks,而没意识到是他们创造了那个现实not recognizing that they create that reality,他们开始相信无论他们做什么they begin to believe that no matter what they do,无论找什么工作 总有个糟糕的老板no matter what job they find they have a terrible boss,无论和什么人搭档no matter what partners they have他们都很糟糕 不顾及别人they are always awful and inconsiderate,无论去什么饭店 服务总是很糟糕no matter what restaurant they go to the service is always awful,他们总是吃同样的花生酱and they always keep on getting the same peanut butter和果冻三明治 是他们自己做的and jelly sandwich that they made for themselves.他们向现实屈服And they resigned to the reality那同时当然也让他们的存在and that becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy of course,变成自我实现预言their existence.消极者用柠檬榨柠檬汁A fault-finder makes lemonade out of lemons,抱歉 用柠檬汁做柠檬sorry,makes lemon out of lemonade.而积极者 加大洛杉矶分校的Julian Bauer做的研究The benefit-finder,research Julian Bauer,now at UCLA,积极者相反 专注于成功的事物the benefit-finder is the opposite,focuses on what works.积极者专注生活的光明一面The benefit-finder looks on the bright side of life,00:56:04,610 --> 00:56:09,290在乌云笼罩中找到一丝白光finds the silver lining in the dark cloud,用柠檬榨柠檬汁makes lemonade out of lemons,积极者能在普通中找到奇迹The benefit-finder finds the miracle in the common,爱默生就是一个模范积极者Ralph Waldo Emerson,the consummate benefit-finder,专注于积极面和进展顺利的事上focusing on the positive and what works.这里的问题也许是Now the problem here may be that积极者也许会孤立地...the benefit-finder may be detached,这是人们经常看到的一种批评this is one of the criticisms of people who always see,只看到生活的光明面you know,the bright side of life,这样的话的确是一个问题and that is the problem if that is the case. Again,这节课不提倡只专注积极面this class is not advocating focusing only on the positive;它专注于提倡现实its focus is advocating reality.现实包含好的和坏的食物And reality comprises both good and bad,现实包含几何图形reality comprises both geometric shapes和车上的孩子 关键在于要同时关注两者and children on the bus,and the key is to focus on both.分离So the detachment,分离地看待事物的积极者 不是一个原型the detached benefit-finder is certainly not an archetype在长期条件下that I would advocate nor would it lead to mental health它当然也不会使人心理健康in the long run.Nathaniel Branden说过"There is a need in the world" ---of Nathaniel Branden---“世界上需要尊重现实”"to respect reality."我们不能只凭专注创造现实We don't create reality simply by the focus,我们是共同创造者however,we are co-creator.我给你们读一段William James的话Let me read you extensively from William James,"但这些实在的因素 虽然都非常固定"Now however fixed these elements of reality may be,而我们对付它们 还是有一定自由的we still have a certain freedom in our dealings with them.拿感觉来说Take our sensations,感觉的存在 我们虽不能控制THAT they are is undoubtedly beyond our control;但是在我们的结论里 我们注意哪个but WHICH we attend to,note,and着重哪个 毕竟得凭我们个人的利益来决定make emphatic in our conclusions depends on our own interests;着重之点不同and,according as we lay the emphasis here or there,结果构成的真理可完全不同quite different formulations of truth result.事实全同 我们的看法可各异We read the same facts differently.同一个滑铁卢之战 具体情节绝无二致'Waterloo',with the same fixed details,而英国人看来是"胜利"spells a 'victory' for an Englishman;法国人看来是"失败"for a Frenchman it spells 'defeat'.同样 宇宙也如此 乐观主义者看作是胜利So,for an optimist philosopher the universe spells victory,悲观主义者看作是失败 我们对现实抱有怎样说法for a pessimist,defeat. What we say about reality thus全看我们怎么给他配景"depends on the perspective into which we throw it. "这是William James在1890年说的William James said these back in 1890,理解我们如何共同创造现实understanding how we co-create our reality.这是我最喜欢的R.L. Sharpe的诗Here is one of my...one of my favorite poems by R.L. Sharpe:"是不是很奇怪 王子和国王Isn't it strange,how princes and kings,在木屑圈裡跳來跳去的小丑and clowns that caper in sawdust rings,一如你我的凡人and common-people like you and me,怎么会是永恒的打造者?are builders for eternity?人人都拿到了一份规则表each is given a list of rules,一大块不成形的东西 一袋工具a shapeless mass and a bag of tools;在生命流逝之前 人人都必须雕出and each must fashion your life is flown,一块绊脚石 或是一块垫脚石“a stumbling block or a stepping stone.经常我们在开始得到的东西Very often what we get in the beginning是一大块石头 我们怎么办?is a large piece of stone. What do we do with it?我们把它凿成漂亮的"大卫"?Do we create it into a beautiful "David"?凿碎多余的石头?Chipping away the excess stone?或者它只是我们通往成功的障碍Or,is it a barrier to our success?通常这是由我们决定的 因为我们共创现实And very often it is up to us,as we co-create our reality.石头就在那 我们不用负责The stone is there,we are not responsible for it;但我们用它做什么 我们要负责but what we do with it,we are responsible for.认知重建Cognitive reconstruction是要学习乐观地诠释事情is about learning to interpret things optimistically,换句话说 要积极的肯定值得肯定之处another words,in the positive light.Ann Harbison 我同事Ann Harbison,colleague of mine,以前也和Philip Stone一起教书used to teach also with Philip Stone,说过“永远不要浪费一次好的危机”said that "never let a good crisis go to waste".危机在发展中有潜力Crises have the potential through growth.我们将谈到的其中一本书One of the books that we will talk about《热情婚姻》是关于婚姻关系的when we talk about relationships is Passionate Marriage作者David Schnarch 谈论婚姻中的考验by David Schnarch,who talks about crucibles in marriage.他说 成功的婚姻And what he says is that ...the thriving relationships,婚姻关系不是一直a relationships,not that have been,you know,和睦融洽的 往往会有争吵all fine and dandy for years. These usually fail after a while.而是经历过磨难But the relationships that go through crucibles,有过危机 有过分歧的婚姻关系that have crises,disagreements and then,you know,就像黑格尔的否定之否定规律Thesis and Antithesis and then there is a Synthesis,往往会因为经历过这些困难而获得更好的发展and there is a growth as a result of these hardships.他说没有其他办法And he says that there is no other way,学习失败或在失败中学习again learn to fail or fail to learn,维持长期的关系必须靠这个方法there is no other way for a long-term success of a relationship.关系看起来不像这样Relationship does not,cannot look like this.它必须有起有落It has to have these ups and downs.从不错失关系中的一个好危机Never let a good crisis in a relationship go to waste.不是说每个危机都要解决That doesn't mean that every crisis needs to be resolved有些关系可以结束 也应该结束and there are some that could end,and should end a relationship.但多数危机能被解决 需要处理好But most crises can be solved and need to be dealt with.在个人层面也是一样 Warren Bennis的研究表明Same on individual level,work by Warren Bennis,他来自南加州大学he is from USC,在这里的商学院执教过几年taught for a few years here at the Business School,他鉴定了一群领袖人物has identified the leading leaders,无论是他称为“极客”的年轻一代whether it's younger ones what he called,或者是30多岁或更大的whom he called "the geeks",the thirty-year-olds,or elder ones,他称之为“怪杰”的老一辈"the geezers" he called them.他出过一本叫《极客与怪杰》的书He has a book called Geeks & Geezers,他在里面讨论了where he talks about the differences这两种领导风格 领导方式 激情以及between the two leadership styles,approaches,passions,兴趣爱好的区别 有许多的不同之处interests and there are numerous differences.比如For example,you know,极客 年轻一代会谈论工作生活平衡the geeks---the younger one talk about work-life balance,怪杰们则不知道那是什么意思the geezers don't know what he means by that.而男人工作You know it was usually,he,a man,女人照顾家庭和男人worked while the woman took care of the family and the man.则是对怪杰而言的 对老的一代而言So that was for the geezers,for the older generation.年轻的一代 谈论工作生活平衡The younger generation,they talk about work-life balance他们如何结合生活中所有的元素and how they can incorporate all the elements of their lives.当然在极客中的女人数比怪杰中多There are of course many more women in the geeks than the geezers两代人有无数不同点 但有一个相似点Numerous differences among the generation,one similarity.所有的伟大的领袖All the great leaders,无论是30岁或85岁whether they were thirty-year-old or eighty-five years old,他们都经历过艰难的困境all of them had been through very rough crucibles留下一段充满惊险的往事and leave to tell the tale.我们大多数人经历过困境Our most people go through crucibles,但有些人but there are certain people能从这些困境中找到益处who are able to find benefit in these crucibles从而成长and grow as a results.永远不要错失一个好危机Never let a good crisis go to waste,无论你在经历的是whether it's professionally,whether it's interpersonally,职业上或人际关系上whether it's intra-personally in terms of或是内在个性上的危机what you are experiencing.四年或五年前But four years ago or five years ago,我还是Leverett宿舍的住宿导师when I was still a resident tutor in Leverett house,我们举办了开学前活动and we had one of these pre-business events我们讨论了即将来临的一年的情况where we talked about the upcoming year和招聘事宜等等and the recruiting and so on.那一年是很糟糕的一年That particular year was a terrible year,高盛在裁员 没有校园招聘Goldman Sachs was laying off,wasn't recruiting on campus,瑞士信贷 第一波士顿银行也在裁员Credit Suisse,First Boston they were laying off as well,德意志银行建行以来第一次裁员Deutsche Bank,first time in his history was laying off employees市场环境非常糟糕 我们讨论时每个人really bad market. And we talked about this,each of us gave it,都在估测市场的形势和他们能做什么what should be about the market and what they can do,非常严肃的话题 然后一个学生very sober presentation. And then one of the students,我的学生Sean Fieldscoy当时大四you know my students Sean Fieldscoy,was a senior then,他坐在那里 他学了积极心理学was sitting there,Had studied positive psychology there.他举起手说He put up his hand and said:"Tal 你描绘了一个非常悲观的"Tal,you know,as...you know you portrait a very pessimistic消极的画面and negative picture,但作为一个积极心理学老师but as a teacher of Positive Psychology你能否说点积极的?"can you maybe shed some optimism here?" And you know,观众中有些窃笑 然后是一片寂静few chuckles in the audience and then silence.每个人都看着我And everyone is looking at me,我不知道说什么 我第一反应是说I don't know what to say and my immediate reaction was to say“Sean 事出皆有因” 没错"Well Sean things happen for the best." Exactly. (laughs)然后And then,当我说出口前 我心想just before it came out of my mouth I said...I thought to myself,"其实我不相信""Actually I don't believe that."我不相信事出皆有因I don't believe that things happen for the best.但虽然我不相信事出皆有因But while I don't believe that things happen for the best,我的确相信有些人能够因事制宜I do believe that some people are able to make the best这里有一个很大的区别of things that happen,and there is a very big difference here.因为当我说“我不满意刚发生的事”Because when I say "I'm not happy about what just happen here,我不喜欢它 我更希望市场是好市场I don't like it,I much rather have the market be a good market,人们就业很容易where people are hiring,许多人争相向我提供工作where they all come to me on a silver platter and offer me a job.当然 我更情愿那样Of course,I would much rather have that.所以事出未必有因So things don't happen for the best necessarily,但有些人接受这种情况but there are some people who accept the situation并且能够因事制宜and then are able to make the best of it.对任何危机而言都一样 你们以为领袖们The same with any crisis. Do you think the leaders,无论他们80或90岁whether they are the eighty- or ninety-year-olds,会主动在生活中寻求严酷的考验吗invited those crucibles into their lives会想让这些困难发生吗?want these crucibles to happen?你觉得处在关系中的伙伴会说Do you think partners go into a relationship and say"我们寻找考验"let's look for that crucible,我们吵一架让我们的关系更健康吧"?let's really fight so that we can have a healthy relationship"?当然不会 但如果真的发生这种情况Of course not! But when it happens,他们会充分利用它that's when they make the best of it.有些事会发生You know,stuff happens,我们要么无动于衷要么从中获取利益and we can either let it pollute or make fertilizer out of it.我再举一个领袖的例子I want to show you an example once again of a leader,他是一个模范积极者who is a consummate benefit-finder.我们很荣幸能和曼德拉聊天Wow. We are honored to be talking with Neilson Mandela,南非前任总统 他不可动摇的勇气the former president of South Africa,whose unshakable courage,他的信仰和正直鼓舞了数千万人his faith and integrity have inspired millions to see看到自己生命中的可能what is possible in their own lives.我很高兴 很荣幸在此之前几次见过I've had the pleasure,the honor of meeting Mr. Mandela曼德拉先生 我告诉你们on a couple of occasions before and I will tell you,和他在一起真的 和你在一起to be in his presence is really,to be in your presence01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:24,470就像同时和庄严和优雅在一起is like being a presence of royalty and grace at the same time.我想知道一个人在狱中度过27年I would think,I wonder how does a man spend 27 years in prison,被压迫者迫害入狱put there by an oppressor,出来后没有铁石心肠and come out of that experience with not a heart of stone,没有漠不关心not a cold heart而怀着愿意原谅和容纳的心but a heart that is willing to forgive and embrace.我记得一晚吃晚饭时和你聊天I remember talking to you one night of our dinner,你对我说 我们对压制者的憎恨and you had said to me that our hatred for the oppressor太过强烈 我们没有看到和他谈话的价值was so intense we did not see the value of talking to him.那么你看到了什么价值 要放下仇恨So at what point did you see the value of letting go of that hatred并开展对话?and begin the process of talking?首先我想说 这是一个很好的策略Well,let me say first,that is a great tragedy把一生最好的时间花监狱中to spend the best of your lives in prison.虽然看起来很讽刺 但有好处But although it looks ironical,there are advantages in that.如果我没有入狱 不会有...If I had not been at the prison,I have not...我不会完成毕生中I would not be able to achieve the most difficult,最困难的任务 那改变了你自己a task in life,and that is changing yourself.我不会有那样的机会I would not have an opportunity.我有那个机会是因为 在监狱里你有I had that opportunity because in prison you have在监狱外工作所没有的what we don't have in our work outside prison,机会 可以坐下思考 这是重要部分the opportunity to sit down and think,which is an important part但你需要27年吗?Did you need 27 years of it though?你可以用几天 几周 一个假期You could have taken a few days,a week,a vacation.你需要27年吗?Did you need 27 years?好Now,他花了27年是有意义的吗?did it happen for the best that he spent 27 years of his life?当然他经历时 很痛苦 很可怕Certainly when he experienced it,it was painful,it was awful,但他能改变这个but he was able to transform this.甚至在那个情况下 看到积极方面And to,even in that situation,to see the positive.当我们改变那个And when we transform that,那些知道他经历过什么事的人those who know the history of what happen to him,当他开始看这积极方面when he started to look at the positive,即使在监狱也有机会even there are the opportunities in prison当他改变思维模式 换句话说when he changes his mind set. In other words,不是外部情况not the external circumstances,外部情况确实开始改变the external circumstances actually begin to change.另一个积极者Another benefit-finder,"悲观者在每个机会中看到困难"a pessimist sees difficulty in every opportunity,乐观者在每个困难中看到机会"an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty."你不会想跟他争论And you don't want to argue with him.我想在结尾给你讲一个故事I want to end by telling you a story,一个关于我几年间经历的个人故事a personal story about my experiences throughout the years.一些自传细节Some biographical detail,一些你们多数人不知道的事something that most of you did not know.我要告诉你们And I am going to tell it to you first先从消极者的角度from the perspective of the fault-finder.我有轻微的注意力缺陷障碍I have a mild case of ADD,这让事情变得非常困难it makes things very difficult for me,我很难集中精神 我的脑子经常游离it's difficult for me to focus,my mind wanders often,我真的不断地与它斗争and I really struggle with it constantly.当我读高中时When I was in high school,我很想进入一个数学的赚钱项目中I really wanted to get into a lucrative program in mathematics,没通过入选考试 我很失望did not pass the entry exam,I was very disappointed,我没做到 成了专业壁球运动员I did not make it. Becoming a professional squash player是我11岁以来的梦想was a dream for me since the age of 11.那是我一直会想的事情That is the thing that I thought about constantly,那时这是我最重要的事that was the most important thing for me at the time.我想当一个专业选手I wanna to be a professional player.20岁时At the age of twenty,我在以色列马上就要服满兵役I was about to complete my military service in Israel我在壁球场受了伤and I got injured on the squash court拉坏了背部的肌肉and pulled the muscle in my back.医生让我选择 或者动手术The doctor gave me an option of being operated on,这有很大风险 或者放弃职业生涯which was a big risk,or giving up my professional career.我选择放弃我的职业生涯I chose to give up my professional career,一个我儿时的梦想 这个打击很大a dream that I had from a very young age. It was a real blow.我去了剑桥I went to Cambridge,哈佛毕业后 我参加一个博士项目after graduating from Harvard and I enrolled in a PhD program.我是那个项目中唯一没通过的I was the only student in my PhD program to fail,我被赶出了这个项目 很没面子I was thrown out of the program. It was humiliating;像浪费了一年it seemed like a waste of a year因为我甚至没拿到硕士学位because I did not even get a master's degree.这真的是个很艰难的经历It was a real tough experience.在哈佛 作为研究生At Harvard,as a graduate student,I took,我和其他学生一起 参加资格统考with all the other students,my qualifying general exams.在所有参加那个考试的研究生中Out of all the graduate students who took that exam,我是唯一没有通过的I was the only one who failed it.又是一个非常丢脸的经历Once again,a really humiliating experience,走在William James楼边 大家都知道成绩walking around William James and everyone knows their results,这很难堪 不只那样 我被临时it was tough. Not only that,I was given provisional,临时选择留在这个项目中the provisional option of staying in the program.他们对我说 你不仅要通过明年考试They said to me,not only do you need to pass next year's exam要和下一届一起考when you take it with the next class,你还要出色地通过考试 否则就出局you have to pass it with flying colors or you are out.剩下的这个学期So,while the rest of the semester,忙着于论文和写作的同时while working on the dissertations,writing,我几乎快毕业还得回去看最基本的知识almost graduating I had to go back to the basics把所有教材再复习一遍and go over the whole material again.天啊 我太不幸了God,I am so unlucky.我想说一些我生活中的某些自传性事实I want to share with you some biographical facts about my life,我有轻微注意力缺陷障碍you know,I have a mild case of ADD,这很棒 知道为什么吗?which is great,you know why?因为 这实际迫使我只能学Because,it actually forces me to only study things我喜欢的东西 我关心的东西that I love,things that I care about,因为其他的事情 我就集中不了精神because anything else,my concentration just goes away.所以就像我有一个内部机制So it's like,I have an internal mechanism强迫我专注最终的东西that forces me to focus on the ultimate currency,专注让我快乐的东西on things that make me happy. And我只学我热爱的东西 这很棒I only study things that I'm passionate about,it is wonderful.我读高中时You know,when I was in high school,非常想进某个项目I really wanted to get into a certain program,一个可以赚钱的项目 但没能进去in a very lucrative program,and I didn't get in,我入选考试没通过I failed the entrance exam,这最终是塞翁失马which turned out to be a blessing in disguise,因为它让我有更多时间练习打壁球because it gave me so much more time to practice and play squash,我最终赢得了国际冠军and I ended up winning international championships在第二年in the following year,如果我进了那个项目就不会做到了which I wouldn't have done had I been in that program.当我在剑桥大学时When I was in the University of Cambridge,我在一个博士项目 我是班里唯一I was in a PhD program,and I was the only one in my class,据我所知and as far as I know,数年来唯一被赶出这个项目的人the only one in years to be thrown out of the program.这其实是个很重要的经历And it was actually a very important experience,you know,我哈佛毕业时 很自负I got out of Harvard,I was arrogant,我认为自己比谁都神圣I thought I was holier than thou,这是个非常令人羞辱的经历and this was a real humbling experience对我而言尤其重要that was especially important for me,因为第二年我去亚洲工作because the next year I went to work in Asia,在那里 自负是最糟糕的事情and there,the worst that I could do was to be arrogant.所以这个令人羞辱的经历So this humbling experience actually helped me对我后来的生活有很大帮助a great deal in my future career,也帮助我正确对待事情as well as helped me put things in perspective.当我来到哈佛 我是项目中唯一When I came to Harvard,I was the only one in my program没通过资格统考的人to fail the general qualifying exams,这是沉重的打击 很艰难it was a hard blow,it was difficult,但结果是个很好的经历 知道为什么?but it turned out to be a very good experience,you know why?因为我得把相同的教材Because I had to study the exact same material这些厚厚的书和文章重新学习一遍and these huge books and articles all over again,不只是达到基本水平and know them not just at the basic level,我要学得非常好 因为这是条件I had to know them extremely well because that was the condition是教授让我留在这个项目组的条件that the professors gave for me staying in the program.这非常好 因为我把教材融会贯通And it was so good because I learned the material so well我的社会心理学 现在大概that I know social psychology today probably比我认识的任何人都好 这帮了我很大忙better than anyone I know,and that helps me a great deal.它帮我把这个1504课程整合起来It helps me a great deal in putting together this course 1504,没什么地方比这里更让我喜欢待的and there is no place I would rather be than here.天 我真幸运God,I am so lucky.谢谢 同样的事实 不同的诠释Thank you. Same reality,different interpretations.只要记住 我们经历的大部分事情Just remember,much of what we experience,我们参与创造 下星期见we co-create. See you next week.
