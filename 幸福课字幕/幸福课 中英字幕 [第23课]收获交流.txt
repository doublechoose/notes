Thank you我已经感觉好多了Feel better already这是我在哈佛的最后一节课了So this is for me the last class at Harvard还有谁也是一样Who else is in the same boat?你的最后一节课Wow. Your last class我今天想做的是What I'd like to do today is尽可能地总结一下我们一路来summarize what we've gone through some of the journey所得的一些收获as much as possible我想和你们分享And what I'd like to do is to share that这个总结的责任the responsibility of summarizing你们也要一起分享to share it with you所以我想从你们思考和回忆课程内容开始so I'd like to start with you thinking and reflecting about the course换言之我们今天这节课In other words, we are going to run the class today就像个亲密互动环节like a small intimacy section之后我会讲一遍我认为的Afterwards I'll go through what I think of some of the highlights这学期的一些重点知识main points from the semester我想先从你们开始So I want to start with a time-in给你们机会回顾一下an opportunity for you to reflect我尤其希望你们能够回顾And specifically I would like you to reflect以下主题 并把它们写下来on the following things and actually write them down翻阅一下你们的笔记 搜索一下脑海So go over your notes or go over your mental notes写下至少两样你觉得这学期最有意义and write down at least two things that were particularly meaningful或你觉得最有趣的东西or interesting for you from this semester不管是课上听到的内容whether it's something that you heard in lecture小组讨论时的话题something you discussed in section你阅读时读到的东西something that you read课后你和朋友讨论过的something that you talked about with your friends after class和这门课有所联系的问题and somehow was connected to your experience here什么都可以 至少两样对你来说最有意义anything or at least two things that were personally meaningful或最有趣的东西and interesting to you这是第一个内容So this is the first thing我想让你们写下的第二个内容The second thing that I'd like you to write down你们可能以前试过and you may have done it before可能以前写过You may have written it before至少两样你所决心做的转变at least two commitments that you are making两种行为转变或态度转变two behavioral changes or attitudinal changes两样你要付诸实施的改变two commitments that you are taking upon yourself既然学期也都快结束了now that the semester is almost over再说一遍 至少两样有意义或有趣的事So again, two meaningful or interesting ideas at least以及至少两个转变and at least two commitments不管是建立习惯whether it's in the form of rituals态度转变 或行为转变attitudinal change or behavioral change花一点时间把它们写下来So take just a few minutes to do that in a time-in好OK现在我希望你们做的 当然是完全Now what I'd like you to do - and this is completely voluntary自愿的of course就是分享一些你们学过的is share some of the things that you've learned或至少一样这学期学过的有意义or at least one thing that you learned that was personally meaningful或很有趣的东西or interesting to you from this semester以及如果你们愿意的话and if you feel comfortable那两样转变其中的一样the one of the two commitments或两样一起分享给or both commitments that you've taken upon yourselves你身边的那位同学with the person next to you或你身边的两位同学or with two people next to you花五分钟来彼此分享一下So take just 5 minutes to share with one another一样有趣或有意义的事one interesting or meaningful thing以及一到两种转变and one commitment or two好OK我希望你们在今天或人生中I hope you continue the rest of your day余下的时间还能继续分享学过的知识for the rest of your life sharing what you've learned正在学的知识what you are learning你如何成长how you are growing我现在想做的是Now what I would like to do is听听你们讲讲一样hear some of you just talk about you know one thing你认为它perhaps that you find有趣或有意义的事found interesting or meaningful可以是课堂内容 也可以来自其他涉猎that could be directly from the class or something tangential但却是这学期对你来说有趣或有意义的东西but what was meaningful or interesting for you this semester我们把话筒在整个教室传递And we have some microphones spread around the room有没有人愿意做第一个自愿讲讲的So if anyone would like to be the first one, to volunteer还记得吗 勇气并不是没有畏惧remember courage is not about not having fear而是有了畏惧还坚持向前it's about having fear and going ahead anyway如果勇气是没有畏惧If courage was about not having fear我就不会来教这门课了I would not be teaching this classElizabethElizabeth我觉得对我来说最重要的东西就是I think for me what the most important thing was was the idea自我和谐的目标of self-concordant goal不是浮躁或自私的not being frivolous or selfish而是一种每个人都应该but actually being something that积极追求的 可以帮助你身边的人one should actively pursue and can help the people around you而非别人让你追求什么 你就追求什么more than by pursuing that what you are told to pursue很好 消除自我和他人之间的分歧Great. So essentially dissolving this divide between self and the other还记得吗And remember达赖喇嘛 当他到了西方国家后有多惊讶the Dalai Lama - how surprised he was when he came to the west他听说我们的"同情"这个词and he heard our word for compassion指的是对其他人的同情means essentially compassion toward others而藏语中Sawai既指对他人的同情whereas Sawai in Tibetan means compassion toward others也包括对自我的同情and compassion toward oneself它们是彼此交融的They go hand in hand; they are intertwined所以要找到自我和谐的目标So identifying our self-concordant goals很大程度上就是要帮助自我is very much about helping ourselves并最终使世界变得更美好and ultimately making the world a better place非常好 谢谢你Wonderful. Thank you我觉得Roger Bannister对我来说很有意义I found the Roger Bannister story really meaningful to me尤其因为我现在明白了一切皆有可能especially because now I know nothing is impossible即使科学家说有些事是不可能的even there are scientists telling you things are impossible你也还是可以做到的You can still achieve them对 人们经常会跟说 这是不可能的Right. You know so often people tell us that it's impossible你做不到you can't do it我们的脑海中总是回响着这样的声音And we have that voice at the back of our mind这些狭隘的想法those limiting beliefs这种狭隘既包括对我们的感觉whether it's limiting beliefs about how we can feel也包括我们所能做到的事can feel; and what we can achieve而Roger Bannister的故事And what Roger Bannister's story does能够帮我们打破一些这样的束缚what it helps us do is chip away some of these limitations挖掘自身的潜能and understand our potential谢谢你 请说Thank you. Yes那天你提到了关于你祖母的故事The day when you told the story about your grandmother她是如何历经坎坷后 终于看到and how she was able to still see so much beauty in the world世间种种美景的after everything she had been through这深深地打动了我was very, very moving for me在这样的学术氛围中能如此感动And that was a very unique experience to实在是一种特殊而难得的体验be so emotionally moved in this academic setting真的很有力量So that was really powerful也使我重新审视自己And that really made me reevaluate the way看待人生的方式以及I look at my life and the way that珍惜我所有的东西的方式I appreciate the things that I have谢谢 谢谢Thank you, Thank you我很喜欢那个"我们忘记坏事情I really like the idea that we can get over things比我们想象的快得多"的观点bad things a lot quicker than we would anticipate我经常思考这一点I just think that you know so often我们总是骗自己说有多成功we cheat ourselves of so much success多么有潜能 多么快乐so much potential, pleasure但我想but I think, you know朝着目标向前冲just the idea of going forward and就算没能达到也会最终释怀的想法that we will ultimately get over it if it doesn't work out是非常重要的That's really important没错Right, yes. So you know我们有所成就时just like when we achieve something good能回复平和 感觉就像从前一样we go back to base level and feel like as we did before而当我们失败时also when we fail要是知道我们是能重新振作的And it's a real liberating feeling to know that是会很快恢复的that we are resilient249是很能让人解脱的that we will recover谢谢Thank you请说Yes在我看来 找到竞争主义者和享乐主义者之间的For me, it was important to realize balance between the rat racer平衡点很重要and the hedonist以及短期益处和长期益处之间的平衡finding the balance between short term benefit and long term benefit是的Right. You know人生经常会遇到"非此则彼"的情况so much of our lives is about ＂either or＂要么我是个成功的竞争主义者Either I'm a successful rat racer要么就是个放弃成功的享乐主义者or I'm a hedonist who has given up essentially on success而我们其实通常都能将两者融合Whereas what we can very  often do is reconcile the two就像咬一口蛋糕还保持其基本完整You know, eat the cake and leave it whole - so it seems长远益处和近期益处的结合Future benefit and present benefit in one谢谢Thank you被人所知而非被证明 以及你教课的方式To seek to be known and not validated - and the way you taught the class比如上课前会讲opening up, let's say你人生中经历的许多失败each individual failure you had in your life我就觉得自己I found myself我自己的失败 它们是不同的my own failures - they are different但又是统一的but they are the same我觉得没那么孤单了I felt less lonely谢谢 你知道吗Thank you. You know when我在第一节课就讲过的 Carl Rogers说过what I shared at I think the very first class here was what Carl Rogers said"最个人的也是最大众的"which is ＂what is most personal is most general＂因为从本质来说 这些都是人性Because deep down humanity is humanity, is humanity当我们活在这世上 有被了解的欲望And when we live in the world with the desire to be known表达自我expressing ourselves这是我们最能和他人触碰的时候that's I think when we can reach out most to others不管是爱情whether it's in a romantic relationship友情whether it's in friendships或是同学之间whether it's in a classroom谢谢Thank you请说Yes我从这门课上学到的一点就是One thing I would take away from this class is要学会感恩to be conscious about being grateful因为有时我感觉because sometimes I feel that人们总是把最爱的人当做理所当然you take for granted the people you love the most感恩 我们的周围和内心To be grateful - there are so many treasures of happiness都有那么多快乐和幸福of well being all around us and within us最重要的是睁开我们的双眼And the challenge is just to open our eyes去感受它们to appreciate them请说Yes对我来说特别棒的就是What was really amazing to me这门课对其他不是学生的人很开放was how open others where not in the class比如家人以及其他不学这门课的同学such as family and other friends not in the class同样也能这样改变他们的人生to also take on this change in their life他们并不会刻意感觉到这对他们有好处They didn't see it as some cookie self-help thing而是but really as"对 也许我该记下所有＂Oh yeah, maybe I should take note of我生活中该感恩的东西" 以及其他的all the things I'm grateful for in my life＂and other exercises是的Yeah, you know这就是传递this is paying it forward有时我们很害怕说出自己看重的东西Sometimes we are so afraid to talk about things that matter to us而当我们说出它时And when we do当我们是真实的and when we are real当我们是真挚的when we are genuine当我们表达自我时when we express ourselves这些东西是会传染的these things are contagious我们会将其传递出去And we pay it forward它们再继续不断传递And then they pay it forward谢谢 请说Thank you. Yes在学这门课之前Before taking this class我将自己的悲喜都归咎于周围的事物I blame my mood and my happiness a lot on those going around me比如我的环境like my circumstances学这门课真的帮到我很多So taking this class really helped me意识到周围环境其实并不会掌控你的快乐aware the circumstances really don't control your happiness level我应该更积极地了解自己的感受that I have more than an active role like how I feel是的Right. You know还记得我们讲过remember one of the things we talked about is that至少我不认为什么事都能一帆风顺at least I don't believe that things necessarily happen for the best有时我们会遇到坏情况You know there are some times where there are bad circumstances糟糕的情况poor circumstances艰难的情况hard circumstances最大的挑战其实是我们如何the challenge though is how can we make the best能更好地利用发生的一切of that which have happened我们确实比自己想象的更有力量来掌控And we do have much more control over it than we think请说Yes这门课让我几乎每天都能很多次地The class allowed me so many times during almost every day感受到我是个普通人to understand something is part of me being human00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,600我允许自己为人as part my permission to be human而不是自己臆想出来的rather than conceive it as my feelings或者总想着我没做好的事or something that I wasn't doing well enough允许为人So the permission - you know我反复多次提到了它 并将继续提到I've repeated it for so many times and I'll continue to repeat it即使到了生命最后几分钟也会继续until use every last minute that I have to do it因为从很多方面来说它确实是幸福的基础because it's really on so many levels the foundation of well being不幸的是我们如今的文化And unfortunately too much in our culture today过于强调我所说的what is going on is what I call"巨大的骗局"＂the great deception＂我们认为每个人都很棒 就我不行where we think well everyone is doing great except for me所以我要假装我也很棒So I'm going to pretend that I'm doing great too然后我们就成了"巨大骗局"的一部分And then we become part of that great deception一定要反复强调reinforcing it允许为人The permission to be human请讲Yes关于完美主义的那些内容The whole piece about perfectionism我从没觉得自己是个完美主义者I have never seen myself as a perfectionist我觉得那是种自我否定and I think it's just kind of self denial通过课堂上的练习以及So through the exercises in the course as well as课本的内容you know in the book我们做的各种阅读 真的使我different readings that we've done have really allowed me to去探索 去接受它explore that, and accept that并主动地作出改变来远离它and make proactive changes in my life to grow away from that很好 完美主义同样是人们经常隐藏的Great. You know perfectionism is again another thing that so many people hide因为完美主义者从定义上说就不愿意显露出弱点because perfectionist almost by definition doesn't want to show the weakness正如我在课上所说的And as I mentioned in the class我认为不完美主义是在向着unperfectionism for me has been the most important幸福前进的道路上最重要的一点in terms of my progression toward becoming happier接受不可避免的失败Accepting failure as an inevitable接受人生不会是一条直线accepting that life is not a straight line而是有起有伏的螺旋but rather a spiral with ups and downs但主轴仍然在along with the general trajectory也就是进步 成长 和允许为人as improvement, growth and permission我觉得最有共鸣的一点就是So for me one of the things that really resonated就是重新构建问题was the idea of reframing the question在学期刚开始时At the very beginning你讲到消极和积极的研究you spoke about the fact that there was the 21 to 1 ratio所得到的21:1的比例of negative to positive research对于我这样马上要进行神经生物学研究的人来说And as someone who will be going into research in neurobiology能够重建世界观是很有趣的it was really interesting just reframing of a world view开始思考just start thinking of也许well perhaps开始思考对于研究来说什么是最重要的start looking at what is working in terms of research我会在自己的学术领域中用到它And, so I will take that with me into my academics问题的重要性 问题能创造我们的现实The importance of questions - questions create our reality还记得公车上的孩子们的问题吗Remember the question of the children on the bus很多人都忽视了which most people completely missed年复一年我们在城市中对高危人群remember years and years of research that was done in the inner cities进行研究with at risk population却总是找不到改善他们生活的方法where they missed the answer to how can we improve their lives因为他们没有问出积极的问题They missed it because they did not also ask the positive question我很快会讲 这也适用于我们生活的各个方面And it applies into every area of our lives as I'll talk about soon请说Yes此前我一直是个拖延的人Before, I always procrastinate这是我学习中的大问题That is my big problem for my academic现在我进步了很多Now I improved a lot非常感谢你Thank you very much拖延症Procrastination - you know70%的大学生抱怨说有拖延症70 percent of students in universities complain about procrastination这是个大问题It's a huge issue克服它的一种方式And one of the ways to overcome it克服它的最好方式就是去做the best way to overcome it is to just do it还记得五分钟休息吗Just start - remember the five minute take-off那非常重要That's so important谢谢Thank you请说Yes我对我们I was just really阅读的Gilbert的作品印象非常深刻really impressed with the reading that we read by Gilbert讲的是关于生活中的好运that was talking about how the good luck in your life以及你觉得自己置身的美好状态and the wonderful circumstances you find yourself in其实都是你自己创造的are really your own making通过改变你的外表和衣着And by changing your outlook and your patterns你可以每日逐渐改变自己的幸福感you can really make a difference in your happiness day to day很多人活着会想Yeah. You know so many people live lives and think"这个..."＂well…＂要是我没遇到这个人就好了only I didn't meet that person要是这种事情没发生在我身上if only this hasn't happen to me我就会很幸福的I would have been happy要明白这其中很大一部分And understanding that so much of it is都是由我们的理解决定的是很重要的determined by our perception is very empowering请说Yes对我来说最有意义的What has been most meaningful for me其实就是这门课的存在has been in fact that this class exists有这么多人关心幸福and that there are so many people interested in happiness因为在哈佛这样的氛围中cause you know the culture here at Harvard我们不一定总有机会来思考这个we don't always get the chance to really think about it正如你所说And as you said, you know it's你只是提醒我们一些已经知道的事you are just reminding us what we already know也让我们知道 我们了解它是正常的but it's also letting us know that we are not crazy for knowing it是的Yeah, we are not我们并不孤单We are not alone我们需要有人提醒 其他人也需要And we need that reminder and other people need that reminder通过提醒其他人And by reminding other people我们也提醒了自己we also remind ourselves谢谢Thank you请说Yes我觉得是正直的概念For me it's the concept of integrity因为我认为我们都是诚实的人because I think we are all honest people但就是每天的各种小事情but it's the little things at times each day让我们的信仰屈服when we compromise our beliefs或者让我们言行不一or act in a way that doesn't align with how we think we should这会对我们的自尊造成影响and that that really takes toll on our self esteem所以时刻意识到并保持我们的正直And so the idea of being constantly aware of and maintaining our integrity能让我们对自我感觉更良好I think really stands to helps us feel better about ourselves当我们说真话时Because when we tell the truth其实正给自己传递了某种信息we are communicating a certain message to ourselves当我们表达自我时when we express ourselves我们在给自己传递某种信息we are communicating a certain message to ourselves这个信息就是我的话有分量 我有分量And the message is my words count; I count当我们表达When we express"我很棒"＂we are good enough＂无需过分想给他人留下印象don't need to put on a facade or impress而这个信息Then the message这个自我知觉理论能提升the self perception theory actually enhances我们对自身的看法how we feel about ourselves更不用说对人际关系的提升了not to mention that it helps interpersonal communication也能使世界变得更美好And the world would be a better place如果越来越多人能够正直if more and more people acted with integrity那么同样自我和他人之间的分歧就会消除And again, self and others divide dissolves请说Yes你在课堂上和我们分享的One the the phrases that you shared with us一句话深深震撼了我in your lectures that's really impacted me我事实上已经将其作为了座右铭and I've actually embraced it as a kind of personal mantra is"学会失败 或从失败中学习 没有别的法子"＂learn to fail or fail to learn; there's no other way＂经过这门课的学习 我意识到And I kind of realized throughout the course, this class我曾经是个怎样的完美主义者what a perfectionist I have been以及我人生中有多少次and how much time throughout my life我的早期回忆一直在折磨自己my earliest memories have stuck really torturing myself焦虑 以及对犯错的恐惧the anxiety and fear of making a mistake重构这些 真正回头看那些不可避免的and to reframe that and really look at those inevitable moments00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:08,800失败时刻 能成为我前进的动力where I messed up as you know fuel for moving forward, as opportunities我面前突然一片开阔has been wildly liberating非常感谢你So I thank you for that谢谢Thank you"学会失败 从失败中学习"的概念The notion of ＂learn to fail and fail to learn＂其实也是我的个人座右铭as you know is my personal mantra as well它能让人解脱It's very liberating在人际关系中It's liberating within the context of relationship在学业成绩中within the context of our academic performance在一个组织的各个层面中within the context of an organization on every level重要的是要知道没有其他更好的学习方法And it's important to understand that there is no other way to learn不管是画圆圈或学走路whether it's to draw a circle or to walk这只是人生的一部分It's just part of life如果我们接受它And if we accept it我们就能更快乐we are much happier for it谢谢Thank youElizabethElizabeth对我来说特别有意义的就是What's really been really meaningful to me in deciding真正要专心追求的东西what concentration to pursue快乐是最终的目的is the idea of happiness is ultimate currency要试图消除外界的影响and trying to kind of eliminate outside influences认真思考对我来说有意义的到底是什么and really think about what is meaningful to me在我所学的东西中什么能让我快乐and what will make me happy in what I study谢谢So thank you最终目的The ultimate currency很多人说美国人you know many people say about Americans之所以抑郁水平不断攀升that one of the reasons why the levels of depression are on the rise之所以有那么多不快乐的人one of the reasons why there are so many unhappy people其中一个原因就是美国人有过高的期望is because Americans have too high expectations这是错的And that's not true我不同意 研究也不能证明这一点I disagree with it; and the research disagrees with it这不是高期望或低期望的问题It's not about having high versus low expectations而是正确或错误的期望的问题it's about having right versus wrong expectations这适用于很多领域And it applies to, to many areas但我们要明白的一点是but one of the things to understand is that我们在人生中从何处获得满足where do we look to gain gratification from our life是来自下一句赞美Is it from, again getting the next accolade下一次升职 或人们说我们有多棒吗the next promotion or the people tell us how wonderful our concentration is?还是来自我们想做的事Or is it from doing what we want to do换言之我们最终的目的所决定的事in other words, being determined by the ultimate currency而最终的目的就是快乐and understanding that happiness is the ultimate currency?谢谢Thank you请说Yes我觉得这整个学期 这一整年I feel that all this semester and all this year in fact我都一直在I have been trying to要么上课 要么跑向实验室I have been either going to class or running to lab or寻找方法来填满我的每一天just finding some way to fill up every hour of my day似乎我永远在从一处跑向另一处And it seems like I'm constantly running from one place to another似乎我整个人生And it seems all my life I have been都在试图填满每一分钟just essentially trying to fill up every hour of my day我觉得特别重要的And I feel what's really important and我真的学到的就是你所说的what I really got from this is what you said about做得少其实是更多doing less is more我会很认真地在我接下来And that's something I'm definitely going to take在哈佛的三年中将这一点铭记于心like keep in mind the next three years when I'm here对 做得少其实是更多Yeah, less is more数量会影响质量Quantity affects quality我们经常好奇And we so often wonder you know"我为什么不快乐"＂how come I am unhappy?＂我人生中有这么多美好的东西I have so many things in my life that are wonderful and amazing这可能就是问题的一部分And that could be part of the problem因为更多不一定意味着更好Because more is not always better要把事情简化很难 这是很重要的Not easy to simplify - that's so very important非常重要So very important请说Yes复杂性另一面的简单性的概念The concept of simplicity on the other side of complexity我觉得非常奇妙is so awful for me, because you know当一个人成长时when you grow up in life就会加入各种各样的变量 变得越来越复杂you add all these variables and it becomes more and more complicated不能把问题简化是很让人沮丧的And as a is certain frustration about not being able to simplify但你说到了复杂的顶点后But when you say at the top of the complexity你会发现那种美is when you realize the beauty发现简单是出现在复杂之后realizing that the simplicity comes after complexity而非复杂之前not before complexity而对复杂性的理解And the knowledge of complexity那是个非常棒的概念that's an amazing conceptOliver Wendell Holmes讲到了So Oliver Wendell Holmes talks about the simplicity复杂性另一面的简单性on the other side of complexity这适用于不管是... 这门课大部分内容And that applies whether it's to ideas - and again this class都是很简单的most of it is very simple没有什么特别复杂的概念And there were no very complicated concepts here但它们很多都是复杂性另一面的简单But many of them are the simplicity on the other side of complexity对个人来说也是一样Same on the individual level我们经常会遇到困难 生活很艰难Very often we go through hardships and our life is so difficult我们会经历危机 严酷的考验We go through a crisis, through a crucible而我们要做的就是明白And what we need to do to understand当我们经历了这些复杂 艰难when we are going through that complexity and hardship严峻的考验和坎坷起伏之后and the crucible and the difficulties另一面就是简单is that there is simplicity on the other side通常我们要做的往往就是坚持Very often all we need to do is hang on再等待一会儿Just wait a little bit longer就会更清楚明了And there'll be more clarity00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,200更能成长more growth更能进步more development最终更快乐more joy at the end of it请说Yes在传递话筒时On your passing on the mic我在想I was like"天啊 我不知该说什么＂Oh my God, I don't really have anything to say太多人了 我没法做到的"There are so many people, I will never do that.＂然后你说勇气不是没有畏惧And then you said courage is not about fearless而是有了畏惧还坚持向前but about having fear and doing it anyway所以我一下就把顾虑都抛弃了So I just threw my pack over the wall就像"给我话筒 我要说!"I was like＂Give me that mic!

Good请说Yes你前几节课讲了关于匿名的世界You've spoken in the past few lectures about in an anonymous world如果一切行为是匿名的 我们会如何生活and about how we would live if our action is anonymous我认为知道我们真正想要的并勇敢追求And I think that knowing what we want and actually pursuing我们想要的东西是很有挑战性的what we want is or can be really challenging甚至是让人畏惧的even frightening能够真正了解自己想要的It just seems like you really know what you want and pursued并一心追求它and pursue what you want我觉得这是非常值得自豪的And I think that is something to be really proud of而你确实实践了你所教给我们的东西And you definitely seem to practice what you preach and teach因此我对你有着崇高的敬意And I have enormous amount of respect for you because of that谢谢Thank you谢谢Thank you你讲过很多东西There are many things但有一样我确实学到的就是but one thing I'm really learned from this class is专注于我们真正想做的事it is important to focus on what we really, really like to do你在课堂上说过很多次You said many time in the class教书就是你的使命teaching is your calling我能看得出来你有多热爱教学And I can see how much you enjoy teaching这让我很有感触And it was really inspiring to me我会记住这一点So I think I will remember that并不断寻找我的使命and I will keep looking for my calling我真正想做的到底是什么and what I really, really like to do谢谢Thank you请说Yes找到拿着话筒的人Let's take someone with the microphone把话筒给你And we'll get it to you有人有话筒吗Anyone has a microphone?好的Wait.

Yeah我是Milwaukee公立学校体系的一名老师And also I am a proud educator in the Milwaukee public school system在座有将来想做老师的吗Are there any future educators in the room?"Milwaukee"＂Milwaukee!＂你之前讲过的And what you speak ofAlbert Bandura和自我效能理论as Albert Bandura and the theory of self efficacy是非常重要的is so very important任何对帮助青年成长或教育有兴趣的人And anyone who is interested in youth empowerment or education对孩子们有高期望it's very, very important是非常非常重要的No.1 to have high expectations for our children尤其是有色人种的孩子especially children of color作为教育工作者cause as an educator我明白Bandura和Dweck想表达的意思I see what Bandura talks about and what Dweck talks about对这些孩子来说弱化了的现实this diminished sense of reality for these kids为他们创建了一个完全不同的世界that produces whole other world for them我想强调并着重突出这一点So you know I just want to really focus and kind of stress that很感谢你讲了这个And thank you for sharing that对孩子有高期望是很重要的That's important to have high expectations for children当然对自己也是很重要的and for yourselves of course没错 自我实现预言经常会改变世界Right. Beliefs in self-fulfilling prophecies so often create the world我们的以及我们周围的世界our world and the world of those around us基于我们的信仰based on our beliefs我们再听几位Let's take a couple of more然后我再快速总结一下And I'll do my quick summary请说Yes好的OK请讲吧Go for it我知道这已经被提到好几次了I know this has been mentioned a couple times already但真的很容易将我们的不快乐归咎他人but it's so easy to blame others for our unhappiness或他人的行为or others' actions甚至我们自己的行为or even our own actions for our unhappiness但你说过很多次我们潜意识中But you've talked so many times about what's going on发生的事以及in our own subconscious and how潜意识的影响what subconscious may be doing可能才是阻止我们不快乐 错了is might actually preventing our unhappiness阻止我们快乐的原因preventing our happiness rather这让我回想起Marva CollinsAnd it just brought me back to Marva Collins如果学生做错了什么事and how if a student did something wrong她会让他们看一遍字母表说she made them go through the alphabet and say这些都是我好的方面these are all good things about me我们真的应该尝试去想And it's really been enlightening to try to think about我想的是什么 对他人不做什么how am I thinking what am I not doing to others或他人对我做什么or what others are doing to me但要思考是什么阻止我变成一个更幸福的人but what am I thinking that's preventing me from being a happier person很好 谢谢That's wonderful. Thank you再听两位同学Let's take two more那位同学So up there这门课上我印象最深的两样东西就是I guess two things that really stuck with me from the class is你放的小宝宝学走路的录像the little clip you showed of the baby learning to walk你想表达的是这个宝宝And just like what you conveyed the idea like this baby并不知道他为何会摔倒has no reason to like have a sense of why he's falling down也不知道他该为此感到羞耻and it should be anything that he should be ashamed of这是种很有效的方法让我们知道And that was just like a very effective way to kind of convey like我们要学会失败 从失败中学习we always saying kind of learn to fail and fail to learn这让我感触良多That really stuck with me以及你愿意说出你自己在做And also your own willingness to describe your own kind of rises心理学研究时经历的起起伏伏and falls as you went through your studies of psychology以及你在剑桥和哈佛的经历and your experiences at Cambridge and Harvard你愿意很开诚布公地和我们分享and just your willingness to be very open about it这让我感受到It's kind of empowering like, for me is我要毕业了 要继续发展I'm about to graduate and I go forward并不清楚自己想做什么kind of maybe don't know what exactly you want to do会考虑各种选择and you consider different options会感受到对失败的恐惧and obviously that fear of failures尤其是来自像哈佛这样的地方especially when you come from a place like Harvard更是让人倍感压力is maybe especially xx而你愿意和我们分享这些经历You just you are willing to share these experiences and empowering我就会重新考虑我要做的决定I feel as I kind of question the choices I am going to make对此我非常感谢So I really appreciate that谢谢Thank you请说Yes每一天都是美好的Every day is a beautiful day对此感恩能够让我们在做自己And to be grateful for that somehow makes it easier to go out不喜欢的事时能更轻松and try to do things that maybe even we didn't like以及常识其实并不那么人尽皆知And common sense is not that common这些都是... 学的很多东西都是我已经知道的And these are all - a lot of things that I've learned I already knew但我现在是在哈佛学到的but now I learned it at Harvard好的 很好Great. All right我们再听一位同学Let's take one more我是大四的 马上要毕业了So I'm senior and I'm leaving这可能是我在哈佛上的最后一节课So this is my last lecture class at Harvard如果我说的东西对于班里的低年级同学So I apologize if this message seems a little more geared太过难以接受 我将为此道歉towards the undergrads in the class我印象非常深刻的一点是one of the things that I'm very impressed with这样一门涉及面广泛的大课is a large lecture class that is so far reaching有如此多人想上这门课as far as the number of people who want to take it班里的同学各种各样and the diversity of students in the class但我想和大家分享的经历就是But I guess this experience that I like to share is that我来到这个课堂I came into this class我很诚实 必须承认admittedly because I value honesty I will say I took it我认为这会是对艰难的大四because I thought it would be a nice complement春季学期一个很好的补充to an otherwise a difficult senior spring我就想"这应该是门挺好玩的课"And I thought,＂Well, it'll be nice class to have.＂在我大二时And my sophomore year我有点开始探索自我I had gone through kind of a self discovery压抑的生活让我用不同的方式来看待事物post depression that made me kind of value things in a different way我当时So I've been我有了大二的这些想法I've been using these lessons that I learned sophomore year我就想"也许这门课就是多余的了"And I thought＂Well maybe this class will just be redundant＂结果后来我又在大四的春季学期Turns out I went through another really difficult time经历了艰难的时期during my senior spring抱歉And um... Sorry我最想和在座的低年级同学分享的I guess what I'd like to relate to especially the undergrads here就是如果你是大一的is that it's very important if you are a freshmen大二的if you are a sophomore甚至大三都不算晚it's not even too late as juniors最重要的是搞清楚it's very important to prioritize在学校里对你最重要的是什么what's really important to you at this school我告诉你们不是论文And let me tell you it's not the paper不是讨论的问题it's not the problem set不是当你的朋友需要你it's not getting a full 8 hours sleep空出一小时时 你却说要保证八小时睡眠when your friends need your attention for an hour因为这里的人是最重要的because the people here matter the most你以后会想念他们And you'll miss them如果你不珍惜现在和他们一起的时光And if you don't spend time with them now以后很难再有时间和他们共度you won't have time to spend time with them later on这非常重要So it's very important搞清楚真正对你有意义的是什么prioritize what is meaningful for you和你在学校中真正想做的事and what you really, really want to do in this school因为在你不经意间because before you know it它就要结束了it will be over谢谢你让我铭记这一点So thank you for helping me remember that使我的这个学期变得有意义and making it meaningful semester谢谢 谢谢你们Thank you. Thank you. Thank you现在我来总结一下Let me summarize你们刚刚讲到的这些所有东西All of these things that you already mentioned before这些不一定是最重要的these are not necessarily the most important这些东西These are the ones that我无须翻阅笔记就能想到for me without looking back on my notes came up首先First你所问的问题the questions that you ask经常都会决定你所做的探索will very often determine the quest that you take如果我们只问消极的问题 比如And if we only ask the negative questions such as"为什么这么多人失败"＂why do so many of these individuals fail?＂我们就没法看到潜藏在Then we won't see the potential for greatness每个人心中的伟大 如果我们只问that exists in each individual if we only ask"我的人际关系该怎样改善"＂How can my relationship be improved?＂我们就无法看见身边的人Then we will not see all the wonders and the treasures所拥有的宝贵财富和奇迹and the miracle that exist in the person next to us我们同样要问积极的问题We also need to ask the positive question我的人际关系中有什么好的方面what is good about my relationship?我的同伴有哪些优点What is great about my partner?我自己有哪些优点What is wonderful about myself?什么对我最有意义What is meaningful to me?什么能使我愉快What is pleasurable to me?我擅长什么What am I good at?问题会带来探索Questions start a quest探索的内容取决于我们And the kind of the quest they start depends on the quality所问的问题of the question that we ask我们常说信念创造现实The four minute mile - beliefs create reality不仅是信念 更宽泛地说Not only beliefs, but to a great extent00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:17,800我们如何理解现实才是最后所得的结果how we perceive reality is what actually comes trueMarva Collins相信她的学生Marva Collins believed in her students相信她的学生 然后奇迹发生了believes in her students and miracles happen那些朽木难雕的学生因为信念而成就卓越Those unteachable ones become extraordinary because of beliefs还记得John Carlton关于商学院学生的研究吗Remember John Carlton's study once again about business school graduates将卓越和平庸划分开的有两样东西Two thing distinguish the extraordinary from the rest一个是他们总在问问题One was that they were always asking question总想学习到更多always wanting to learn more心怀谦逊 对成长 幸福和自尊having that humbleness that's so important for growth and well being尤为重要and self esteem其次And second他们相信自我they believed in themselves他们有自信They had the confidence他们有自我效能通往成功和进步They had the self efficacy to succeed and to thrive我们如何提升信念?How do we improve the belief?通过拉伸自我 去尝试By putting ourselves on the line, by coping挑战自我by taking risks通过具象化使我们明白自己可以做到by showing ourselves that we can do it through visualization成功没有捷径There are no short cuts to success学会失败 从失败中学习Learn to fail or fail to learn历史上很多成功的杰出人士It is no coincident that the most successful同样也是那些失败最惨重的人extraordinary people in history were also the ones这并非巧合who failed the most无论是在体育界 Babe Ruthwhether it was in sports, Babe Ruth比同时代任何球员三振出局次数都多who struck out more than any other players of his time但也打出过最多的全垒打but also hit the most home runs还有Michael Jordanwhether it was Michael Jordan一次次地表现出失败who described his failures time and time again赛点时最后一个绝杀没有投进whether it's taking the game winning shot where he didn't make it或不断重复的机械训练or practicing over and over and over againThomas Edison 比任何科学家It's no coincident that Thomas Edison获得专利都多的人the person who had more patents同样也是失败过最多次的人than any other scientist in history这也并非巧合is also the scientist who had failed the most times还记得Dean Simonton对科学家和艺术家的研究吗Remember Dean Simonton's work on scientists as well as the artists最成功的往往是失败得最多的The most successful ones were also the ones who failed the most没有别的方法可以学习There is no other way to learn而且如果我们接受这一点Moreover if we accept this如果我们接受这种成长的心态if we accept this growth mindset而不是Carol Dweck所说的固定心态as opposed to fixed mindset that Carol Dweck talks about it我们不仅会更有进步Not only we will be, improve more也会更加快乐幸福we will also be happier因为这样就不会每次经历都是because then not every experience is a threat to our ego对自我 自尊的一种威胁to our self, to our self esteem如果我们接受失败是不可避免的If we accept the failure is inevitable不管是在人际关系中whether in a relationship存在失望和争吵there are disappointments and arguments还是在个人生活or in individual life或从国家来说or on a national level没有完美的国家 没有完美的人no perfect country, no perfect person没有完美的组织no perfect organization如果我们明白生命是个上升的螺旋And if we understand that life is about this而非一条直线as opposed to about this我们会幸福得多we'll be so much happier冷静得多so much calmer并且也更加成功and paradoxically so much more successful允许为人 世界上有两种人The permission to be human - there are two kinds of people不会经历情感创伤who don't experience painful emotions哪两种人Who are they again?精神病患者和死人The psychopath and dead people我很高兴你们都不是精神病患者 也都活着I'm so glad none of you are psychopath and that you are all alive这让这门课好上很多It makes the class so much better安全很多so much safer你不可能学完这门课后You are not going to come out of this class就能一直保持人生平顺experience a constant high没人能一直保持人生平顺No one experiences a constant high你还会经历坎坷起伏You are going to continue to have those ups and downs我希望你们唯一能The only difference I hope感受到的区别就是当经历感情创伤时that you will experience now is that when you experience a painful emotion你会看着它说you will look at it and say"我只是普通人 我很难过＂Oh, I'm human. It hurts真希望事情不是这样I wish it weren't that way但我接受它but I accept it就像接受重力定律一样just like you accept the law of gravity因为重力定律是一种物理本质because the law of gravity is as much part of physical nature就像感情创伤是一种人性本质as painful emotion is a part of human nature允许为人Permission to be human在课堂上我们讲了很多种干预We talked about many interventions that work in this class大多数干预并不起作用 正如Most interventions don't work as we've seenSomerville的研究和其他研究显示的whether it's with the Somerville study or others而日记可以Journaling works在写东西时 我们在打开内心When we write, when we open up不管是写 还是和我们关心的人倾诉whether it's in writing or sharing with a person we care about可以是心理咨询师And it can be a therapist可以是好朋友 爱人It can be our best friend, our partner当我们分享 开放内心时When we share, when we open up我们就能建立一种感觉we are able to make sense用Antonovsky的话来说就是"关联性的感觉"create ＂a sense of coherence＂ in the words of Antonovsky来看待我们生命中的经历about the experiences of our lives得到更高层次的快乐and enjoy higher levels of happiness这是有用的It works我们周围和内心有那么多快乐There are so many treasures of happiness all around us and within us而问题在于我们注意到它们了吗And the question is do we notice them?还是把它们想成理所当然Or do we take them for granted?回忆一下appreciate这个词Remember the word, appreciate有两种意思It has two meanings:一种是表示谢谢 这是很好的one is to say thank you for something which is a nice thing to do人们常说感恩是最高尚的美德again, sister called the gratitude is the highest of virtues感激是一件很好的事It's a nice thing to be grateful第二种意思也同样重要The second meaning is no less important意思是增值Appreciate means to grow当我们感激生活中好的方面And when we appreciate the good in our lives感激人际关系中好的方面when we appreciate the good in our relationship感激我们的伴侣when we appreciate our partner朋友 同学our friends, our classmates感激我们的国家when we appreciate our country这些好处就会增值the good grows不幸的是相反的事也会发生Unfortunately the opposite is also the case但我们不予以感恩时When we don't appreciate好的方面就会贬值the good depreciates世上没有完美的人际关系There is no perfect relationship没有完美的人 没有完美的国家no perfect person, no perfect country最重要的是要关注什么是有效的The important thing though is to focus on what is working感激它 它才能增值Appreciate it so that it appreciates很多人疑惑自己为什么总是不快乐So many people wonder why they are not happy即使他们已经得到了想得到的一切even though they have all the things that they want in their lives为什么 因为好东西太多有时也不是好事Why? Because there can be too much of a good thing还记得我最喜欢的歌吗Remember my favorite piece of music?Whitney Houston的《我将永远爱你》Whitney Houston - And I Will Always Love You10分满分Straight 第二喜欢的 贝多芬第九交响乐 9.5分Second favorite: Beethoven's 9th, 9.在一起播放 就是噪音Play together - play together: noise不是19.5分 10分或5分Not 19.5, not 10, not 只是噪音Noise好东西太多也不是好事There can be too much of a good thing要将一切简化说起来容易 做起来难Easier said than done to simplify但记住我们说过比物质充裕But remember that a much better predictor更能带来幸福的是时间充裕of well being than material affluence is time affluence简化 果断坚决Simplify. Assert yourself在适当的时候学会说"不"Say no at times when it's appropriate弄清楚你究竟Find out what you really, really真正想做的东西 然后去做really want to do with your life and do it最能预示幸福的是 人际关系The No.1 predictor of well being - relationships是最能预示幸福的The No.1 predictor of well being你现在和未来所经营的一段an intimate relationship that you cultivate now and in the future亲密关系比世界任何事都重要matters more than anything else in the world对甚至比问问题更重要Yes, even more than a problem set比考试更重要even more than an exam比我们有多成功 多被人景仰even more than how wildly successful we are更重要得多and how admired we are对 成功会使我们的幸福感陡升Yeah, that will lead to a spike in our well being而很快又降到基础水平very quickly will go back to base level就像获得长期聘用的大学教授just like the tenure professors went back to the base level就像彩票中了大奖的人Just like the lottery winners那些以为自己And the highly successful individuals非常成功的人who thought they had made it很快会回到基准水平甚至更低and went to the base level and below因为他们不知道什么会让他们更快乐because they didn't know what would make them happier这就是一种Well, this is what can其中一种让我们更快乐的方法one of the things that can make us happier00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:29,500经营一段感情就意味着为之投入And to cultivate relationship means to invest in them向其中投入时间to put time into them彼此分享和交流To share, to open up就像我们会投入Just like we would invest如果我们找到理想的工作if we found our ideal job, ideal workplace我们会将自己投入其中we would start to invest then人际关系也是一样Same with relationship电影总是在结尾时爱情才开始Remember movies end where love begins在大屏幕暗下来后继续经营感情It's about cultivating the relationship after the screen comes down在日落之后 此时我们的投入after the sunset - that's where the investment我们的投入才有了回报that's where the return of investment comes思想带给我们的前进是有限的Our mind can only take us only so far我很了解积极心理学You know I know positive psychology pretty well我实践了所有我教的知识I apply everything that I talk about here然而我真的觉得如果However, I really think that if I was not我不知道精神肉体联系cognizant of the body mind connection并将精神肉体联系应用于我的生活and applying the body mind connection to my life我一定没有今天这么快乐I would be far less happy than I am today为什么 因为我会屈服于上帝决定的基准水平Why? Because I would be compromising on my base level God's given基因决定的基准幸福水平gene's given level of well being因为当我们不锻炼时Because when we don't  exercise就像打了镇静剂it's like taking a depressant我们必须和本性抗争And we have to fight our nature和本性抗争是很难的And it's very hard to fight our nature提升我们幸福的水平是很难的It's very difficult to enhance our levels of well being00:59:55,100 --> 01:00:03,而同时要和本性抗争则是难以想象的困难as is to have to also fight against nature is incredibly difficult还记得灵药吗So remember the wonder drug每周锻炼四次 每次半小时Exercise at least four times a week for 30 minutes如果可以 如果你有兴趣If you can, if you are interested去做做瑜伽或冥想do some formal yoga or mindful meditation打坐冥想sitting meditation如果不行 那么至少If not, at the very least每天深呼吸几次breathe -breathe deeply a few times a day三次深呼吸就有显著效果Three deep breaths can make a big difference现在就可以试试Now is not a bad time to do it睡眠 可能的话八小时或接近八小时Sleep - when possible 8 hours or somewhere around 8 hours a night of sleep以及触摸And touch抱 拥抱 这个总被忽视的感官却非常重要Hug, embrace - an underused sense is so important被了解而非被证明Be known rather than be validated我们所有人都需要被证明And again, all of us have the need to be validated并不是说要完全去除我们依赖别人的自尊It's not about getting rid of our dependent self esteem但更首要的是被了解 去表达but it is very much about first and foremost being known expressing而非给他人留下印象rather than impressing人生会变得更轻松 更简单Life becomes so much lighter, so much easier更让人兴奋so much more exciting如果我们能表达自我when we are about expressing ourselves被了解而非被证明Being known rather than being validated无论是和我们的伴侣whether it's with our romantic partner家人 朋友 同事 同学our family, our friends, our colleagues, our class这都是在长期人际关系中the foundation of the growth of intimacy01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:49,300亲密和激情增加的基础and passion in long term relationships说起来容易做起来难Easier said than done这非常重要It's so important我想列出前十Now I tried to have top 但我做不到 有一个不得不提but I couldn't. I had to have one more所以你们要谅解so you'll have to excuse me最后一点 能将所有东西整合在一起的一点The last one and the one that brings together all the others就是关于转变的内容on so many levels is the one about change终于讲到了 你们一整个学期就等着它呢Finally. You've been waiting the entire semester just for this - well希望不会辜负你们的期待was worth the wait I hope有两种... 事实上有很多种类型There are two types - I mean there are many types但有两种类型的学生but there are also two types of graduates上过这门课或其他from 1504 or any other class or workshop关于获得更高层次的幸福的课that is about attaining higher levels of happiness一种是会感觉很愉快One that at best enjoys a temperate high或美好的回忆 然后回到基准水平Or nice memory and goes back down to base level第二种同样感觉很愉快And the second that enjoys maybe the same temperate high虽然不可能持续整个人生which cannot last our entire lives但仍然在未来持续增长but still enjoy continuous growth throughout their lives其区别 最基本的区别就在于And the difference, the primary difference你是否发生了行为转变is whether or not you introduce behavioral changes还记得Peter Drucker说过Remember Peter Drucker - what he said每当人们去参加他的周末研讨班whenever people came to him for a weekend - seminar intensive他周一时都会说he said on Monday"别打电话跟我说这课有多棒＂Don't call me to tell me how wonderful it was而是告诉我你开始变得不一样了"Call me and tell me what you are doing differently.＂在他和世界上最成功 最出色Because in his 65 years of experience working with the most successful最聪明的人the most inspiring一起合作的六十五年间the best and the brightest people in the world他发现这才是能让人what he's found that this is what extinguishes real一直保持愉悦平和的原因lasting change from a temperate high不要告诉我这课有多棒Don't tell me how wonderful it was告诉我你周一做了什么改变Tell me what you are doing differently on Monday从现在开始进行行为转变Introduce behavioral changes now这就是改变的核心This is the core of change你们在这门课上学到的只是开始What you learned in this class hopefully is only the beginning仅仅是开始only the beginning回忆下在Carlton的研究中because remember once again Carlton's study成功的人 最快乐的人The people who succeed, the most who are the happiest就最成功地实现了终极目标succeed the most in the ultimate currency从长远来看 他一生都在学习in a long term ones who are lifelong learners永远在问问题 永远探索always asking questions, always finding out more有很多人都有很好的意图But there are many people with good intentions很多人都有很好的意图many people with good intentions但很好的意图还不够but good intentions are not enough我们需要的还有基础What we also need is the foundation实用的 严格的the empirical, rigorous科学的基础来起作用scientific foundation of things that work当我们了解这些东西后And when we know these things再将它们传递出去then we pay them forward和他人分享then we share them在很多人文及社会的学科中 包括心理学In psychology among other social sciences and sciences in humanities"你在哈佛收获了什么 得到了什么""What you got here at Harvard? What are you getting here at Harvard?"就是这样一种基础is that foundation that can来使世界变得更美好that can make the world a better place我教这门课不仅因为觉得它有趣I don't teach this class only because it is fun for me它确实很有趣 我觉得很愉快it is fun; yes, it is very pleasurable to me我说过我总是等不及到周二和周四I told you I can't wait for Tuesdays and Thursdays来和你们分享我最关心的东西to share what I care about the most with you是很有趣Yes it's fun但我教这门课不仅仅因为这个But I don't do it just because of that更因为我认为一些伟大心理学家的想法I do it because I think the ideas of  some of the greatest psychologists我引用过 也讨论过的that I have quoted and cited and discussed他们的想法能使世界变得更好their ideas can change the world for the better1954年时Maslow写道Maslow back in 1954 wrote:"我不仅是对纯粹的冷漠真理＂I am not only the disinterested and impersonal seeker公正客观的探索者for pure cold truth for its own sake我也很有兴趣关注人类的命运I am also very definitely interested and concerned with man's fate其结局 目标以及未来with his ends and goals and with his future我想帮助人类进步 改善其前景I would like to help improve him and better his prospects我希望教会他如何友爱他人I hope to help teach him how to be brotherly和平互助 勇敢坚毅 正直公平cooperative, peaceful, courageous我认为科学是达到这个目标最大的希望and just, I think science is the best hope for achieving this而在所有学科中and of all the sciences我认为心理学是最有潜力的I consider psychology most important to this end事实上我有时觉得Indeed, I sometimes think世界要么被广义的that the world will either be saved by psychologists心理学家拯救in the very broadest sense要么就无法被拯救"or else it will not be saved at all.＂广义的心理学家In the broadest sense of psychologists这并不意味着It doesn't mean that01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:52,400你现在就应该去读个心理学的博士you now have to go on and get a PHD in psychology或潜心研究心理学or to concentrate in psychology而是要时刻意识到But it means to be constant cognizant了解你大脑中发生的一切to be self aware of what is going on in here这宇宙中最令人惊异的实体the most wondrous and amazing entity in the universe了解它发生的一切to understand what's going on here周围环境以及你的心and there, and here它们是如何联系在一起的and how they are connected并作为现实理想主义者来分享它and to share it by being practical idealists你们可以有影响And you can make a difference你们可以有影响You can make a difference每个人都有不可思议的力量Because the one has incredible power还记得吗 如果你让三个人微笑Remember if you make three people smile他们会让另外三个人微笑and they make three other people smile如此20次后 就能传到地球上每一个人After 20 interations you'll touch every single human being on the planet快乐是会传染的Happiness is contagious我再展示最后一段关于幸福快乐如何传染的录像Let me show you one last video of how happiness and joy is contagious爸爸要惹你们笑了 准备好了吗Dad is going to make you laugh now.
