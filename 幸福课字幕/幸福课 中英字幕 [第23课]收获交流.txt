So I ask someone to say it for me
(录像:大青蛙布偶秀"道别")
[VIDEO: THE MUPPET SHOW ＂Saying Goodbye＂]
挥手道别
Saying goodbye
扬帆启程
going away
"再见"一词哽塞在喉
Seems like goodbye's such a hard thing to say
00:03:57,800 --&gt; 00:04:00,700
双手紧握
Touching our hands
想问为何
wondering why
又是别离时分
It's time for saying goodbye
Kermit
Kermit!
再见
Goodbye!
再见
Goodbyyyyyyyye!
挥手道别
Saying goodbye
满心伤悲
why is it sad?
又回忆起过去的好时光
Makes us remember the good times we've had
千言万语
Much more to say
欲言又止
foolish to try
又是别离时分
It's time for saying goodbye
不舍离开
Don't want to leave
你我都懂
but we both know
有时离开也许更好
Sometimes it's better to go
而我知道
Somehow I know
终会重逢
we'll meet again
虽不知何时何地
Not sure quite where and I don't know just when
你永在我心
You're in my heart
重逢之前
so until then
又是别离时分
It's time for saying goodbye
而我知道
Somehow I know
终会重逢
we'll meet again
虽不知何时何地
Not sure quite where and I don't know just when
你永在我心 重逢之前
You're in my heart so until then
带着微笑
Wanna smile
也噙着泪
Wanna cry
与你道别 啦啦啦啦
Saying goodbye~~~La la la la
啦啦啦啦
la la la la
又是别离时分
It's time for saying goodbye
啦啦啦啦
La la la la
啦啦啦啦
la la la la
啦啦啦啦
La la la la-la la la
我需要你们的帮助
So I need your help
我十分紧张
I'm so very nervous
我该怎么办
What can I do?
冥想? 谢谢
Meditate? Thank you
锻炼 现在?
Exercise? Now?
你是说跳舞吗
You mean dance? OK
讲个笑话
Tell a joke
你们给我讲吧
You tell a joke
还有什么别的建议没
What else? Any suggestions?
拥抱 好主意
Hug someone! Good idea
至少要12个拥抱 对吧
At least 12 hugs, right? Yeah
还有什么 深呼吸 很好
Anything else? Deep breath! OK. Good
紧张也没关系? 谢谢
So it's OK to be nervous? Thank you
我已经感觉好多了
Feel better already
这是我在哈佛的最后一节课了
So this is for me the last class at Harvard
还有谁也是一样
Who else is in the same boat?
你的最后一节课
Wow. Your last class
我今天想做的是
What I'd like to do today is
尽可能地总结一下我们一路来
summarize what we've gone through some of the journey
所得的一些收获
as much as possible
我想和你们分享
And what I'd like to do is to share that
这个总结的责任
the responsibility of summarizing
你们也要一起分享
to share it with you
所以我想从你们思考和回忆课程内容开始
so I'd like to start with you thinking and reflecting about the course
换言之我们今天这节课
In other words, we are going to run the class today
就像个亲密互动环节
like a small intimacy section
之后我会讲一遍我认为的
Afterwards I'll go through what I think of some of the highlights
这学期的一些重点知识
main points from the semester
我想先从你们开始
So I want to start with a time-in
给你们机会回顾一下
an opportunity for you to reflect
我尤其希望你们能够回顾
And specifically I would like you to reflect
以下主题 并把它们写下来
on the following things and actually write them down
翻阅一下你们的笔记 搜索一下脑海
So go over your notes or go over your mental notes
写下至少两样你觉得这学期最有意义
and write down at least two things that were particularly meaningful
或你觉得最有趣的东西
or interesting for you from this semester
不管是课上听到的内容
whether it's something that you heard in lecture
小组讨论时的话题
something you discussed in section
你阅读时读到的东西
something that you read
课后你和朋友讨论过的
something that you talked about with your friends after class
和这门课有所联系的问题
and somehow was connected to your experience here
什么都可以 至少两样对你来说最有意义
anything or at least two things that were personally meaningful
或最有趣的东西
and interesting to you
这是第一个内容
So this is the first thing
我想让你们写下的第二个内容
The second thing that I'd like you to write down
你们可能以前试过
and you may have done it before
可能以前写过
You may have written it before
至少两样你所决心做的转变
at least two commitments that you are making
两种行为转变或态度转变
two behavioral changes or attitudinal changes
两样你要付诸实施的改变
two commitments that you are taking upon yourself
既然学期也都快结束了
now that the semester is almost over
再说一遍 至少两样有意义或有趣的事
So again, two meaningful or interesting ideas at least
以及至少两个转变
and at least two commitments
不管是建立习惯
whether it's in the form of rituals
态度转变 或行为转变
attitudinal change or behavioral change
花一点时间把它们写下来
So take just a few minutes to do that in a time-in
好
OK
现在我希望你们做的 当然是完全
Now what I'd like you to do - and this is completely voluntary
自愿的
of course
就是分享一些你们学过的
is share some of the things that you've learned
或至少一样这学期学过的有意义
or at least one thing that you learned that was personally meaningful
或很有趣的东西
or interesting to you from this semester
以及如果你们愿意的话
and if you feel comfortable
那两样转变其中的一样
the one of the two commitments
或两样一起分享给
or both commitments that you've taken upon yourselves
你身边的那位同学
with the person next to you
或你身边的两位同学
or with two people next to you
花五分钟来彼此分享一下
So take just 5 minutes to share with one another
一样有趣或有意义的事
one interesting or meaningful thing
以及一到两种转变
and one commitment or two
好
OK
我希望你们在今天或人生中
I hope you continue the rest of your day
余下的时间还能继续分享学过的知识
for the rest of your life sharing what you've learned
正在学的知识
what you are learning
你如何成长
how you are growing
我现在想做的是
Now what I would like to do is
听听你们讲讲一样
hear some of you just talk about you know one thing
你认为它
perhaps that you find
有趣或有意义的事
found interesting or meaningful
可以是课堂内容 也可以来自其他涉猎
that could be directly from the class or something tangential
但却是这学期对你来说有趣或有意义的东西
but what was meaningful or interesting for you this semester
我们把话筒在整个教室传递
And we have some microphones spread around the room
有没有人愿意做第一个自愿讲讲的
So if anyone would like to be the first one, to volunteer
还记得吗 勇气并不是没有畏惧
remember courage is not about not having fear
而是有了畏惧还坚持向前
it's about having fear and going ahead anyway
如果勇气是没有畏惧
If courage was about not having fear
我就不会来教这门课了
I would not be teaching this class
Elizabeth
Elizabeth
我觉得对我来说最重要的东西就是
I think for me what the most important thing was was the idea
自我和谐的目标
of self-concordant goal
不是浮躁或自私的
not being frivolous or selfish
而是一种每个人都应该
but actually being something that
积极追求的 可以帮助你身边的人
one should actively pursue and can help the people around you
而非别人让你追求什么 你就追求什么
more than by pursuing that what you are told to pursue
很好 消除自我和他人之间的分歧
Great. So essentially dissolving this divide between self and the other
还记得吗
And remember
达赖喇嘛 当他到了西方国家后有多惊讶
the Dalai Lama - how surprised he was when he came to the west
他听说我们的"同情"这个词
and he heard our word for compassion
指的是对其他人的同情
means essentially compassion toward others
而藏语中Sawai既指对他人的同情
whereas Sawai in Tibetan means compassion toward others
也包括对自我的同情
and compassion toward oneself
它们是彼此交融的
They go hand in hand; they are intertwined
所以要找到自我和谐的目标
So identifying our self-concordant goals
很大程度上就是要帮助自我
is very much about helping ourselves
并最终使世界变得更美好
and ultimately making the world a better place
非常好 谢谢你
Wonderful. Thank you
我觉得Roger Bannister对我来说很有意义
I found the Roger Bannister story really meaningful to me
尤其因为我现在明白了一切皆有可能
especially because now I know nothing is impossible
即使科学家说有些事是不可能的
even there are scientists telling you things are impossible
你也还是可以做到的
You can still achieve them
对 人们经常会跟说 这是不可能的
Right. You know so often people tell us that it's impossible
你做不到
you can't do it
我们的脑海中总是回响着这样的声音
And we have that voice at the back of our mind
这些狭隘的想法
those limiting beliefs
这种狭隘既包括对我们的感觉
whether it's limiting beliefs about how we can feel
也包括我们所能做到的事
can feel; and what we can achieve
而Roger Bannister的故事
And what Roger Bannister's story does
能够帮我们打破一些这样的束缚
what it helps us do is chip away some of these limitations
挖掘自身的潜能
and understand our potential
谢谢你 请说
Thank you. Yes
那天你提到了关于你祖母的故事
The day when you told the story about your grandmother
她是如何历经坎坷后 终于看到
and how she was able to still see so much beauty in the world
世间种种美景的
after everything she had been through
这深深地打动了我
was very, very moving for me
在这样的学术氛围中能如此感动
And that was a very unique experience to
实在是一种特殊而难得的体验
be so emotionally moved in this academic setting
真的很有力量
So that was really powerful
也使我重新审视自己
And that really made me reevaluate the way
看待人生的方式以及
I look at my life and the way that
珍惜我所有的东西的方式
I appreciate the things that I have
谢谢 谢谢
Thank you, Thank you
我很喜欢那个"我们忘记坏事情
I really like the idea that we can get over things
比我们想象的快得多"的观点
bad things a lot quicker than we would anticipate
我经常思考这一点
I just think that you know so often
我们总是骗自己说有多成功
we cheat ourselves of so much success
多么有潜能 多么快乐
so much potential, pleasure
但我想
but I think, you know
朝着目标向前冲
just the idea of going forward and
就算没能达到也会最终释怀的想法
that we will ultimately get over it if it doesn't work out
是非常重要的
That's really important
没错
Right, yes. So you know
我们有所成就时
just like when we achieve something good
能回复平和 感觉就像从前一样
we go back to base level and feel like as we did before
而当我们失败时
also when we fail
要是知道我们是能重新振作的
And it's a real liberating feeling to know that
是会很快恢复的
that we are resilient
249
是很能让人解脱的
that we will recover
谢谢
Thank you
请说
Yes
在我看来 找到竞争主义者和享乐主义者之间的
For me, it was important to realize balance between the rat racer
平衡点很重要
and the hedonist
以及短期益处和长期益处之间的平衡
finding the balance between short term benefit and long term benefit
是的
Right. You know
人生经常会遇到"非此则彼"的情况
so much of our lives is about ＂either or＂
要么我是个成功的竞争主义者
Either I'm a successful rat racer
要么就是个放弃成功的享乐主义者
or I'm a hedonist who has given up essentially on success
而我们其实通常都能将两者融合
Whereas what we can very  often do is reconcile the two
就像咬一口蛋糕还保持其基本完整
You know, eat the cake and leave it whole - so it seems
长远益处和近期益处的结合
Future benefit and present benefit in one
谢谢
Thank you
被人所知而非被证明 以及你教课的方式
To seek to be known and not validated - and the way you taught the class
比如上课前会讲
opening up, let's say
你人生中经历的许多失败
each individual failure you had in your life
我就觉得自己
I found myself
我自己的失败 它们是不同的
my own failures - they are different
但又是统一的
but they are the same
我觉得没那么孤单了
I felt less lonely
谢谢 你知道吗
Thank you. You know when
我在第一节课就讲过的 Carl Rogers说过
what I shared at I think the very first class here was what Carl Rogers said
"最个人的也是最大众的"
which is ＂what is most personal is most general＂
因为从本质来说 这些都是人性
Because deep down humanity is humanity, is humanity
当我们活在这世上 有被了解的欲望
And when we live in the world with the desire to be known
表达自我
expressing ourselves
这是我们最能和他人触碰的时候
that's I think when we can reach out most to others
不管是爱情
whether it's in a romantic relationship
友情
whether it's in friendships
或是同学之间
whether it's in a classroom
谢谢
Thank you
请说
Yes
我从这门课上学到的一点就是
One thing I would take away from this class is
要学会感恩
to be conscious about being grateful
因为有时我感觉
because sometimes I feel that
人们总是把最爱的人当做理所当然
you take for granted the people you love the most
感恩 我们的周围和内心
To be grateful - there are so many treasures of happiness
都有那么多快乐和幸福
of well being all around us and within us
最重要的是睁开我们的双眼
And the challenge is just to open our eyes
去感受它们
to appreciate them
请说
Yes
对我来说特别棒的就是
What was really amazing to me
这门课对其他不是学生的人很开放
was how open others where not in the class
比如家人以及其他不学这门课的同学
such as family and other friends not in the class
同样也能这样改变他们的人生
to also take on this change in their life
他们并不会刻意感觉到这对他们有好处
They didn't see it as some cookie self-help thing
而是
but really as
"对 也许我该记下所有
＂Oh yeah, maybe I should take note of
我生活中该感恩的东西" 以及其他的
all the things I'm grateful for in my life＂and other exercises
是的
Yeah, you know
这就是传递
this is paying it forward
有时我们很害怕说出自己看重的东西
Sometimes we are so afraid to talk about things that matter to us
而当我们说出它时
And when we do
当我们是真实的
and when we are real
当我们是真挚的
when we are genuine
当我们表达自我时
when we express ourselves
这些东西是会传染的
these things are contagious
我们会将其传递出去
And we pay it forward
它们再继续不断传递
And then they pay it forward
谢谢 请说
Thank you. Yes
在学这门课之前
Before taking this class
我将自己的悲喜都归咎于周围的事物
I blame my mood and my happiness a lot on those going around me
比如我的环境
like my circumstances
学这门课真的帮到我很多
So taking this class really helped me
意识到周围环境其实并不会掌控你的快乐
aware the circumstances really don't control your happiness level
我应该更积极地了解自己的感受
that I have more than an active role like how I feel
是的
Right. You know
还记得我们讲过
remember one of the things we talked about is that
至少我不认为什么事都能一帆风顺
at least I don't believe that things necessarily happen for the best
有时我们会遇到坏情况
You know there are some times where there are bad circumstances
糟糕的情况
poor circumstances
艰难的情况
hard circumstances
最大的挑战其实是我们如何
the challenge though is how can we make the best
能更好地利用发生的一切
of that which have happened
我们确实比自己想象的更有力量来掌控
And we do have much more control over it than we think
请说
Yes
这门课让我几乎每天都能很多次地
The class allowed me so many times during almost every day
感受到我是个普通人
to understand something is part of me being human
00:26:27,800 --&gt; 00:26:29,600
我允许自己为人
as part my permission to be human
而不是自己臆想出来的
rather than conceive it as my feelings
或者总想着我没做好的事
or something that I wasn't doing well enough
允许为人
So the permission - you know
我反复多次提到了它 并将继续提到
I've repeated it for so many times and I'll continue to repeat it
即使到了生命最后几分钟也会继续
until use every last minute that I have to do it
因为从很多方面来说它确实是幸福的基础
because it's really on so many levels the foundation of well being
不幸的是我们如今的文化
And unfortunately too much in our culture today
过于强调我所说的
what is going on is what I call
"巨大的骗局"
＂the great deception＂
我们认为每个人都很棒 就我不行
where we think well everyone is doing great except for me
所以我要假装我也很棒
So I'm going to pretend that I'm doing great too
然后我们就成了"巨大骗局"的一部分
And then we become part of that great deception
一定要反复强调
reinforcing it
允许为人
The permission to be human
请讲
Yes
关于完美主义的那些内容
The whole piece about perfectionism
我从没觉得自己是个完美主义者
I have never seen myself as a perfectionist
我觉得那是种自我否定
and I think it's just kind of self denial
通过课堂上的练习以及
So through the exercises in the course as well as
课本的内容
you know in the book
我们做的各种阅读 真的使我
different readings that we've done have really allowed me to
去探索 去接受它
explore that, and accept that
并主动地作出改变来远离它
and make proactive changes in my life to grow away from that
很好 完美主义同样是人们经常隐藏的
Great. You know perfectionism is again another thing that so many people hide
因为完美主义者从定义上说就不愿意显露出弱点
because perfectionist almost by definition doesn't want to show the weakness
正如我在课上所说的
And as I mentioned in the class
我认为不完美主义是在向着
unperfectionism for me has been the most important
幸福前进的道路上最重要的一点
in terms of my progression toward becoming happier
接受不可避免的失败
Accepting failure as an inevitable
接受人生不会是一条直线
accepting that life is not a straight line
而是有起有伏的螺旋
but rather a spiral with ups and downs
但主轴仍然在
along with the general trajectory
也就是进步 成长 和允许为人
as improvement, growth and permission
我觉得最有共鸣的一点就是
So for me one of the things that really resonated
就是重新构建问题
was the idea of reframing the question
在学期刚开始时
At the very beginning
你讲到消极和积极的研究
you spoke about the fact that there was the 21 to 1 ratio
所得到的21:1的比例
of negative to positive research
对于我这样马上要进行神经生物学研究的人来说
And as someone who will be going into research in neurobiology
能够重建世界观是很有趣的
it was really interesting just reframing of a world view
开始思考
just start thinking of
也许
well perhaps
开始思考对于研究来说什么是最重要的
start looking at what is working in terms of research
我会在自己的学术领域中用到它
And, so I will take that with me into my academics
问题的重要性 问题能创造我们的现实
The importance of questions - questions create our reality
还记得公车上的孩子们的问题吗
Remember the question of the children on the bus
很多人都忽视了
which most people completely missed
年复一年我们在城市中对高危人群
remember years and years of research that was done in the inner cities
进行研究
with at risk population
却总是找不到改善他们生活的方法
where they missed the answer to how can we improve their lives
因为他们没有问出积极的问题
They missed it because they did not also ask the positive question
我很快会讲 这也适用于我们生活的各个方面
And it applies into every area of our lives as I'll talk about soon
请说
Yes
此前我一直是个拖延的人
Before, I always procrastinate
这是我学习中的大问题
That is my big problem for my academic
现在我进步了很多
Now I improved a lot
非常感谢你
Thank you very much
拖延症
Procrastination - you know
70%的大学生抱怨说有拖延症
70 percent of students in universities complain about procrastination
这是个大问题
It's a huge issue
克服它的一种方式
And one of the ways to overcome it
克服它的最好方式就是去做
the best way to overcome it is to just do it
还记得五分钟休息吗
Just start - remember the five minute take-off
那非常重要
That's so important
谢谢
Thank you
请说
Yes
我对我们
I was just really
阅读的Gilbert的作品印象非常深刻
really impressed with the reading that we read by Gilbert
讲的是关于生活中的好运
that was talking about how the good luck in your life
以及你觉得自己置身的美好状态
and the wonderful circumstances you find yourself in
其实都是你自己创造的
are really your own making
通过改变你的外表和衣着
And by changing your outlook and your patterns
你可以每日逐渐改变自己的幸福感
you can really make a difference in your happiness day to day
很多人活着会想
Yeah. You know so many people live lives and think
"这个..."
＂well…＂
要是我没遇到这个人就好了
only I didn't meet that person
要是这种事情没发生在我身上
if only this hasn't happen to me
我就会很幸福的
I would have been happy
要明白这其中很大一部分
And understanding that so much of it is
都是由我们的理解决定的是很重要的
determined by our perception is very empowering
请说
Yes
对我来说最有意义的
What has been most meaningful for me
其实就是这门课的存在
has been in fact that this class exists
有这么多人关心幸福
and that there are so many people interested in happiness
因为在哈佛这样的氛围中
cause you know the culture here at Harvard
我们不一定总有机会来思考这个
we don't always get the chance to really think about it
正如你所说
And as you said, you know it's
你只是提醒我们一些已经知道的事
you are just reminding us what we already know
也让我们知道 我们了解它是正常的
but it's also letting us know that we are not crazy for knowing it
是的
Yeah, we are not
我们并不孤单
We are not alone
我们需要有人提醒 其他人也需要
And we need that reminder and other people need that reminder
通过提醒其他人
And by reminding other people
我们也提醒了自己
we also remind ourselves
谢谢
Thank you
请说
Yes
我觉得是正直的概念
For me it's the concept of integrity
因为我认为我们都是诚实的人
because I think we are all honest people
但就是每天的各种小事情
but it's the little things at times each day
让我们的信仰屈服
when we compromise our beliefs
或者让我们言行不一
or act in a way that doesn't align with how we think we should
这会对我们的自尊造成影响
and that that really takes toll on our self esteem
所以时刻意识到并保持我们的正直
And so the idea of being constantly aware of and maintaining our integrity
能让我们对自我感觉更良好
I think really stands to helps us feel better about ourselves
当我们说真话时
Because when we tell the truth
其实正给自己传递了某种信息
we are communicating a certain message to ourselves
当我们表达自我时
when we express ourselves
我们在给自己传递某种信息
we are communicating a certain message to ourselves
这个信息就是我的话有分量 我有分量
And the message is my words count; I count
当我们表达
When we express
"我很棒"
＂we are good enough＂
无需过分想给他人留下印象
don't need to put on a facade or impress
而这个信息
Then the message
这个自我知觉理论能提升
the self perception theory actually enhances
我们对自身的看法
how we feel about ourselves
更不用说对人际关系的提升了
not to mention that it helps interpersonal communication
也能使世界变得更美好
And the world would be a better place
如果越来越多人能够正直
if more and more people acted with integrity
那么同样自我和他人之间的分歧就会消除
And again, self and others divide dissolves
请说
Yes
你在课堂上和我们分享的
One the the phrases that you shared with us
一句话深深震撼了我
in your lectures that's really impacted me
我事实上已经将其作为了座右铭
and I've actually embraced it as a kind of personal mantra is
"学会失败 或从失败中学习 没有别的法子"
＂learn to fail or fail to learn; there's no other way＂
经过这门课的学习 我意识到
And I kind of realized throughout the course, this class
我曾经是个怎样的完美主义者
what a perfectionist I have been
以及我人生中有多少次
and how much time throughout my life
我的早期回忆一直在折磨自己
my earliest memories have stuck really torturing myself
焦虑 以及对犯错的恐惧
the anxiety and fear of making a mistake
重构这些 真正回头看那些不可避免的
and to reframe that and really look at those inevitable moments
00:33:04,100 --&gt; 00:33:08,800
失败时刻 能成为我前进的动力
where I messed up as you know fuel for moving forward, as opportunities
我面前突然一片开阔
has been wildly liberating
非常感谢你
So I thank you for that
谢谢
Thank you
"学会失败 从失败中学习"的概念
The notion of ＂learn to fail and fail to learn＂
其实也是我的个人座右铭
as you know is my personal mantra as well
它能让人解脱
It's very liberating
在人际关系中
It's liberating within the context of relationship
在学业成绩中
within the context of our academic performance
在一个组织的各个层面中
within the context of an organization on every level
重要的是要知道没有其他更好的学习方法
And it's important to understand that there is no other way to learn
不管是画圆圈或学走路
whether it's to draw a circle or to walk
这只是人生的一部分
It's just part of life
如果我们接受它
And if we accept it
我们就能更快乐
we are much happier for it
谢谢
Thank you
Elizabeth
Elizabeth
对我来说特别有意义的就是
What's really been really meaningful to me in deciding
真正要专心追求的东西
what concentration to pursue
快乐是最终的目的
is the idea of happiness is ultimate currency
要试图消除外界的影响
and trying to kind of eliminate outside influences
认真思考对我来说有意义的到底是什么
and really think about what is meaningful to me
在我所学的东西中什么能让我快乐
and what will make me happy in what I study
谢谢
So thank you
最终目的
The ultimate currency
很多人说美国人
you know many people say about Americans
之所以抑郁水平不断攀升
that one of the reasons why the levels of depression are on the rise
之所以有那么多不快乐的人
one of the reasons why there are so many unhappy people
其中一个原因就是美国人有过高的期望
is because Americans have too high expectations
这是错的
And that's not true
我不同意 研究也不能证明这一点
I disagree with it; and the research disagrees with it
这不是高期望或低期望的问题
It's not about having high versus low expectations
而是正确或错误的期望的问题
it's about having right versus wrong expectations
这适用于很多领域
And it applies to, to many areas
但我们要明白的一点是
but one of the things to understand is that
我们在人生中从何处获得满足
where do we look to gain gratification from our life
是来自下一句赞美
Is it from, again getting the next accolade
下一次升职 或人们说我们有多棒吗
the next promotion or the people tell us how wonderful our concentration is?
还是来自我们想做的事
Or is it from doing what we want to do
换言之我们最终的目的所决定的事
in other words, being determined by the ultimate currency
而最终的目的就是快乐
and understanding that happiness is the ultimate currency?
谢谢
Thank you
请说
Yes
我觉得这整个学期 这一整年
I feel that all this semester and all this year in fact
我都一直在
I have been trying to
要么上课 要么跑向实验室
I have been either going to class or running to lab or
寻找方法来填满我的每一天
just finding some way to fill up every hour of my day
似乎我永远在从一处跑向另一处
And it seems like I'm constantly running from one place to another
似乎我整个人生
And it seems all my life I have been
都在试图填满每一分钟
just essentially trying to fill up every hour of my day
我觉得特别重要的
And I feel what's really important and
我真的学到的就是你所说的
what I really got from this is what you said about
做得少其实是更多
doing less is more
我会很认真地在我接下来
And that's something I'm definitely going to take
在哈佛的三年中将这一点铭记于心
like keep in mind the next three years when I'm here
对 做得少其实是更多
Yeah, less is more
数量会影响质量
Quantity affects quality
我们经常好奇
And we so often wonder you know
"我为什么不快乐"
＂how come I am unhappy?＂
我人生中有这么多美好的东西
I have so many things in my life that are wonderful and amazing
这可能就是问题的一部分
And that could be part of the problem
因为更多不一定意味着更好
Because more is not always better
要把事情简化很难 这是很重要的
Not easy to simplify - that's so very important
非常重要
So very important
请说
Yes
复杂性另一面的简单性的概念
The concept of simplicity on the other side of complexity
我觉得非常奇妙
is so awful for me, because you know
当一个人成长时
when you grow up in life
就会加入各种各样的变量 变得越来越复杂
you add all these variables and it becomes more and more complicated
不能把问题简化是很让人沮丧的
And as a is certain frustration about not being able to simplify
但你说到了复杂的顶点后
But when you say at the top of the complexity
你会发现那种美
is when you realize the beauty
发现简单是出现在复杂之后
realizing that the simplicity comes after complexity
而非复杂之前
not before complexity
而对复杂性的理解
And the knowledge of complexity
那是个非常棒的概念
that's an amazing concept
Oliver Wendell Holmes讲到了
So Oliver Wendell Holmes talks about the simplicity
复杂性另一面的简单性
on the other side of complexity
这适用于不管是... 这门课大部分内容
And that applies whether it's to ideas - and again this class
都是很简单的
most of it is very simple
没有什么特别复杂的概念
And there were no very complicated concepts here
但它们很多都是复杂性另一面的简单
But many of them are the simplicity on the other side of complexity
对个人来说也是一样
Same on the individual level
我们经常会遇到困难 生活很艰难
Very often we go through hardships and our life is so difficult
我们会经历危机 严酷的考验
We go through a crisis, through a crucible
而我们要做的就是明白
And what we need to do to understand
当我们经历了这些复杂 艰难
when we are going through that complexity and hardship
严峻的考验和坎坷起伏之后
and the crucible and the difficulties
另一面就是简单
is that there is simplicity on the other side
通常我们要做的往往就是坚持
Very often all we need to do is hang on
再等待一会儿
Just wait a little bit longer
就会更清楚明了
And there'll be more clarity
00:37:43,300 --&gt; 00:37:45,200
更能成长
more growth
更能进步
more development
最终更快乐
more joy at the end of it
请说
Yes
在传递话筒时
On your passing on the mic
我在想
I was like
"天啊 我不知该说什么
＂Oh my God, I don't really have anything to say
太多人了 我没法做到的"
There are so many people, I will never do that.＂
然后你说勇气不是没有畏惧
And then you said courage is not about fearless
而是有了畏惧还坚持向前
but about having fear and doing it anyway
所以我一下就把顾虑都抛弃了
So I just threw my pack over the wall
就像"给我话筒 我要说!"
I was like＂Give me that mic! I'm gonna do it!＂
而它现在在我手上 我在说话
And it's in my hand and I'm speaking
所以非常感谢
So thank you for that
就是这样
That's what it is about
这就是行为转变
It's about behavioral change
而不是理论 很好
Not in theory. Good
请说
Yes
你前几节课讲了关于匿名的世界
You've spoken in the past few lectures about in an anonymous world
如果一切行为是匿名的 我们会如何生活
and about how we would live if our action is anonymous
我认为知道我们真正想要的并勇敢追求
And I think that knowing what we want and actually pursuing
我们想要的东西是很有挑战性的
what we want is or can be really challenging
甚至是让人畏惧的
even frightening
能够真正了解自己想要的
It just seems like you really know what you want and pursued
并一心追求它
and pursue what you want
我觉得这是非常值得自豪的
And I think that is something to be really proud of
而你确实实践了你所教给我们的东西
And you definitely seem to practice what you preach and teach
因此我对你有着崇高的敬意
And I have enormous amount of respect for you because of that
谢谢
Thank you
谢谢
Thank you
你讲过很多东西
There are many things
但有一样我确实学到的就是
but one thing I'm really learned from this class is
专注于我们真正想做的事
it is important to focus on what we really, really like to do
你在课堂上说过很多次
You said many time in the class
教书就是你的使命
teaching is your calling
我能看得出来你有多热爱教学
And I can see how much you enjoy teaching
这让我很有感触
And it was really inspiring to me
我会记住这一点
So I think I will remember that
并不断寻找我的使命
and I will keep looking for my calling
我真正想做的到底是什么
and what I really, really like to do
谢谢
Thank you
请说
Yes
找到拿着话筒的人
Let's take someone with the microphone
把话筒给你
And we'll get it to you
有人有话筒吗
Anyone has a microphone?
好的
Wait. OK
我以前是个总喜欢逃避问题的人
I used to be the kind of person who like run away from my problems
总是试图忽视问题
and I used to try to ignore them
直到它们消失
until they went away
而现在我不再这样了
And I don't do that anymore
因为我知道如果我不开心
Cause I know that if I'm unhappy
唯一能够解决的人就是我自己
the only person who can do something about it is me
我要做出改变
And I need to make a change
这门课给我了很多这样做的帮助
And this class has given me all sorts of tools to do that
谢谢
So thank you
谢谢
Thank you
我想谢谢你告诉我们承诺的力量
I just wanted to thank you for the idea of the power of commitment
它帮助我找到了工作
because it helped me get my job
一边是我想做的事
you know and something that I want to do
也就是记者 一边是我不太感兴趣的
which is journalism versus something that I wasn't excited about
公共关系
doing which is like PR
我想为此感谢你
So I wanted to thank you for that
因为你使我决定投身其中
because you know I decided to jump into it
抛弃一切顾虑
and throw my pack over the wall
所以我才找到自己想要的工作 谢谢
And that's why I got it. So thank you
事实上
You know
粉丝们好
Hi. Neiman fellows
是的
Yes
我记得你说过当拉伸肌肉时
I remember that you talked about when you stretch a muscle
它会变强
it gets stronger
由此引出"拉伸区"的概念
and brought up the idea of stretch zone
我以前没有意识到当我拉伸自己
And I didn't realize how much stronger I would become
去尝试做一些在我的拉伸区
when I stretch myself and do things that weren't in
和恐慌区里的事时 我有多强大
things in my stretch zone and my panic zone
谢谢你
I just thank you
我觉得这门课对我们很多人来说
because I think this class has really been the road map
就像地图一样指引我们改变 变得快乐
A lot of us have needed to change and becomes happier
谢谢
So thank you
谢谢
Thank you
各位下午好
Good afternoon, everyone
我首先想说你太棒了
I'd like to first of all say you are great. Yeah
我是Milwaukee公立学校体系的一名老师
And also I am a proud educator in the Milwaukee public school system
在座有将来想做老师的吗
Are there any future educators in the room?
"Milwaukee"
＂Milwaukee!＂
你之前讲过的
And what you speak of
Albert Bandura和自我效能理论
as Albert Bandura and the theory of self efficacy
是非常重要的
is so very important
任何对帮助青年成长或教育有兴趣的人
And anyone who is interested in youth empowerment or education
对孩子们有高期望
it's very, very important
是非常非常重要的
No.1 to have high expectations for our children
尤其是有色人种的孩子
especially children of color
作为教育工作者
cause as an educator
我明白Bandura和Dweck想表达的意思
I see what Bandura talks about and what Dweck talks about
对这些孩子来说弱化了的现实
this diminished sense of reality for these kids
为他们创建了一个完全不同的世界
that produces whole other world for them
我想强调并着重突出这一点
So you know I just want to really focus and kind of stress that
很感谢你讲了这个
And thank you for sharing that
对孩子有高期望是很重要的
That's important to have high expectations for children
当然对自己也是很重要的
and for yourselves of course
没错 自我实现预言经常会改变世界
Right. Beliefs in self-fulfilling prophecies so often create the world
我们的以及我们周围的世界
our world and the world of those around us
基于我们的信仰
based on our beliefs
我们再听几位
Let's take a couple of more
然后我再快速总结一下
And I'll do my quick summary
请说
Yes
好的
OK
请讲吧
Go for it
我知道这已经被提到好几次了
I know this has been mentioned a couple times already
但真的很容易将我们的不快乐归咎他人
but it's so easy to blame others for our unhappiness
或他人的行为
or others' actions
甚至我们自己的行为
or even our own actions for our unhappiness
但你说过很多次我们潜意识中
But you've talked so many times about what's going on
发生的事以及
in our own subconscious and how
潜意识的影响
what subconscious may be doing
可能才是阻止我们不快乐 错了
is might actually preventing our unhappiness
阻止我们快乐的原因
preventing our happiness rather
这让我回想起Marva Collins
And it just brought me back to Marva Collins
如果学生做错了什么事
and how if a student did something wrong
她会让他们看一遍字母表说
she made them go through the alphabet and say
这些都是我好的方面
these are all good things about me
我们真的应该尝试去想
And it's really been enlightening to try to think about
我想的是什么 对他人不做什么
how am I thinking what am I not doing to others
或他人对我做什么
or what others are doing to me
但要思考是什么阻止我变成一个更幸福的人
but what am I thinking that's preventing me from being a happier person
很好 谢谢
That's wonderful. Thank you
再听两位同学
Let's take two more
那位同学
So up there
这门课上我印象最深的两样东西就是
I guess two things that really stuck with me from the class is
你放的小宝宝学走路的录像
the little clip you showed of the baby learning to walk
你想表达的是这个宝宝
And just like what you conveyed the idea like this baby
并不知道他为何会摔倒
has no reason to like have a sense of why he's falling down
也不知道他该为此感到羞耻
and it should be anything that he should be ashamed of
这是种很有效的方法让我们知道
And that was just like a very effective way to kind of convey like
我们要学会失败 从失败中学习
we always saying kind of learn to fail and fail to learn
这让我感触良多
That really stuck with me
以及你愿意说出你自己在做
And also your own willingness to describe your own kind of rises
心理学研究时经历的起起伏伏
and falls as you went through your studies of psychology
以及你在剑桥和哈佛的经历
and your experiences at Cambridge and Harvard
你愿意很开诚布公地和我们分享
and just your willingness to be very open about it
这让我感受到
It's kind of empowering like, for me is
我要毕业了 要继续发展
I'm about to graduate and I go forward
并不清楚自己想做什么
kind of maybe don't know what exactly you want to do
会考虑各种选择
and you consider different options
会感受到对失败的恐惧
and obviously that fear of failures
尤其是来自像哈佛这样的地方
especially when you come from a place like Harvard
更是让人倍感压力
is maybe especially xx
而你愿意和我们分享这些经历
You just you are willing to share these experiences and empowering
我就会重新考虑我要做的决定
I feel as I kind of question the choices I am going to make
对此我非常感谢
So I really appreciate that
谢谢
Thank you
请说
Yes
每一天都是美好的
Every day is a beautiful day
对此感恩能够让我们在做自己
And to be grateful for that somehow makes it easier to go out
不喜欢的事时能更轻松
and try to do things that maybe even we didn't like
以及常识其实并不那么人尽皆知
And common sense is not that common
这些都是... 学的很多东西都是我已经知道的
And these are all - a lot of things that I've learned I already knew
但我现在是在哈佛学到的
but now I learned it at Harvard
好的 很好
Great. All right
我们再听一位同学
Let's take one more
我是大四的 马上要毕业了
So I'm senior and I'm leaving
这可能是我在哈佛上的最后一节课
So this is my last lecture class at Harvard
如果我说的东西对于班里的低年级同学
So I apologize if this message seems a little more geared
太过难以接受 我将为此道歉
towards the undergrads in the class
我印象非常深刻的一点是
one of the things that I'm very impressed with
这样一门涉及面广泛的大课
is a large lecture class that is so far reaching
有如此多人想上这门课
as far as the number of people who want to take it
班里的同学各种各样
and the diversity of students in the class
但我想和大家分享的经历就是
But I guess this experience that I like to share is that
我来到这个课堂
I came into this class
我很诚实 必须承认
admittedly because I value honesty I will say I took it
我认为这会是对艰难的大四
because I thought it would be a nice complement
春季学期一个很好的补充
to an otherwise a difficult senior spring
我就想"这应该是门挺好玩的课"
And I thought,＂Well, it'll be nice class to have.＂
在我大二时
And my sophomore year
我有点开始探索自我
I had gone through kind of a self discovery
压抑的生活让我用不同的方式来看待事物
post depression that made me kind of value things in a different way
我当时
So I've been
我有了大二的这些想法
I've been using these lessons that I learned sophomore year
我就想"也许这门课就是多余的了"
And I thought＂Well maybe this class will just be redundant＂
结果后来我又在大四的春季学期
Turns out I went through another really difficult time
经历了艰难的时期
during my senior spring
抱歉
And um... Sorry
我最想和在座的低年级同学分享的
I guess what I'd like to relate to especially the undergrads here
就是如果你是大一的
is that it's very important if you are a freshmen
大二的
if you are a sophomore
甚至大三都不算晚
it's not even too late as juniors
最重要的是搞清楚
it's very important to prioritize
在学校里对你最重要的是什么
what's really important to you at this school
我告诉你们不是论文
And let me tell you it's not the paper
不是讨论的问题
it's not the problem set
不是当你的朋友需要你
it's not getting a full 8 hours sleep
空出一小时时 你却说要保证八小时睡眠
when your friends need your attention for an hour
因为这里的人是最重要的
because the people here matter the most
你以后会想念他们
And you'll miss them
如果你不珍惜现在和他们一起的时光
And if you don't spend time with them now
以后很难再有时间和他们共度
you won't have time to spend time with them later on
这非常重要
So it's very important
搞清楚真正对你有意义的是什么
prioritize what is meaningful for you
和你在学校中真正想做的事
and what you really, really want to do in this school
因为在你不经意间
because before you know it
它就要结束了
it will be over
谢谢你让我铭记这一点
So thank you for helping me remember that
使我的这个学期变得有意义
and making it meaningful semester
谢谢 谢谢你们
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you
现在我来总结一下
Let me summarize
你们刚刚讲到的这些所有东西
All of these things that you already mentioned before
这些不一定是最重要的
these are not necessarily the most important
这些东西
These are the ones that
我无须翻阅笔记就能想到
for me without looking back on my notes came up
首先
First
你所问的问题
the questions that you ask
经常都会决定你所做的探索
will very often determine the quest that you take
如果我们只问消极的问题 比如
And if we only ask the negative questions such as
"为什么这么多人失败"
＂why do so many of these individuals fail?＂
我们就没法看到潜藏在
Then we won't see the potential for greatness
每个人心中的伟大 如果我们只问
that exists in each individual if we only ask
"我的人际关系该怎样改善"
＂How can my relationship be improved?＂
我们就无法看见身边的人
Then we will not see all the wonders and the treasures
所拥有的宝贵财富和奇迹
and the miracle that exist in the person next to us
我们同样要问积极的问题
We also need to ask the positive question
我的人际关系中有什么好的方面
what is good about my relationship?
我的同伴有哪些优点
What is great about my partner?
我自己有哪些优点
What is wonderful about myself?
什么对我最有意义
What is meaningful to me?
什么能使我愉快
What is pleasurable to me?
我擅长什么
What am I good at?
问题会带来探索
Questions start a quest
探索的内容取决于我们
And the kind of the quest they start depends on the quality
所问的问题
of the question that we ask
我们常说信念创造现实
The four minute mile - beliefs create reality
不仅是信念 更宽泛地说
Not only beliefs, but to a great extent
00:50:12,200 --&gt; 00:50:17,800
我们如何理解现实才是最后所得的结果
how we perceive reality is what actually comes true
Marva Collins相信她的学生
Marva Collins believed in her students
相信她的学生 然后奇迹发生了
believes in her students and miracles happen
那些朽木难雕的学生因为信念而成就卓越
Those unteachable ones become extraordinary because of beliefs
还记得John Carlton关于商学院学生的研究吗
Remember John Carlton's study once again about business school graduates
将卓越和平庸划分开的有两样东西
Two thing distinguish the extraordinary from the rest
一个是他们总在问问题
One was that they were always asking question
总想学习到更多
always wanting to learn more
心怀谦逊 对成长 幸福和自尊
having that humbleness that's so important for growth and well being
尤为重要
and self esteem
其次
And second
他们相信自我
they believed in themselves
他们有自信
They had the confidence
他们有自我效能通往成功和进步
They had the self efficacy to succeed and to thrive
我们如何提升信念?
How do we improve the belief?
通过拉伸自我 去尝试
By putting ourselves on the line, by coping
挑战自我
by taking risks
通过具象化使我们明白自己可以做到
by showing ourselves that we can do it through visualization
成功没有捷径
There are no short cuts to success
学会失败 从失败中学习
Learn to fail or fail to learn
历史上很多成功的杰出人士
It is no coincident that the most successful
同样也是那些失败最惨重的人
extraordinary people in history were also the ones
这并非巧合
who failed the most
无论是在体育界 Babe Ruth
whether it was in sports, Babe Ruth
比同时代任何球员三振出局次数都多
who struck out more than any other players of his time
但也打出过最多的全垒打
but also hit the most home runs
还有Michael Jordan
whether it was Michael Jordan
一次次地表现出失败
who described his failures time and time again
赛点时最后一个绝杀没有投进
whether it's taking the game winning shot where he didn't make it
或不断重复的机械训练
or practicing over and over and over again
Thomas Edison 比任何科学家
It's no coincident that Thomas Edison
获得专利都多的人
the person who had more patents
同样也是失败过最多次的人
than any other scientist in history
这也并非巧合
is also the scientist who had failed the most times
还记得Dean Simonton对科学家和艺术家的研究吗
Remember Dean Simonton's work on scientists as well as the artists
最成功的往往是失败得最多的
The most successful ones were also the ones who failed the most
没有别的方法可以学习
There is no other way to learn
而且如果我们接受这一点
Moreover if we accept this
如果我们接受这种成长的心态
if we accept this growth mindset
而不是Carol Dweck所说的固定心态
as opposed to fixed mindset that Carol Dweck talks about it
我们不仅会更有进步
Not only we will be, improve more
也会更加快乐幸福
we will also be happier
因为这样就不会每次经历都是
because then not every experience is a threat to our ego
对自我 自尊的一种威胁
to our self, to our self esteem
如果我们接受失败是不可避免的
If we accept the failure is inevitable
不管是在人际关系中
whether in a relationship
存在失望和争吵
there are disappointments and arguments
还是在个人生活
or in individual life
或从国家来说
or on a national level
没有完美的国家 没有完美的人
no perfect country, no perfect person
没有完美的组织
no perfect organization
如果我们明白生命是个上升的螺旋
And if we understand that life is about this
而非一条直线
as opposed to about this
我们会幸福得多
we'll be so much happier
冷静得多
so much calmer
并且也更加成功
and paradoxically so much more successful
允许为人 世界上有两种人
The permission to be human - there are two kinds of people
不会经历情感创伤
who don't experience painful emotions
哪两种人
Who are they again?
精神病患者和死人
The psychopath and dead people
我很高兴你们都不是精神病患者 也都活着
I'm so glad none of you are psychopath and that you are all alive
这让这门课好上很多
It makes the class so much better
安全很多
so much safer
你不可能学完这门课后
You are not going to come out of this class
就能一直保持人生平顺
experience a constant high
没人能一直保持人生平顺
No one experiences a constant high
你还会经历坎坷起伏
You are going to continue to have those ups and downs
我希望你们唯一能
The only difference I hope
感受到的区别就是当经历感情创伤时
that you will experience now is that when you experience a painful emotion
你会看着它说
you will look at it and say
"我只是普通人 我很难过
＂Oh, I'm human. It hurts
真希望事情不是这样
I wish it weren't that way
但我接受它
but I accept it
就像接受重力定律一样
just like you accept the law of gravity
因为重力定律是一种物理本质
because the law of gravity is as much part of physical nature
就像感情创伤是一种人性本质
as painful emotion is a part of human nature
允许为人
Permission to be human
在课堂上我们讲了很多种干预
We talked about many interventions that work in this class
大多数干预并不起作用 正如
Most interventions don't work as we've seen
Somerville的研究和其他研究显示的
whether it's with the Somerville study or others
而日记可以
Journaling works
在写东西时 我们在打开内心
When we write, when we open up
不管是写 还是和我们关心的人倾诉
whether it's in writing or sharing with a person we care about
可以是心理咨询师
And it can be a therapist
可以是好朋友 爱人
It can be our best friend, our partner
当我们分享 开放内心时
When we share, when we open up
我们就能建立一种感觉
we are able to make sense
用Antonovsky的话来说就是"关联性的感觉"
create ＂a sense of coherence＂ in the words of Antonovsky
来看待我们生命中的经历
about the experiences of our lives
得到更高层次的快乐
and enjoy higher levels of happiness
这是有用的
It works
我们周围和内心有那么多快乐
There are so many treasures of happiness all around us and within us
而问题在于我们注意到它们了吗
And the question is do we notice them?
还是把它们想成理所当然
Or do we take them for granted?
回忆一下appreciate这个词
Remember the word, appreciate
有两种意思
It has two meanings:
一种是表示谢谢 这是很好的
one is to say thank you for something which is a nice thing to do
人们常说感恩是最高尚的美德
again, sister called the gratitude is the highest of virtues
感激是一件很好的事
It's a nice thing to be grateful
第二种意思也同样重要
The second meaning is no less important
意思是增值
Appreciate means to grow
当我们感激生活中好的方面
And when we appreciate the good in our lives
感激人际关系中好的方面
when we appreciate the good in our relationship
感激我们的伴侣
when we appreciate our partner
朋友 同学
our friends, our classmates
感激我们的国家
when we appreciate our country
这些好处就会增值
the good grows
不幸的是相反的事也会发生
Unfortunately the opposite is also the case
但我们不予以感恩时
When we don't appreciate
好的方面就会贬值
the good depreciates
世上没有完美的人际关系
There is no perfect relationship
没有完美的人 没有完美的国家
no perfect person, no perfect country
最重要的是要关注什么是有效的
The important thing though is to focus on what is working
感激它 它才能增值
Appreciate it so that it appreciates
很多人疑惑自己为什么总是不快乐
So many people wonder why they are not happy
即使他们已经得到了想得到的一切
even though they have all the things that they want in their lives
为什么 因为好东西太多有时也不是好事
Why? Because there can be too much of a good thing
还记得我最喜欢的歌吗
Remember my favorite piece of music?
Whitney Houston的《我将永远爱你》
Whitney Houston - And I Will Always Love You
10分满分
Straight 
第二喜欢的 贝多芬第九交响乐 9.5分
Second favorite: Beethoven's 9th, 9.
在一起播放 就是噪音
Play together - play together: noise
不是19.5分 10分或5分
Not 19.5, not 10, not 
只是噪音
Noise
好东西太多也不是好事
There can be too much of a good thing
要将一切简化说起来容易 做起来难
Easier said than done to simplify
但记住我们说过比物质充裕
But remember that a much better predictor
更能带来幸福的是时间充裕
of well being than material affluence is time affluence
简化 果断坚决
Simplify. Assert yourself
在适当的时候学会说"不"
Say no at times when it's appropriate
弄清楚你究竟
Find out what you really, really
真正想做的东西 然后去做
really want to do with your life and do it
最能预示幸福的是 人际关系
The No.1 predictor of well being - relationships
是最能预示幸福的
The No.1 predictor of well being
你现在和未来所经营的一段
an intimate relationship that you cultivate now and in the future
亲密关系比世界任何事都重要
matters more than anything else in the world
对甚至比问问题更重要
Yes, even more than a problem set
比考试更重要
even more than an exam
比我们有多成功 多被人景仰
even more than how wildly successful we are
更重要得多
and how admired we are
对 成功会使我们的幸福感陡升
Yeah, that will lead to a spike in our well being
而很快又降到基础水平
very quickly will go back to base level
就像获得长期聘用的大学教授
just like the tenure professors went back to the base level
就像彩票中了大奖的人
Just like the lottery winners
那些以为自己
And the highly successful individuals
非常成功的人
who thought they had made it
很快会回到基准水平甚至更低
and went to the base level and below
因为他们不知道什么会让他们更快乐
because they didn't know what would make them happier
这就是一种
Well, this is what can
其中一种让我们更快乐的方法
one of the things that can make us happier
00:58:25,300 --&gt; 00:58:29,500
经营一段感情就意味着为之投入
And to cultivate relationship means to invest in them
向其中投入时间
to put time into them
彼此分享和交流
To share, to open up
就像我们会投入
Just like we would invest
如果我们找到理想的工作
if we found our ideal job, ideal workplace
我们会将自己投入其中
we would start to invest then
人际关系也是一样
Same with relationship
电影总是在结尾时爱情才开始
Remember movies end where love begins
在大屏幕暗下来后继续经营感情
It's about cultivating the relationship after the screen comes down
在日落之后 此时我们的投入
after the sunset - that's where the investment
我们的投入才有了回报
that's where the return of investment comes
思想带给我们的前进是有限的
Our mind can only take us only so far
我很了解积极心理学
You know I know positive psychology pretty well
我实践了所有我教的知识
I apply everything that I talk about here
然而我真的觉得如果
However, I really think that if I was not
我不知道精神肉体联系
cognizant of the body mind connection
并将精神肉体联系应用于我的生活
and applying the body mind connection to my life
我一定没有今天这么快乐
I would be far less happy than I am today
为什么 因为我会屈服于上帝决定的基准水平
Why? Because I would be compromising on my base level God's given
基因决定的基准幸福水平
gene's given level of well being
因为当我们不锻炼时
Because when we don't  exercise
就像打了镇静剂
it's like taking a depressant
我们必须和本性抗争
And we have to fight our nature
和本性抗争是很难的
And it's very hard to fight our nature
提升我们幸福的水平是很难的
It's very difficult to enhance our levels of well being
00:59:55,100 --&gt; 01:00:03,
而同时要和本性抗争则是难以想象的困难
as is to have to also fight against nature is incredibly difficult
还记得灵药吗
So remember the wonder drug
每周锻炼四次 每次半小时
Exercise at least four times a week for 30 minutes
如果可以 如果你有兴趣
If you can, if you are interested
去做做瑜伽或冥想
do some formal yoga or mindful meditation
打坐冥想
sitting meditation
如果不行 那么至少
If not, at the very least
每天深呼吸几次
breathe -breathe deeply a few times a day
三次深呼吸就有显著效果
Three deep breaths can make a big difference
现在就可以试试
Now is not a bad time to do it
睡眠 可能的话八小时或接近八小时
Sleep - when possible 8 hours or somewhere around 8 hours a night of sleep
以及触摸
And touch
抱 拥抱 这个总被忽视的感官却非常重要
Hug, embrace - an underused sense is so important
被了解而非被证明
Be known rather than be validated
我们所有人都需要被证明
And again, all of us have the need to be validated
并不是说要完全去除我们依赖别人的自尊
It's not about getting rid of our dependent self esteem
但更首要的是被了解 去表达
but it is very much about first and foremost being known expressing
而非给他人留下印象
rather than impressing
人生会变得更轻松 更简单
Life becomes so much lighter, so much easier
更让人兴奋
so much more exciting
如果我们能表达自我
when we are about expressing ourselves
被了解而非被证明
Being known rather than being validated
无论是和我们的伴侣
whether it's with our romantic partner
家人 朋友 同事 同学
our family, our friends, our colleagues, our class
这都是在长期人际关系中
the foundation of the growth of intimacy
01:01:45,400 --&gt; 01:01:49,300
亲密和激情增加的基础
and passion in long term relationships
说起来容易做起来难
Easier said than done
这非常重要
It's so important
我想列出前十
Now I tried to have top 
但我做不到 有一个不得不提
but I couldn't. I had to have one more
所以你们要谅解
so you'll have to excuse me
最后一点 能将所有东西整合在一起的一点
The last one and the one that brings together all the others
就是关于转变的内容
on so many levels is the one about change
终于讲到了 你们一整个学期就等着它呢
Finally. You've been waiting the entire semester just for this - well
希望不会辜负你们的期待
was worth the wait I hope
有两种... 事实上有很多种类型
There are two types - I mean there are many types
但有两种类型的学生
but there are also two types of graduates
上过这门课或其他
from 1504 or any other class or workshop
关于获得更高层次的幸福的课
that is about attaining higher levels of happiness
一种是会感觉很愉快
One that at best enjoys a temperate high
或美好的回忆 然后回到基准水平
Or nice memory and goes back down to base level
第二种同样感觉很愉快
And the second that enjoys maybe the same temperate high
虽然不可能持续整个人生
which cannot last our entire lives
但仍然在未来持续增长
but still enjoy continuous growth throughout their lives
其区别 最基本的区别就在于
And the difference, the primary difference
你是否发生了行为转变
is whether or not you introduce behavioral changes
还记得Peter Drucker说过
Remember Peter Drucker - what he said
每当人们去参加他的周末研讨班
whenever people came to him for a weekend - seminar intensive
他周一时都会说
he said on Monday
"别打电话跟我说这课有多棒
＂Don't call me to tell me how wonderful it was
而是告诉我你开始变得不一样了"
Call me and tell me what you are doing differently.＂
在他和世界上最成功 最出色
Because in his 65 years of experience working with the most successful
最聪明的人
the most inspiring
一起合作的六十五年间
the best and the brightest people in the world
他发现这才是能让人
what he's found that this is what extinguishes real
一直保持愉悦平和的原因
lasting change from a temperate high
不要告诉我这课有多棒
Don't tell me how wonderful it was
告诉我你周一做了什么改变
Tell me what you are doing differently on Monday
从现在开始进行行为转变
Introduce behavioral changes now
这就是改变的核心
This is the core of change
你们在这门课上学到的只是开始
What you learned in this class hopefully is only the beginning
仅仅是开始
only the beginning
回忆下在Carlton的研究中
because remember once again Carlton's study
成功的人 最快乐的人
The people who succeed, the most who are the happiest
就最成功地实现了终极目标
succeed the most in the ultimate currency
从长远来看 他一生都在学习
in a long term ones who are lifelong learners
永远在问问题 永远探索
always asking questions, always finding out more
有很多人都有很好的意图
But there are many people with good intentions
很多人都有很好的意图
many people with good intentions
但很好的意图还不够
but good intentions are not enough
我们需要的还有基础
What we also need is the foundation
实用的 严格的
the empirical, rigorous
科学的基础来起作用
scientific foundation of things that work
当我们了解这些东西后
And when we know these things
再将它们传递出去
then we pay them forward
和他人分享
then we share them
在很多人文及社会的学科中 包括心理学
In psychology among other social sciences and sciences in humanities
"你在哈佛收获了什么 得到了什么"
"What you got here at Harvard? What are you getting here at Harvard?"
就是这样一种基础
is that foundation that can
来使世界变得更美好
that can make the world a better place
我教这门课不仅因为觉得它有趣
I don't teach this class only because it is fun for me
它确实很有趣 我觉得很愉快
it is fun; yes, it is very pleasurable to me
我说过我总是等不及到周二和周四
I told you I can't wait for Tuesdays and Thursdays
来和你们分享我最关心的东西
to share what I care about the most with you
是很有趣
Yes it's fun
但我教这门课不仅仅因为这个
But I don't do it just because of that
更因为我认为一些伟大心理学家的想法
I do it because I think the ideas of  some of the greatest psychologists
我引用过 也讨论过的
that I have quoted and cited and discussed
他们的想法能使世界变得更好
their ideas can change the world for the better
1954年时Maslow写道
Maslow back in 1954 wrote:
"我不仅是对纯粹的冷漠真理
＂I am not only the disinterested and impersonal seeker
公正客观的探索者
for pure cold truth for its own sake
我也很有兴趣关注人类的命运
I am also very definitely interested and concerned with man's fate
其结局 目标以及未来
with his ends and goals and with his future
我想帮助人类进步 改善其前景
I would like to help improve him and better his prospects
我希望教会他如何友爱他人
I hope to help teach him how to be brotherly
和平互助 勇敢坚毅 正直公平
cooperative, peaceful, courageous
我认为科学是达到这个目标最大的希望
and just, I think science is the best hope for achieving this
而在所有学科中
and of all the sciences
我认为心理学是最有潜力的
I consider psychology most important to this end
事实上我有时觉得
Indeed, I sometimes think
世界要么被广义的
that the world will either be saved by psychologists
心理学家拯救
in the very broadest sense
要么就无法被拯救"
or else it will not be saved at all.＂
广义的心理学家
In the broadest sense of psychologists
这并不意味着
It doesn't mean that
01:06:47,200 --&gt; 01:06:52,400
你现在就应该去读个心理学的博士
you now have to go on and get a PHD in psychology
或潜心研究心理学
or to concentrate in psychology
而是要时刻意识到
But it means to be constant cognizant
了解你大脑中发生的一切
to be self aware of what is going on in here
这宇宙中最令人惊异的实体
the most wondrous and amazing entity in the universe
了解它发生的一切
to understand what's going on here
周围环境以及你的心
and there, and here
它们是如何联系在一起的
and how they are connected
并作为现实理想主义者来分享它
and to share it by being practical idealists
你们可以有影响
And you can make a difference
你们可以有影响
You can make a difference
每个人都有不可思议的力量
Because the one has incredible power
还记得吗 如果你让三个人微笑
Remember if you make three people smile
他们会让另外三个人微笑
and they make three other people smile
如此20次后 就能传到地球上每一个人
After 20 interations you'll touch every single human being on the planet
快乐是会传染的
Happiness is contagious
我再展示最后一段关于幸福快乐如何传染的录像
Let me show you one last video of how happiness and joy is contagious
爸爸要惹你们笑了 准备好了吗
Dad is going to make you laugh now. Ready?
他们会在怎样的世界中成长取决于你
What kind of world that they will grow into depends on you
取决于你是否首先
And it depends on whether or not you first and foremost
关注了自身
take care of yourself
引用甘地的话
In the words of Gandhi
"欲变世界 先变其身"
＂Be the change you want to see in the world＂
如果想要更快乐的世界 你自己先快乐起来
If you want a happier world, be that change
所有你们去的地方
All the places you will go
我想提醒你们
I would like to remind you
每次你们去一个地方 通常情况下
that every time you go to a place and very often
你都会坐飞机去 这样你每次去时
you will fly to a place that every time you go
都会听到一些会引起你反思
you will hear something that hopefully will trigger
照顾自己有多重要的东西
hopefully will remind you how important it is to take care of yourself
要照顾别人
because to take care of others
你首先要照顾自己
you first and foremost need to take care of yourself
当你坐飞机时
You know when you fly
乘务员会说
and the flight attendant says
以防紧急情况 氧气面罩会脱落
in case of any emergency and the oxygen mask comes down
首先自己戴上 在去帮助需要帮忙的人
first help yourself before you help others who need your help
因为这就是
Because that is the source
黄金法则的基础
the foundation of the golden rule
是更美好的世界的基础
It is the foundation of a better world
