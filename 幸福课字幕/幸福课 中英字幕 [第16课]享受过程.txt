幸福课 中英字幕 [第16课]享受过程
今天有人有消息宣布吗 没有Dr.Tal Ben-Shahar:Any announcement today? Anyone? No.好的 早上好OK.Good morning.我们今天要把完美主义讲完What we are going to do today is finish up on perfectionism然后开始讲精神肉体and then move on to the mind body.这个学期对我来说挺不错的This semester for me has been going great.没有什么东西There are very few things that让我后悔做过I regret about not having done this semester,不过下次我还想挑战点别的but there is one thing that I will change next time教这门课时 我现在知道了when I teach the class,that I already know of now,应该更早讲精神肉体的is have the lecture on the mind body earlier.因为这个话题十分重要Because it is such an important topic.它是如此根本而且基础 因此当我意识到It is so foundational,so basic that when I realized that-在这个学期很早的时候就意识到and that was earlier on this semester that我应该早点讲I should have had it earlier,我那时就开始停止介绍身体锻炼I started already to plug for physical exercise,开始讲"念"的概念to talk about mindfulness,从较低一点的层次来介绍它to introduce it a little bit on a lower level of the spiral.今天 在一两个月之后So today,you know,a month or two- too late perhaps,我们要再讲讲精神和肉体的联系we are going to introduce the mind body connection,身体的健康physical health.首先我们先把完美主义讲完But first,let me introduce- let me finish up on perfectionism.上节课我们讲到了两个模型So remember last time we talked about the two models-完美主义的基模the schema of the perfectionist,一条从A到B的直线a straight line from point A to point B以及追求卓越的基模versus the schema of the person committed to excellence更像是蜿蜒曲折的螺旋上升which is much more meandering spiral kind-of journey.And有些人昨天在办公时间来问我a couple of people yesterday in office hours asked the question,"区别到底在哪里""so what is really the difference?"我们可以用无意义追逐目标的人来类比So you gave us the model of rat racer-还记得那个72岁的人吗you know that person- remember- who at the age of 72,他达到了很高的地位gets to being,quite literally on top of the world,管理着世界的中心overlooking central park在承受了一生的压力and then being informed after a life of constant stress,不停地追逐到达B点constantly living the future in point B,而不是享受当下 享受旅途之后被告知not enjoying the present,the journey,退休的时候到了is being told it is time to retire.我问你们一个简单的问题And I asked you a simple question,"你想要怎样的生活""what kind of life do you want for yourself?"那么另一种模型是怎样的呢 积极的模型是怎样的So what is the alternative model? What is the positive model?积极的模型从外表上看来似乎一模一样Now the positive model from the outside may look exactly the same可能也是一个充满雄心壮志的人It may be a person who is extremely ambitious,极度勤奋刻苦的人a person who is extremely hard working,可能是个投资银行家 或者是个医生a person who is an investment banker or a doctor,或者律师 老师 或者在流浪者之家工作or a lawyer,or a teacher,or working at a homeless shelter.从外表上看可能完全一样It may look the exactly same from the outside.但其内在则是迥然相异From the inside,it is radically different.怎么个迥然相异法呢How is it radically different?区别在于这个追求卓越的人In that the person who is on the excellence side,也许同样充满雄心壮志 有同样的目标may be as ambitious,may have the same goals,也可能达到了同样的目标may reach the same goals.然而这个人同时享受这个旅程However,that person also enjoys the journey.这就是区别所在That is the difference.是的 他或她会进入名校So yes,he or she gets into a top school,进入他们非常想进的学校a school that they really wanted to get into.在学校里他们非常勤奋刻苦And at school they work extremely hard.但同时他们也知道 他们几乎可以However,they also learn it that they are able to,mostly-不是完全 但几乎可以there's no 100 percent here- but mostly,享受他们在学校的所有时光 同样的起伏坎坷enjoy their time in school,with the same ups and downs,同样的兴衰变迁 但他们享受这个过程the vicissitudes- natural- but enjoy school然后获得他们想要的工作and then get into the job they really wanted或者他们想要的工作之一 然后继续努力工作or one of the job they wanted,and work extremely hard there,充满雄心壮志 每周工作80个小时and be ambitious,and work the 80 hour weeks.然而这个人同样享受整个过程However,that person also overall enjoys the journey.然后他们享受下一个旅途 和别人合作And then they enjoy the next step and being associate,成为别人的搭档 当上营销总监之类的being a partner,and being the MD or whatever it is.唯一的区别就在于他们享受这个过程The only difference is that they enjoy the journey.我还可以举出一些实例Now I have a few role models that I know.其中之一就是我的前室友 他是个投资银行家One of them is my ex-roommate,who is an investment banker.我们一起上大学 也是96届的We were in college together,also class of 96.毕业之后 由于其经济学的专业After graduating,being an economist major,给一个著名的对冲基金工作worked for one of the premier hedge funds.之后他就回到哈佛 获得法律博士和工商管理硕士的双学位After that,came back to Harvard,got his JD MBA.学业非常优秀Did extremely well here as a JD MBA.之后就获得了所有他想要的机会Had all the offers that he wanted after.他又选择了另一家对冲基金Chose another hedge fund.之后他又自立门户 和一些朋友一起开了一家公司And went off on his own and started a firm with a few friends.当我和他谈起投资银行时Now when I talked to him about investment banking我对此了解很少which I know very little about,我对投资银行表现得很兴奋I get very excited about investment banking.因为他的兴奋能感染我Because his excitement is contagious.他每天都期待着工作He looks forward to work every day.他工作的时间也很长And he works long hours.他就是一个追求卓越的例子So he is a model of a person committed to excellence.虽然从表面上看Even though from the outside,就和我之前描述的形象it may look the exact same as the "caricature"一模一样that I depicted earlier.因此不是要我们失去雄心壮志So it's not about losing our ambition.也不是变得没有竞争力It's not about not being competitive.如果那能让你快乐的话If that is what makes you happy.这只是让你们学会享受过程It is simply learning to also enjoy the process,00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,430朝着你认为有意义的目的地the step on the way to a destination所迈出的步子才是最重要的that you deem valuable that is important to you.而问题在于 "我们如何克服完美主义Now the question is,"how do we overcome this perfectionism,这个解不开的结呢"this constant knot in our stomach?我们如何克服活在未来中的感觉How do we overcome this living in the future,因为害怕失败而害怕当下的感觉being afraid of the present because what if I fail?我讲了一些方法And I started to describe a few methods:首先是认识它the first one is being aware of it-认识到我想改变什么being aware of what I want to change我想保持什么and what I want to maintain.还记得Ellen Langer的研究吗Remember Ellen Langer's study-关于更确切地了解about getting a more nuance understanding我到底想改变什么of what it is that I want to change.因为长久以来Because for very long time,我都是个完美主义者I couldn't,couldn't become less of a perfectionist因为总是想着完美 总是想着成功because associated with perfectionism,with also success,我的潜意识让我没法摆脱完美主义my subconscious were stopping me from letting go of perfectionism因为我会认为那就意味着because I thought that also means把宝宝和洗澡水一起冲走了 也就是成功被冲走了throwing out baby with bath water,i.e.my success.但现在我更确切地了解了完美主义But now that I have a more nuance understanding of perfectionism它就是一种对失败的无法抑制的恐惧which is an incapacitating fear of failure,我明白了我仍然可以充满抱负and I understand that I can still be as ambitious而无需放弃成功and not give up my success,同时享受这个过程 这是更好的理解and yet enjoy the process- that's a better understanding.这样我就能继续前进And now I can move forward.因此第一步就是认识So the first step is awareness.在我们获得了认识之后After we have awareness,就是Dweck关于工作回报的概念it's about going back to Dweck's notion of rewarding effort.记住Carol Dweck能够在短短几小时内Remember,Carol Dweck was able to change students就改变学生和成人的思维模式and adult's mind set with as little as a few hours.有时候And sometimes,这些思维模式在他们非常小的时候就已经奠定了this mind set has been set in them from a very young age.思维模式是固定的 还是可塑的The fixed versus the malleable mind set.Carol Dweck通过教他们可塑性And Carol Dweck by teaching them the malleability,神经的可塑性 我们的大脑是时刻在变化的the neuroplasticity- how our brain constantly changes通过教他们关注过程 关注所付出的努力by teaching them that to focus on the journey,on the effort,而不是结果 或者最后的成就as opposed to the outcomes,as opposed to the intelligence,从而改变他们的思维模式was able to change their mind set.我们自己也可以关注我们付出的努力So in ourselves we can focus on a reward on our effort,关注过程本身 不管它是失败还是成功on our process,whether it's failure or success.主动地去接受Active acceptance.它将永远是我们的一部分It will always be part of us.完美主义者经常会做的一件事You know one of the things that perfectionist very often do当他们意识到自己是完美主义者时when they realize they are perfectionists,这让他们很难受and that is hurting them:他们就用完美主义的方式来克服完美主义they apply the perfectionist approach to overcoming perfectionism也就是说which means,我会成为一个完美的追求卓越的人I will become perfect person who is committed to excellence.这不会起作用的 只是更进一步的完美主义That doesn't work.That's just more perfectionism.但主动的接受意味着But what active acceptance is about saying,"好吧 我仍旧是个完美主义者"OK.So I'm not...So I'm still a perfectionist.我可能永远都会有这方面的性格I will always probably have part of it in me.这没关系 没有关系"And that's OK.And that's OK."佛教徒会说的一句话是 通常情况下One of the things that Buddhists talk about is that very often,我们面临的最大挑战our greatest challenges,Karen Horney会称之为"神经官能症"what Karen Horney would call "our neurosis"-不管是完美主义 对失败的恐惧whether it's perfectionism,the fear of failure,还是时不时出现的愤怒 焦虑whether it's anger that comes up once in a while,anxiety,不管我们的问题是什么whatever it is that we have- that "issue".佛教徒很巧妙地重新定义了它The Buddhists cognitively reframe it and say,"我们要将其视为一种工具 一种成长的工具"we need to look at it as a tool,as a tool for growth,一种了解自己的方式as a way of learning about ourselves,使我们深入挖掘自己 然后得以成长"digging deep inside ourselves and growing."要这样看它 这是个成长的机会So to look at it- OK,so this is an opportunity for growth,了解自我 反省自身的机会for personal learning,for reflection,能够更设身处地为别人着想的机会 无论它是什么for more empathy toward other people- whatever it is.将其视为一种工具But to look at it as a tool.接受它 然后行动Accept it.And then act.有助教能查查看它到底怎么了吗Can one of the TFs- do you mind seeing what it is,please?谢谢 JohnThanks,John.下一步 在接受它之后 我们就去改变它The next thing,after we accept it,we go ahead and change it.我们要通过建立行为来改变它And we go ahead and change it by introducing behavior.这里的关键在于行为The key issue here is behavior.我上节课讲过的一件我做过的事Now one of the things that I did as I told you last time就是向别人寻求反馈was started to solicit feedback from people,寻求批评started to solicit criticism.一开始我要控制自己不去回答Initially,literally I need to catch myself from responding,不去顶嘴反驳from attacking back.为什么 因为批评是对直线箭头的偏离Why? Because criticism is the deviation from a straight narrow,偏离那个基模from that schema.但我逐渐习惯了 这真的帮到了我But over time I got used to it.It actually helped me.我现在更能够包容批评And now I'm much open to criticism.然而Still,我有时仍会想回答 想顶嘴反驳sometimes catch myself when I want to respond and attack back.但总体来说 我通过改变态度的行为变得更好But overall,I got better through behavior changing attitude.还有一点 使自己更经常处于水平线上Something else- putting myself on the line more,包括我跟你们讲的关于Brittany的故事whether it's the story that I told you about Brittany,连续说了几次不who said no a few consecutive times.但没关系 她说不And that's OK.So she said no.我还在这 我还活着I'm still here.I survived.屡战屡败 屡败屡战Learn to fail or fail to learn.下一步 我们不一定要外在地表现出行为Next,we don't always have to act out in the world;我们也可以在内心中模拟we can also act in our internal simulator-你的思想是无法分辨the mind doesn't know the difference现实和想象的区别的between the real thing and the imaginary thing.因此我可以想象自己 幻想自己And therefore,I can imagine myself,see myself,就像一个追求卓越的人一样acting as a person committed to excellence.比如说在上课之前So for example,before teaching,我想象的一件事就是one of the things that I visualize假想我自己站在台上 感觉很轻松is seeing myself there on the stage,feeling light,冷静 并且很包容 换句话说calm and accepting- in other words,想象追求卓越的人会用的方式a way that a person committed to excellence would,as opposed而非总是害怕失败的完美主义者to a perfectionist would be constantly afraid of failure.你的大脑是不会知道有什么区别的And the mind doesn't the know the difference你的大脑需要一致性and the mind looks for consistency.因此我就能那样去做And therefore,I'm able to be that way或者更容易那样去做 因为我先幻想了or much more likely to be that way because of the visualization.同时冥想也会有所帮助Also,meditation in and of itself helps.我们可能会在周四讲到冥想We'll talk about meditation- probably get to it on Thursday.因为冥想能使我们处于冷静的状态Cause meditation puts us in a state of mind of calm,能够接受事物 是一种存在 而非一种行为of acceptance,a state of being,as opposed to state of doing.当我们作为一种存在时 我们就能活在当下And when we are in a state of being,we are here and now,我们就能享受过程we are enjoying the process,而不是总想着目的地as opposed to constantly thinking about the destination,以及如果我达不到这个目标会怎么样and what will happen if I don't get to that destination.周四我们会更深入地探讨But more on that on Thursday.这是我从Samuel Coleridge那里学来的方法This is a technique,method that I learn from Samuel Coleridge,一个英国的哲学家the British philosopher,活跃于18世纪末 19世纪初late 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century,影响了爱默生的哲学家之一one of the philosophers who influence our Ralph Waldo Emerson.Coleridge本身是个完美主义者And what Coleridge did- he had an issue with perfectionism后来丘吉尔说完美主义and perfectionism as Winston Churchill later on said"就是瘫痪""means paralysis"-他在写作时就经历了这样的"瘫痪"and he experienced this paralysis when he came to writing.写作是他生命中最重要的一件事Writing was the most important thing in his life.但他就是没法写好But he really couldn't write well.因为他很害怕写不出那终极的文章Because he was so afraid of not writing the ultimate essay,或者终极的诗or the ultimate poem.00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:27,030所以他所做的是 他说 "在我生命的结尾So here was what he did: he said,"well,at the end of my life,我会写出我的巨著I will write my magnum opus.在那之前 一切都只是草稿"Until then,everything is rough draft."这让他得到解放And that liberated him.因为他不再焦虑了Because he wasn't worried any more.他再也不用想着写巨著Now he never got to write his magnum opus.而同时 他写出了无数优美的诗篇But at the meantime,he wrote dozens of beautiful poems-有些是英语中最美的文字some of them the most beautiful in the English language以及许多非常强有力的and numerous very powerful,具有影响的 结构精妙的文章influential and beautifully crafted essays.而他们都只是"草稿"And they were all "rough drafts".这样就没有压力了 这给了我很大的帮助So there wasn't the pressure.This helped me a lot.当我想到这个时 我说 "好吧Because what I do when I thought about this,I said,"OK.看看完美主义So let's see one of the domains-对我影响最深的一个领域吧where perfectionism was very strong for me因为这个领域对我很重要 就是教学"because it was an important domain- was teaching."我就对自己说 "好吧" 这是大约十年前的事了Then I said to myself,"OK." And this was close to 10 years ago.我说"二十年后 我会在名列前茅的I said,"in 20 years,I'm going to have a leadership institute学院中任教in which I'm going to be teaching.能开很棒的学术报告和研讨会Amazing workshops and seminars and lectures.在那之前 一切都只是草稿Until then,everything is rough draft.00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,780在那之前 一切都只是准备" 这真的起作用了Until then,everything is preparation." And that took off...我现在知道这是个心理游戏Now I know this is a mental game.我知道我是在骗自己I mean I know I am "fooling myself".因为12年后 等目标要到了的时候Because in 12 years from now,when that goal is actually,20年到了的时候when I'm there 20 years later,我会再定一个20年后的计划I'm going to set another goal for 20 years later.来解放我自己 这样我才能享受当下To liberate me so that I can enjoy the here and now.这样我才能享受过程So that I can enjoy the process,而不是执着于要变得完美as opposed to be stuck on it having to be perfect,毫无半点瑕疵 这是永远无法达到的flawless everyday experience,which it can never be.因此制定一个终极目标可以让你解放So end goal can often be liberating.这是铂金法则The Platinum Rule.黄金法则就是So the Golden Rule:"己所不欲勿施于人"do not do unto others what you would not have done unto yourself"或者说"己所欲方施于人"Or "do unto others what you would unto yourself."这是当今很多道德体系和宗教信仰的基础The foundation of most moral systems,most religions today.铂金法则就是取自黄金法则The Platinum Rule is taking the Golden Rule再对其进行小小的修饰and switching it around.它说的是And what it says is,"人所不欲勿施于己""do not do unto yourself what you would not do unto others."或者说"人所欲方施于己"Or rather "do unto yourself what you do unto others."如果你的一个好朋友 你非常在乎的一个人Now if a good friend of you,someone you really care about或者家庭成员失败了 没做好or a family member fails and doesn't do well,你会怎样对待这个人 你会排斥这个人吗what you'll do with that person? Do you reject that person?"你考试只得了个B""Oh you just got a B on this exam."或者"你竟然没赢得比赛"Or "you didn't win this competition."你会这样对待他们吗 还是你会拥抱他们Is that how you treat them? Or do you embrace them?你们会因此少爱他们一点吗 当然不会And do you love them any less for it? Of course not.那么为什么我们要将这些不现实的Then why do we apply these unrealistic毫无共鸣的标准强加给我们自己呢and non-compassionate standards to ourselves?达赖喇嘛Now the Dalai Lama,当他刚开始大量接触西方文化时when he was first introduced to a lot of Western culture,被一样东西困扰了was baffled by one very particular thing:就是我们用的一个词 同情by our usage of a word,compassion.同情这个词在藏语中叫"tsewe"The word compassion in Tibetan is "tsewe",拼为"t-s-e-w-e"in English spelled "t-s-e-w-e".这个词在藏语中的意思The word in Tibetan means既是同情他人 也是同情自己compassion for others as well as for self.所以他完全被英语中的概念搞糊涂了And he was really taking back by the notion that in English或者说在大多数西方文化 不仅是英语文化中when we talk about,or in West in general- not just in English-当我们说到同情时when we talk about compassion,我们是指对别人的同情we talk about compassion for others.他说"你们对自己没有同情And he said,"how can you have compassion for others又怎么能对别人有同情呢"when you don't have compassion for yourself?"自我是基础The foundation is the self.铂金法则The Platinum Rule就是说对我们自己也要有同情is about having compassion for ourselves as well.对待自己不能不同于对待别人Not treating ourselves differently than we would others.288要有同样的标准Holding...Having similar standards.要像接受别人 我们所爱的人的失败一样 去接受Accepting failure in the same way that we accepted in others,我们自己的失败in people we love.为什么不呢 我们是如何帮助别人的After all,why not? How do we help other people?因为通常我们处于一段感情中时Because very often when we are in relationships,和完美主义者有感情的人people are in relationships with a perfectionist or,或者我们有个朋友是完美主义者的话we know a friend of ours is a perfectionist,我们如何去帮助别人how do we help other people?首先要搞清楚的一件重要的事就是The first thing that is important to make very clear is that帮助别人是非常困难的it is extremely difficult to help other people处理完美主义的问题deal with perfectionism.通常都要从内部着手It mostly has to come from within.他们必须要渴望改变They have to want a change.因为这是需要时间的Because it takes time.不是立竿见影的Doesn't happen over night.我从研究中 或者个人经历中了解到这一点I know it from research or I know it from personal experience.但我们还是能去帮助他人 即使知道这很困难And yet,we can help,after accepting that it is difficult.首先最重要的事就是树立榜样The first most important thing to do is by example.如果我能改变If I can change,成为一个追求卓越的人and become more a person committed to excellence,享受过程 即使失败也要庆祝enjoy the journey,celebrate even failures,即使偶尔挫折也要庆祝even falling down once in a while.那我就做出了榜样Then I'm leading by example.还记得那个实验吧And remember that experiment,right?人们更愿意照着你所做的去做 而不是你说的话People do what you do,rather than what you say.第二件事就是分享这个故事Second thing to do is to tell stories about it,也就是这门课which is what this lecture is essentially,上两节课所讲的内容the last two lectures were about-基本上是关于我个人如何从mostly,personal stories of how I moved or am moving完美主义者变为追求卓越者的故事from being a perfectionist to being committed to excellence.讲故事 互相分享So telling stories,sharing.再次强调分享和讲的区别Again,the difference between sharing and telling:分享 两者皆有收获 讲就只是单行道sharing,both of us get; telling is one way street.最后还有一种帮助别人的方式And finally,another way to,to help other people回忆一下Carol Dweck的研究is remembering what Carol Dweck was all about.工作回报 过程的回报Rewarding effort.Rewarding the journey.很容易陷入对结果的回报之中It is so easy to fall into the track of rewarding outcome,也很容易忘记回报过程and so easy to forget to reward the journey.我在抚养我的小孩时就觉得很困难I know that's difficult in child rearing with my kids.在感情之中也很难做到And it's certainly difficult in a relationship.作为上司或者朋友当然也很难It's certainly difficult being the boss or a friend.但一定要注意回报过程But to really focus on rewarding the journey,要指出来"这是个不错的尝试"on pointing out "oh this was a great attempt"或者"这真是太有趣了" 注重过程or "this was so much fun doing it"- the process.我想通过做一个I want to end this lecture对至今为止所讲内容的小小总结来结束这个话题by introducing a mini summary of the course so far.这是个技巧 一个很简单的技巧This is a technique- quite a simple technique,但我发现是个很有用的技巧but a technique that I found very powerful.因为它能够整合我们目前为止所见过的Because what it does is synthesize a lot of what we discussed所有内容until now in the course.00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:16,170我将这个技巧应用于各种困境中And this specific technique I apply to difficult situations当我在面对人生中很困难的一段时期 可能是很长的一段时期when I'm facing periods in my life and it could be a long period也可能是很困难的一天时or one day that is very difficult for me.当我感受到焦虑或压力You know,when I'm experiencing anxiety or stress,或者深深的失望时or strong levels,or high levels of disappointment.343这是除了三个M之外的另一种选择And this is the alternative in many ways to the three Ms-还记得三个M吗 放大 减小so remember the three Ms? Magnifying.Minimizing.以及编造 发明And Making-up,inventing.三个P则是另一种选择So the three Ps are the alternative.第一个P就是准许自己为人The first p is the Permission to be human.如果我经历了困难So if I experience a difficult experience,I have some...我遇到了挫折I go through a hard time.第一步就是给自己许可证The first step is to give myself permission也就是说接受这样的感情and that would mean accepting of the emotion,接受这个困境 接受现实accepting that is difficult,accepting reality.它已经发生了Something just happened;我对此什么也做不了there is nothing I can do about what had just happened.能够改变的只有我对它的诠释What can change is perhaps my interpretation of what had happened这时我就会进入下一个层次which is where I get to the next level.到下一步The next step.也就是重建 将情况诠释为积极的And this is reframing,interpreting the situation as Positive.这就是积极者And that would be the benefit finder.这其中有什么闪光点What's the silver lining here?其中有什么成长的机会What is the growth opportunity here?所以如果我经历了困境So if I am going through a very difficult time,也许可以用佛教的眼光来看待perhaps look at it through the Buddhist perspective and say,"这是成长的工具"well,this is a tool for growth;这可以帮助我更好地了解自己 了解他人this will help me better understand myself as well as others,成为一个更好的心理学家 成为一个更好的商人become a better psychologist,become a better business person,诸如此类whatever it is.再次发掘出失败中的闪光点 失败中的机会Seeing it again,the silver lining,the opportunity in failure.最后And finally,我们没怎么提到的一个非常重要的技巧one very important technique that we didn't talk about much,就粗略提到过的 就是分心just in passing,is distracting,distraction;将注意力转向别处is looking toward other place.这不一定是件好事It's not always good.In fact,我们下节课会讲到 有时执着于we will talk about next time it's sometimes detrimental to stay分析每种情感 感觉和想法 是有害的and analyze every single emotion,feeling,thought that comes up.反复思考并不一定有帮助Ruminating in and of itself does not always help.有时最好的方法Sometimes the best thing to do就是当消极的想法is when a negative thought comes up,或者负面的情绪出现时or a negative feeling comes up将我们的注意力转到别处去 比如说is to distract ourselves from it by,for example,听听音乐 跑个步going to listen to a piece of music,going for a run,和别人聊聊这件事或者别的事talking to someone either about that or something else.这和逃避是很不一样的Now this is very different from avoiding.因为这并不是说 "好吧Because it is not about saying,"all right,我一辈子不要再管这种事了"I am not going to deal with any of the issues in my life."这只是说如果某种情绪或想法反复出现It's just saying that if there is a recurrent thought or feeling,我永远都在徒劳地抗争and I'm experiencing a Sisyphean battle against it- you know,把石头推上去 然后又被推下来pushing the stone up and being pushed down again,上上下下up and down again.有时更好 更有用的方法是Sometimes it is better,more helpful to just say,"好吧 我不要再反复想了 这没有意义"OK,I'm not going to ruminate; it's pointless.这个神经通路在我脑海中太强烈了This neural pathway in my mind is being so reinforced.不会有任何出路的" 然后说 "让我继续前进吧It's not going anywhere." And then to say,"let me move on.让我去听首好歌Let me listen to a nice piece of music.让我去跑个步 好让我能够真正忘记它"Let me go for a run that will really help get my mind off this."很经常地And very often跑步还能使我从全新的角度what a run can do is also help me look at it in a different,来看待这件事through a different lens.我们会更深入地探讨这个分心And we'll talk about it,much more about this distraction,因为差异非常微小 并不是逃避because it's nuanced,meaning we are not about avoiding.我们下节课So we'll talk about it next,周四讲到处理沮丧on Thursday when we talk about dealing with depression或者焦虑时 会用到冥想or dealing with anxiety,using meditation,用念来分心using mindfulness as a kind of distraction.但那也是一种积极对待的方式But that's also one way of looking at the positive.最后 第三个P是指换个角度And finally,the third p is about taking Perspective.这真的很重要吗Is this really gonna matter?Richard Carlson写了一本很好的自助书This is Richard Carlson's wonderful self-help book,"别为小事伤神 一切皆是小事""Don't Sweat the Small Stuff... and it's all Small Stuff".我不完全同意后半句Now I don't necessarily agree with the second-"一切皆是小事" 但很显然"it's all small stuff",but certainly许多生活中我们为之伤神的事都是小事a lot of things that we sweat about in our lives are small stuff.要不为小事伤神Now the issue with not sweating the small stuff就要问一个简单的问题 它在一年后会不会有影响is asking a simple question: is this going to matter in a year?或者更久...Or in a grand...从长远来看 它真的很重要吗You know,in a large schema of things,does it really matter?它真的值得我去担心 焦虑Is it worth my worrying,and fretting,为之沮丧 为之焦躁吗and being depressed and upset and anxious about this now?它在一年之后真的会有影响吗Is this really going to matter in a year?通常情况下都不会And most of the times,it won't matter.从另一方面说 有什么是真的重要的吗The other side of this is that well,then does anything matter?几年前 有个朋友问了我一个非常简单的问题A few years ago,I was asked a very simple question by a friend.他说And he said,"you know,just..."我们之前从来没聊过这个的 他是我很好的朋友You know we haven't talked about before- this was a close friend.但也没聊过 "你能告诉我心理成熟是什么吗But..."Can you tell me what psychological maturity is?通过你的研究From your research,你能想明白心理成熟到底是什么吗"can you think about what psychological maturity is?"就在这一霎那And off-the-cuff,就在当时 后来我又对这个定义做了些修饰at that moment- over time I revise the definition a little bit-我当时这么说 心理成熟I said the following: Psychological maturity00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:15,670就是根据自己的意愿转换角度的能力is about the ability to willingly shift perspective.我觉得这差不多是对的And I think it's more or less right.Again,基于这些关于转换角度的能力的研究looking at the research about this ability to shift perspective.为什么  这种转换角度的能力是什么Why? Or what is this ability to shift perspective?这就是我们希望沉浸在当下的It's the ability when we want to be immersed in the here and now,一种能力in the present.也正是我们退一步And it's the ability to,when we want,take a step back,时间和空间上都退一步 问这样的问题zoom out both in time and in space,and ask the question,"它真的有影响吗 一年之后呢"is this really going to matter? Or in a year?或者更长远来看呢 它真的很重要吗"Or in a grand schema of things,space? Is this really important?"同时随心所欲地回来And at the same time,go back almost at will.能够灵活地将思绪拉回来Have this flexibility to go back沉浸于聆听一首美妙的歌and be immersed when listening to a beautiful piece of music,或者和我们所爱的人一起or spending time with people we love.说起来容易 做起来难And again,it's easier said than done.但逐渐我们可以通过冥想来训练我们的思想But over time,we can train our mind through meditation,通过对事物进行认知重建through cognitively reframing things.我们可以训练我们的思想We can train our mind使其能够按照我们的意愿来转换to be able to make that shift almost at will.我来给你们举个应用三个P的例子吧So let me give you an example of the three Ps applied.这是刚开学时发生在我身上的事So this happened to me at the beginning of the semester,大约开学后两个星期about two weeks into the semester.我要带我的女儿Shirell去托儿所I was...I had to take Shirell,my daughter to day care.我就要迟到了 迟了很多And I was running late.I was running really late.你们知道我上课前一般都会去健身And you know what I like to do before lectures is to work out.我意识到我没时间去健身了Now I realized I was not going to have time to work out,我甚至几乎没时间复习备课笔记I hardly had any time to go over the lecture notes that我在上课前都会复习两遍I do twice in the morning before the lecture.于是我很沮丧 很有压力And I got upset.And I became stressed.然后我说 "就用用三个P吧"Then I said,"OK.Let's take the three Ps and apply them."第一个P 许可 接受First P,permission.Acceptance.我对自己说 "你压力很大 你很沮丧I said to myself,"OK.So you are stressed.So you are upset.这些都没关系It's OK to be upset.It's OK to be stressed.即使你是教积极心理学的 也没关系"Even if you do teach positive psychology.It's all right."我说的第二件事就是尊重现实The second thing that I said- respect for reality.这是学期刚开始的时候This is the beginning of the semester.很多事情都碰在一起A lot of things are happening.我们几个星期前刚从以色列回来We had just arrived from Israel a couple of weeks earlier.要倒时差 还有小孩要照顾A little bit of jet lag.The kids.尊重现实 现实就是这样Respect for reality.It is what it is.然后我转向第二个P 积极性And then I moved on to positive.有什么好处呢 第一个好处就是So what's the benefit here? So the first benefit is- well,我要更仔细地想想我能简化的地方I need to think more about where I can simplify,我可以说不的地方what I can say no to.做少一点而非做多一点 这是很显然的一个好处Do less rather than more.So that's certainly a benefit there.因为它让我去思考Because it got me thinking about it.第二个好处就是当时我想The second benefit that I thought about at that moment-"我现在又有一个可以在课堂上讲的故事了"oh now I have another story to tell in class.一个应用三个P的例子"An example of how I am applying the three Ps."分心 很简单Distraction- very easy.我旁边就有最好的分心工具I had the best distraction right next to me.Shirell 然后是转换角度Shirell.And then,perspective.一年之后这会有影响吗Is this really going to matter a year from now that我在上课前没有锻炼I didn't exercise before a class我没有复习两遍备课笔记and that I didn't go over lecture notes twice而是只复习了一遍but only once before class?所以我上课就不能发挥95%So I'm not gonna give a class which is 95 percent,只能发挥90%but just 90 percent.这真的很重要吗 不重要Is this really going to matter? No.但同时我对自己说But at the same time,I said to myself,"我仍然希望能享受当下""I still want to be able to enjoy the here and now."于是我和Shirell呆在一起So I took my time,spent time with Shirell,陪她久一点的时间stayed with her a few more,在托儿所陪她久一点 我们一起玩extra minutes in day care- we played together,然后我更放松 更平静地回家了and then went home,much more relaxed,much calmer,将三个P应用于实际发生的情况having applied the three Ps to an actual situation that arose.准许自己为人 接受它Permission to be human- acceptance.关注积极的一面Focusing on the positive- benefit finding.最后就是转换角度的能力And finally,the ability to shift perspective-我什么时候要退一步问自己when do I want to zoom out and ask this,"我现在需要为此伤神吗"do I need to sweat over it now?我什么时候想沉浸于当下"And when do I want to be immersed in the here and now?"想想这个技巧 非常简单Think about this technique.And again very simple.这个技巧并不等于可以一劳永逸Now this technique is not equivalent to an inoculation,你现在学到了这个技巧meaning it's not OK- now you learn the technique;我知道三个PI know about the three Ps.之后我的人生中 它都能帮助我Now for the rest of my life,it's going to help me.它并不是这样That's not how it works.它更像是一种药丸It works much more like a pill-你要经常定期服用that you need to take on a regular basis,也就是说每当你经历一次困境meaning if you are going through a difficult time,就应用三个Papply the three Ps.你应用的越多 生效就越快And the more you apply them,the faster it is.正如我所说的 三个PNow very often as I mention,the term three Ps.我几乎就是自动过一遍这个过程Already automatically I go through that process.许可 积极 转换角度 现在已经快了很多Permission.Positive.Perspective.It's much faster now.因为我应用它 不断地练习它Because I used it.Because I practiced it.所以你要不断地用它 多试几次So use it constantly.Try a few times.我们总结了很多Again,bring together a lot of the ideas课上讲过的内容that we have discussed in the course.OK.一年半前Year and a half ago,我有幸被Martin Seligman邀请I had the privilege of spending a full day到他家去玩了一整天with Martin Seligman inviting me to his home.我们坐在他漂亮的玫瑰园中And we were sitting down in his beautiful rose garden,就是他经常写的那个玫瑰园rose garden that he writes about often.坐在那儿聊积极心理学And sitting and talking about positive psychology-它的过去 它的现在 以及更重要的是 它的未来it's past; it's present; and more than anything,it's future.我们讲到了教育 讲到他在他的课上做了什么We talked about education,about what he was doing in his classes我在我的课上做了什么as well as what I was doing in my classes.然后对话进行到一半时And then,halfway through the conversation,他突然停住说he suddenly stopped and said,"Tal 你知道当今心理学的问题是什么吗"Tal,you know what the problem is with psychology today?不仅仅是积极心理学 而是当今的心理学"Not just with positive psychology; with psychology today."我说"是什么" 然后马上拿出我的笔记本And I said,"what?" Immediately taking out my notebook.他说"当今心理学的问题在于And he said,"you know,the problem with psychology today我们关注的大多是脖子以上is that our focus has mostly been neck up,而真正发生在我们身上的问题都在脖子以下"whereas most of what happens to us is neck down."我们关注的大多是脖子以上Our focus has been neck up;而真正发生在我们身上的问题都在脖子以下and most of what happens to us is neck down.听到这番话对我很重要Now hearing this was very important for me.尤其是从Martin SeligmanIt was double important hearing那里听到 就更为重要了from Martin Seligman for various reasons.首先 Martin Seligman总是走在前面的First of all,Martin Seligman has always been ahead of the game.他引领了认知心理学He has,you know,brought cognitive psychology into...在它还未盛行when it wasn't,it was hardly known,行为主义还是主流的时候when behaviorism was dominant.因此他的研究是超前于时代的So his research is ahead of his time.他开创了积极心理学He brought positive psychology,或者说将其整合为一门学科领域or integrated it as a unified field of study.Martin SeligmanAnd Martin Seligman-除了他是一个有远见并且also the second thing beyond him being a visionary很重要的心理学家之外and very important psychologist-他还是认知心理学的创始人之一he was also one of the founders of cognitive psychology.认知疗法是怎样的 就是关于脖子以上的I mean,what is the cognitive therapy about? It's about neck up.按照他的说法 我们过分关注脖子以上And for him to say,we have been focusing too much on neck-up我们需要关注脖子以下and we need to go neck down.这就意味着他已经想了很多That means he thought about it a lot.这意味着他确实研究了这种现象That means he really studied this phenomenon确实了解了我们需要一个大的转型and really understands that we need a serious shift here.而他十分正确And he is very right.这将是下两节课的话题And this is the topic of the next two lectures.实际上我要跟你们讲的是一种"灵药"In fact what I'm going to offer you is a "wonder drug".只提供给上1504课的学生And this is only for students in 1504.00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:12,140旁听的也算OK,the auditors as well.你们也可以得到"灵药"You can have that "wonder drug" too."灵药"将给你们带来这样的好处And here is what the "wonder drug" is going to be doing for you."灵药"能使你们感觉很好 非常好The "wonder drug" is going to make you feel good.Real good.你的自尊将显著提升Your self- esteem is going to increase significantly;你会更加自信you are going to be more confident about yourself,更加自信你在社会上的地位about who you are,about your place in the world,对自己更加自信in social settings,on your own-你会得到更高的自尊you are just going to have higher levels of self-esteem.And我们都知道自尊跟许许多多好东西相关联we know that self-esteem is associated with tons of good stuff,我们两周后会讲到which we'll talk about two weeks from now.你会觉得更平静 生活更有重心You are going to feel much calmer,much more centered.有了"灵药" 你甚至能变得更聪明You are even going to get smarter taking that drug.效果是显著的It's remarkable.你们开始有点担心了I mean you are starting to get a little bit worried here.它还会使你更吸引人It's also going to make you more attractive.你会觉得自己更吸引人You are going to feel more attractive你也会散发出更大的魅力and you are going to exude more attractiveness.这个"灵药"已经被测试了很多遍了Again this drug has been tested time and again.我说了And I'm talking...这都是研究成果 不是异想天开This is all research; this is not just whim.我是在向你们推销真的东西Here I am selling you something real,真正有效的东西something that actually works.And我还要说这药没有任何消极的副作用I should add that there are no negative side effects to this drug.相反 它还有无数积极的作用On the contrary,there are tons of positive side effects我数都数不过来that I didn't even mention here.不仅如此 它还是绝对合法的More than that,you can rest assure it's legal.我知道你们有点担心 但你们会接受的I know you were concerned here,but you can take it.你们能处理好You can take it.You can handle it.不需要担心You don't need to worry about it.如果有人来找你 很担心你怎么And if anyone comes to you,and is concerned about用了这个药 突然就变了个人how you suddenly changed as a result of this drug,你可以让他们来找我you can send them to me.最后 我不会收你们的钱And finally,I'm not going to charge you for it.我本该收钱的I should charge you for it.但我不是个好商人But I'm not a good business man,所以我接下来的两节课会免费发放给你们so I'm going to give it to you for free over the next two lessons这就是"灵药"And here is the drug.事实上它不仅仅是种药 是一杯鸡尾酒In fact,it's not just a drug.It's a cocktail.是一杯药做的鸡尾酒It's a cocktail of drugs,因为它们似乎要很多东西组合才能发挥最好的作用because they seem to work best in many situations.这就是那个鸡尾酒So here is the cocktail.我希望你们都在听I hope you are listening now.因为这很重要Because this is very important.灵药就是 半小时的锻炼 每周四次The wonder drug: 30 minutes of physical exercise,4 times a week.鸡尾酒的第二个成分The second component of the cocktail:610至少十五分钟的意念锻炼 每周六到七次at least 15 minutes of mindful exercise 6 or 7 times a week.鸡尾酒的第三个成分就是The third component of this cocktail with all these benefits:每24小时睡8个小时8 hours of sleep more or less per 24 hours.最后一个成分就是 每天12个拥抱And the final component of the cocktail: 12 hugs a day.最后一个可以过量The last one- you can overdose on.你想加多少就加多少Or rather you can- you can have as much as you like.但至少每天要有12个拥抱But at least 12 hugs a day.如果你服用这个药If you take,if you take this drug...你们可以拥抱 没关系You may hug.That's fine.这可是幸福课 但不要在课堂上睡觉This is 1504! C'mon! But no sleeping in class.如果你服用这个药 这个鸡尾酒 我保证If you take this drug,this cocktail,I guarantee,我保证以上提到的很多好处 就算不是全部I guarantee many of the benefits,if not all of the benefits and说不定还会比那更多 都会实现possibly many more benefits that I've just talked about before.你们可以看到只有今天You see today,only today,我们才开始认识到精神和we are beginning to understand the connection肉体之间的联系between mind and body.有一个人 第一个真正认识到的人One of the people,the first people to really understand我们接下来的两节课会讲到的 就是Jon Kabat-Zinnwho we'll talk about in next two classes is Jon Kabat-Zinn.以及他的著作 《全灾难人生》In his wonderful book,"Full Catastrophe Living"-摘自《希腊人佐巴》的一个短语a phrase taken from Zorba the Greek,Jon Kabat-Zinn说"也许行为治疗Jon Kabat-Zinn: "Perhaps the most fundamental development最基础的进展就是认识到in behavioral medicine is the recognition我们不能再认为健康that we can no longer think about health仅仅是身体或者精神的一个独立属性as being solely a characteristic of the body or the mind因为精神和肉体是内在联系的"because body and mind are interconnected."这可是否定了This is essentially a rejection千百年来西方的观念of hundreds of years of Western thinking.笛卡尔的二元论Cartesian dualism,René Descartes-"意识和物质是两种绝对不同的实体""the mind and the body are two irreconcilable separate entities."这也渗透到了医学之中And this permeated medicine.我们"修"一个人就像修机器一样 修他的身体How do we "fix" a person like we fix a machine,we fix the body.他的精神则是完全没有关系的The mind is something entirely separate from it.笛卡尔也不是凭空创造出的理论And again,Descartes didn't invent it.我们可以在柏拉图的作品中看到笛卡尔二元论的种子We can see seeds of Cartesian dualism in the works of plato,之后亚里士多德试图反对which then Aristotle tried to negate,重新建立精神和肉体之间的联系recreating the mind/body connection,但最终还是二元论成为主流but again was made clear very evident由十七世纪笛卡尔倡导in the West with Descartes in the 17th century.然后就有了Jon Kabat-Zinn 有了Herbert BensonThen comes along Jon Kabat-Zinn; comes along Herbert Benson;有了Ellen Langer 有了Tara Bennett Golemancomes along Ellen Langer; comes along Tara Bennett Goleman.这些心理学家 医生了解这种联系Psychologists,doctors who understand the connections-还有John Sarno 纽约大学的一个医学教授comes along John Sarno,a medical doctor from NYU,纽约大学医学院的New York University medical school他们告诉我们通过我们的想法and shows how with our thinking,我们可以解决大多数背痛的问题we can overcome most of our back problems或者腕管综合症or Carpal Tunnel Syndrome,显示出精神和肉体之间的联系showing the connection between mind and body,或者是安慰剂的作用 非常惊人or a placebo effect- staggering effects.还记得我们说它能起到和催吐剂相反的作用Remember we talked about it- reversing the effect of Ipecac以及我们如何用精神和肉体and asking how can we use that mind and body互相形成一个良性循环to help each other to launch a virtuous cycle between the two,精神帮助肉体 肉体帮助精神while the mind helps body and body helps mind?我想从身体锻炼开始讲起I want to begin by talking about physical exercise-鸡尾酒的第一个成分the first component of that cocktail,灵药的第一个成分the first component of the wonder drug.当今社会怎么了What's happening today?666当今社会普遍缺乏运动Today there is reduction of physical work.现在越来越多人More and more people today享有无需进行辛苦体力劳动的"特权"have the "luxury" of not having to physically work hard.我用了引号 因为这是特权中的And I put it in quotes,because it's one of the manifestations非特权的表现of the under-privilege of the privilege.在过去 我们要去追一只鹿才能有饭吃You see,in the past,we have to run after a deer for lunch,或者逃脱一只狮子 这样才不会被吃掉or run away from a lion so that we don't become lunch.我们要采摘果子作甜点We had to gather berries for desert.我们现在呢 去家里的甜点桌子就行了What do we do today? Go to the desert table in our house.或者叫份比萨Or call out for pizza.00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:31,990在过去 我们要想取暖就得收集木材In the past,we had to gather logs if we wanted to keep warm.而现在呢 就这样Today what do we do? This exercise.打开暖气 然后为此付出代价Turn up the thermometer.And we pay a price.我长大之后But you know when I grew up,当我在以色列长大时 我记得...when I was growing up in Israel,I remember...以色列是个内陆国家You know Israel is a Mediterranean country,下午两点到四点是午休时间 非常安静2 - 4 pm is siesta time.Very quiet.孩子们都不到街上去Kids are not out on the street.但四点整 有时甚至是3:59时But at 4:00,sometimes even at 3:59,每天都会从街上传来一声叫声every day there was a shout from the street,叫着"Tal 踢足球"calling "Taaaaal! Soccer!"然后叫其他的小孩 "踢足球"或者"捉迷藏"Then calling other kids,"soccer!" Or "Hide and seek!"或者"抓人游戏"Or "running around!"这是我们在午休时间之后从下午四点That's what we did from 4 pm after siesta time一直到晚上九点睡觉 还有妈妈喊吃晚饭时做的事until 9 when we went to sleep and mom called us to have dinner.而今天在以色列呢What happens today in Israel?不仅仅是以色列 全世界 下午四点是怎样的And not just in Israel,around the world,at 4 pm?不是下楼踢足球或跑来跑去It's not going down and playing soccer,and running around.而是继续坐在电脑前It's continuing to be on the computer.继续看电视It's continuing to watch television.结果就导致了And as a result of that,as a result of the fact,我们更习惯于坐着we have become so much more sedentary.我们付出了非常高昂的代价We are paying a very high price.当然是从身体上来说Of course on the physical level,但除此之外还有心理上的代价but even more than that,on the psychological level.这不是巧合It is no coincidence that抑郁的程度已经增加了十倍the levels of depression have gone up 10 fold.这不是巧合 从20世纪60年代算起It is no coincidence since the 1960s-这不是巧合it is no coincidence that当今抑郁症的平均发生年龄刚好只有15岁the average age the onset of depression today is just under 15.而在20世纪60年代 抑郁症的平均发生年龄是30岁Or as in 1960s,the average onset of depression was around 30.这是因为我们停止了锻炼It is because we have stopped exercising.我们停止发挥力量We have stopped exerting effort and energy.这不是巧合It is no coincidence that注意力缺陷多动症的病例指数上升the levels of ADD and ADHD are skyrocketing-更不用说 我之后也会说到not to mention,and I'll mention later,宅的生活方式的后果the physical consequences of sedentary life.锻炼不是种奢侈 这是种需要You see exercise is not a luxury; it's a need.就像氧气那样的需要And it's a need just like oxygen;就像维生素那样的需要it's a need just like certain vitamins就像蛋白质和碳水化合物那样的需要or a need just like protein and carbohydrates- our needs.我们不是We weren't made,不是生来就要坐在电脑面前一整天的we weren't born to sit in front of a computer all day long,也不是一整天聊天的or just to talk all day long.我们是要在一天结束时Yeah we are meant to do it at the end of the day打完猎采完果子之后干这些事的after we have hunted and gathered.不管是上帝决定 还是进化决定 还是两者共同决定的And whether it's by God,or whether it's by evolution,or both,我们都有对锻炼的需求we now have a need for physical exercise.如果我们不能满足某种需求 无论是对维生素的需求And when we frustrate a need,whether it's a need for vitamins,对蛋白质的需求 还是对锻炼的需求whether it's a need for protein or a need for exercise,我们都要付出代价we pay a price-既包括生理上的代价 也包括心理上的代价both physical price as well as psychological price.塞内加 两千年前的希腊哲学家说Seneca- over 2000 years ago,the Greek philosopher:"我们的祖先和我们过着一样的生活"Our forefathers lived every jot as well as we,他们靠自己的双手when they provided and dressed their own meat来获得食物 驻扎在大地上with their own hands; lodged upon the ground,还未受到黄金与宝石的诱惑"and were not as yet come to the vanity of gold and gems."这是塞内加 一个很有思想的哲学家说的This is Seneca,a very thoughtful philosopher,讲到他那个时代存在的talking about the lack of physical exercise缺乏锻炼的现象that existed in his time.现在这种现象严重了多少呢 今天在我们这个时代How much more is it today? When today we are living in our age,一两百年前连皇家都过不上的生活the way that not even royalty lived just 100 or 200 years ago,方便的 奢侈的生活the easy life,the luxurious life,这是特权中的非特权and it's the under-privilege of the privilege.我们要为此付出代价We are paying the price for it.让我们来看看心理学家是怎么说的Let's see what our psychologist has to say about this.Ellen DeGeneres针砭时事Ellen DeGeneres on the state of affairs."此时此刻"[VIDEO]Ellen DeGeneres "HERE AND NOW":我们很懒 做什么事都一个按钮搞定We're lazy.We have buttons doing everything.做什么事都不用体力了There is no physical activity attached to anything anymore.即使是开车库门Even the garage door opening-我们曾经要下车 打开车库门we used to get out of the car and open up the garage door.现在就只用按一个按钮Now there is a button you push,you know.还有车窗And the car window.这太过分了This became too much!我不想按按钮 我只想呼吸新鲜空气I don't want to turn buttons I just wanna fresh air!我们现在还在用这个手势We still use that gesture如果想让某人把车窗摇下来的话if we want someone to roll their window down in traffic.我们还在用 虽然已经没人知道是什么意思We still use that.Even now nobody's got it.因为如果我们这样做就会像个傻子Because we'd look like idiots if we did this.我们很懒 我们以前有薄荷糖We're lazy.We used to have breath mints.现在有洗牙糖Now we have breath strips.它们帮我们把舌头上的东西都溶掉They just dissolve all on our tongue for us.真是懒啊 我们不能吸吮了吗How lazy..Can we not suck anymore?放上来吧 我累了 我今天好辛苦Aa..put it on...I'm tired! Aaa...I had a hard day!我和你们分享几个Dr.Tal Ben-Shahar:Let me share with you a few studies关于这种生活方式的影响的研究about the effect of this kind of life style.是由Michael BabyakThis was done by Michael Babyak以及他在杜克大学医学院的同事共同完成的and his colleagues at Duke Medical School.这是个很重要的研究This was a very important study that做了很多很多的实验launched other numerous studies that模仿这个 并显示出这有多现实replicated this and showed how this applies,锻炼有多重要 不仅对于抑郁how exercise is important just for depression,还有其他方面also for other areas.Michael Babyak做的实验是So what Michael Babyak did找了156个抑郁症患者was bringing in 156 patients with major depression.这些人有各种各样的症状These are people who have a number of symptoms,包括失眠 饮食不规律 无精打采among which are insomnia,eating disorders,listlessness-不愿动弹 情绪低落lack of desire to act,depressed mood,其中很多人都有自杀的想法或倾向many of them suicidal with attempts or thoughts about suicide诸如此类and on and on.这些人身体都非常不好These people who are in bad,very bad shape.他将他们带到实验室And he brought them into the lab随机分为三组and randomly divided them into 3 groups.第一组是锻炼组The first group was the exercise group;第二组服药second group was put on medication;第三组既服药又锻炼and the third group was put on medication and exercise.他们所服用的药是抗抑郁药 左洛复The kind of medication was the antidepressant,Zoloft,继百忧解之后最普遍的抗抑郁药the second most popular,common antidepressant after Prozac-非常有效very powerful; works.很多研究 以安慰剂为对照 证明左洛复是有效的A lot of studies,compared to placebos,showing that Zoloft works是一种选择性5-羟色胺再摄取抑制剂An SSRI.他们所做的运动The exercise that they were put on是半个小时中等难度的was 30 minutes of moderate difficulty-有氧运动so aerobic physical exercise-可能是慢跑或者竞走 也可能是游泳so it could be jogging or race-walking; it could be swimming.不会太难 中等难度的运动Not too hard,but moderate difficulty of exercise.一周三次 每次半小时Three times a week for 30 minutes.然后跟踪调查这三组人And then he followed these three groups:锻炼组 服药组exercise group,the medication group,锻炼加服药组 跟踪调查了四个月and the exercise & medication group- followed them for 4 months.这是得到的结果And here are the results.你们预期会是什么结果What do you want to see? –这156个病人 或者每组52个病人中How many of the 156 patients,or 52 per group,有多少治好了抑郁症how many of them get over their major depression?他发现这三组中的每一组And what he found was that in each one of the three groups,四个月后都有超过60%的人情况有所好转over 60 percent got better by the end of the 4 months.他们不再出现They were not experiencing抑郁症的症状the symptoms of major depression anymore,或者大部分症状or most of the symptoms at the very least.他们不能再按照美国精神病诊断标准They were no longer,could no longer be categorized by the DSM-IV被诊断为抑郁症as having major depression.在各组之间没有显著的区别There was no significant difference among the groups只有一个区别 那个只锻炼的组except for one difference: the group that exercised only-需要更长一点的时间it took them a little bit longer来治好抑郁症to get over their major depression.在服药的情况下 一般要花上So with the medication,it usually took probably around,约一到两个星期 差不多十天来治好between 1 or 2 weeks,around 10 days to overcome their depression60%受试者的抑郁症for the 60 percent who were helped.对于仅仅锻炼的组 他们花了差不多一个月For the exercise only group,it took closer to a month.但在第一个月后 一旦他们好一些之后But after the first month,once they got better,就没有什么区别了there was no difference.三个组都出现了好转All three groups benefited as much.注意很重要的一点Now very important point:这并不代表我们就要废除抗抑郁药this does not mean that we should do away with antidepressants或者抗焦躁的药物 或者治疗多动症的利他林or anti-anxiety pills or Ritalin for ADD/ADHD.完全不是Not at all.他要说的是What it is saying though that我们首先要问的是锻炼we need to perhaps first ask whether exercise is,或者缺乏锻炼是不是其潜在原因or lack there of is the underlying reason for the experience.我们为什么不废除药物呢Now why should not we do away如果锻炼和服药的效果如此类似的话if the results are very similar between exercise and medication?我们为什么不废除服药呢 原因在于Why shouldn't we do away with medication? Here is why.比如说 让我画一个圆You see,let's say...Let me just draw this circle.假设No.Let's say这是所有抑郁的人的集合this is the total population of people who are depressed.我们知道左洛复We know that Zoloft,或者说抗抑郁症帮了他们60%的人or antidepressant medication helps about 60 percent of them.我们知道锻炼同样帮了60%的人And we know that exercise also helps 60 percent.但不是同一个60%However,it is not the same 60 percent.在定义上有重叠There is overlap by definition,因为多于50%because it is more than 50 percent.它们帮助的不是同一群人But it doesn't help the same people.有的人仅仅受了服药的好处So there are people who are only helped by medication;有的人仅仅受了锻炼的好处there are people who are only helped by exercise;还有的人两者好处皆有and there are people who are helped by both.00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:07,130所以不能说 废除服药吧So it's not saying let's do away with medication.它很重要 它确实有用It is important.It helps.但结果同时显示 "试试锻炼吧However it also says "let's try exercise,因为我有可能是得益于锻炼而不是服药because I may be helped by exercise and not medication,或者得益于两者or I may be helped by both.研究的关键在于Here is the clincher though in the study:我们在看这些研究时 想搞清楚的是so what we are looking for,as I look in all these studies,复发率 实验结束半年后is the relapse rates,meaning 6 months after the end of the study我们不再让他们服药when we no longer give medication,不再强迫被试者锻炼when we no longer push the participants to exercise每周至少三次 半年后如何了呢three times a week at least,what happens after 6 months?这是他们发现的结果And here is what they found:仅仅服药组的复发率只有the relapse rate of the group on medication only-60%多好转的人中有38%人回头38 percent out of the 60+ percent who got better returned back又有了抑郁症的症状 38% 超过了1/and had the major depression again,38 percent,over a third;这个既服药又锻炼的组the group that did medication复发率为31%and exercise- relapse rate of 31 percent,刚好比三分之一少一点 在这些60%好转的人中just under a third of the 60+ percent who got better;仅仅锻炼的组的复发率relapse rates of the exercise group only-他们可以选择继续锻炼也可以不锻炼and remember they could continue exercise or not;完全看他们自己that was entirely up to them-仅仅锻炼的组的复发率 为9%the relapse rate of the exercise only group,9 percent.十分令人惊讶的结果Remarkable results.和2000年之前的实验结果非常相似Similar results earlier than the year 2000,追溯到1984年的精神抑郁症all the way back in 1984 for dysthymia.精神抑郁症通常持续时间较长Dysthymia is usually longer lasting,但没一般抑郁症那么急性but less acute form of depression.是一种深层的悲伤的情绪So it's a deep feeling of sadness.比抑郁症持续时间长很多Lasts for much longer than major depression.但锻炼对它也有帮助But also exercise helps this.在我第一次看到这个研究时Now when I first saw this study again there are dozens,现在已经有无数这样的研究了there are hundreds of studies by now,在不同的领域重复这样的现象replicating this phenomenon on different,我等下会讲到different areas- as I'll talk about in a minute,我说 "哇 太不可思议了"I said,"wow! This is amazing!"不锻炼就像服用抗忧郁药 效果很像So exercise is like taking antidepressant- seems like it.锻炼就像服用抗忧郁药物Exercise is like taking antidepressant.但我再仔细想想But when I thought about further,就发现并不是这样I realized that wasn't the case.不是锻炼就像服用抗忧郁药It's not that exercising is like taking an antidepressant,而是不锻炼就像服用抗忧郁药it's rather that not exercising is like taking a depressant.这不仅仅是语言上的区别This is more than just a semantic difference.这不仅仅是语言上的区别This is more than just a semantic difference.为什么 因为我们不是生来为了坐着的Why? Because you see,we weren't made to be sedentary.我们不适合长时间坐在电脑前We weren't made to sit in front of the computer或者教室里or in the classroom.我们本来应该去逐鹿 或者逃离狮子的追捕We were made to run after that deer or run away from that lion.而当我们无法满足这种需求时 正如之前讲的And we frustrate a need,as we've talked about earlier,我们无法满足需求 就要付出代价we frustrate a need,we pay a price.比方说上帝或者基因决定的幸福程度So let's say our God-given or genes-given level of happiness,基本的幸福程度有这么高our base level of happiness is here.我们固有的水平就这么高Our set point or set range is here.如果我们不锻炼When we don't exercise,我们就把这个基本水平降到这里what we are doing is that we are lowering that base level to here如果我们的正常水平在这里If our normal level is here,当我们不锻炼时what we are doing when we don't exercise,就会把它降到这里we are lowering it to here.然而我们是可以达到这样的幸福程度的And then whereas we could have lived our life up here即使有兴衰变迁 也可能是螺旋式上升的with all the vicissitudes,and hopefully upward spiral,而我们现在是经历了what we are doing is we are living our lives同样的起伏 只不过是在更低的水平上the same ups and downs- only a much lower level here.我们努力挣扎着到达上帝决定And we struggle just to get to our God-given或基因决定的幸福程度or genes-given level of happiness.我不是个临床心理学家 我不是心理治疗师You know I'm not a clinical psychologist.I'm not a therapist.但是However,如果我是的话 我治疗病人的一个前提if I were one,a prerequisite for me for treating people,就是体育锻炼for working with people would have been physical exercise,或者至少or at the very least,我对他们第一个要求就是要进行身体锻炼being my No.1 priority of helping them to physically exercise.因为他们通常都是Cause very often they would come没有体育锻炼的动力because they don't have the motivation perhaps to exercise.00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:21,360但那会是我的首要要求But that would be my No.1 priority,要么是治疗的前提条件either to make it a prerequisite for being treated要么就是首要的要求or to make it a top priority.为什么 因为我不想和自然作对Why? Because I don't want to fight nature.我不想和自然作对I don't want to fight nature所以我要治疗的那个人必须达到上帝或者so that the person I'm working with gets to their God-given基因决定的幸福程度or genes-given level of well being.我想和自然合作I want to work with nature.自然所要求的必须遵守Nature to be commanded must be obeyed.自然的命令之一One of the dictates of nature就是我们要活跃地运动is that we need to be physically active.我在晚餐时就讲了这个Now I was just talking about this over dinner-我和网球教练Dave Fish 以及他妻子I had dinner with Dave Fish,the tennis coach and his wife,Bonnie Mosland 一个临床心理学家共进晚餐Bonnie Mosland,who is a clinical therapist.然后她跟我说 "对"And she told me,"yeah."她已经治疗了很多年病人了You know she's been treating people for years."我就是这样的"That's what I do.我治疗的前提条件就是你必须进行身体锻炼"Prerequisite for treatment with me is physical exercise."确实有心理学家So there are apprently psychologists能够理解锻炼的重要性who understand the importance of exercise.为什么要和自然作对呢Why fight nature here?当你可以在这个水平开始的时候When you can start and the base level can be here?还有其他好处 都是基于这个研究的Some other benefits- again all based on research.你们在阅读中可能读过一些You've read some of it in your readings,锻炼还有很多其他好处but more benefits to exercise.首先是心理上的好处 自尊First psychological benefit: self-esteem.从很多层面上说 首先是身体上的自尊On a few levels- first of all,bodily self-esteem,我们自我感觉更良好we feel better about ourselves;也包括整体的自尊 我们感觉更良好and also general self-esteem,we feel better about ourselves.不管是整体还是特征性的自尊都得到提升State as well as trait self-esteem increases.换句话说 不但锻炼之后我们马上就能感觉到In other words,as we feel right after we exercise而且长时间内我们都能感觉到but also as we feel in the long term如果我们保持规律的锻炼计划if we have a regular exercise regime.所以整体和特征性的自尊都会得到提升So both state as well as trait self-esteem is increased.焦虑和压力Anxiety and stress-是最容易被锻炼所影响的事之一one of the things that is most susceptible to exercise.Tammy能够看出来You know Tammy can tell,我妻子能够看出来我48小时内有没有锻炼my wife can tell if I have exercise for more than 48 hours.我回到家时You know when I come home,她会说"你最近一次锻炼是什么时候"she would say,"when did you last exercise?"为什么 因为她有感觉Why? Because she feels.她能察觉到she has the sense of you know,是不是有点小小的变化 或者稍微有点压力a little bit rough around the edges,a little bit more tense.正如我在之前的课上讲过的Again,as I mentioned in previous classes,我有焦虑的倾向I have inclination for anxiety.锻炼就是我的药 我的灵药Exercise is my drug.It's my wonder drug.至少要保证每隔一天锻炼一次 每隔一天At the very least,every other day.At the very least.这对无数临床的病症都非常有效It's been used very successfully for numerous clinical disorders.包括精神分裂症Even schizophrenia.它并不是自己起作用In conjunction with,not itself,而是和治疗以及药物协同起作用in conjunction with therapy and various drugs.但它增加了成功的可能性But it enhances the likelihood of a success如果你去锻炼的话if you exercise as well.还有注意力缺陷多动症 不一定足以治愈 但通常十分有效Also ADD and ADHD- not always enough,but very often enough.那些坚持常规锻炼的人People who exercise and exercise regularly-更容易克服注意力缺陷多动症much more likely to get over ADD and ADHD.为什么呢 因为这对我们的大脑有无数的影响Why? Because there are numerous effects on our brain,对大脑有无数的影响numerous effects on our brain.比方说我们释放的那个化学物质For example,the exact same chemicals that are released当我们形成新的神经通路时when we form new neural pathways-还记得神经形成或者神经可塑性吗remember neurogenesis or neuroplasticity-正是这个形成新的the exact chemicals that神经通路时会释放的化学物质 就能在我们锻炼时产生we need to form new neural pathways are created when we exercise.换句话说 我们去跑个步之后In other words,after we go for a run.这时我们的大脑就最适合于This is the time when our brain is most susceptible形成新的神经通路to creating new neural pathways.所以如果你在早上去锻炼 那么一整天So if you exercise in the morning,during the day,你就能更好地吸收你阅读的东西you retain much better the material you have read或者你听到的东西or you have heard.锻炼之后你会更有创造力You are much more creative after exercise,如果你已经锻炼了一段时间的话I mean if you have exercise for a few days.同时它能帮助我们释放And also it helps us release these chemicals恰好够量的这种化学物质 不多也不少in the exact right amount- no more,no less than we need.为什么 因为这是自然 自然比我们更懂我们需要什么Why? Because this is nature.Knows best what we need.我们释放这刚好足量的化学物质And we release these exact right amount of chemicals就达到了我们的最好状态that we are at our best.这又是一种方式 我之前提到过的This is by the way why again as I mentioned earlier religiously我每堂课之前都去跑步 不是次次都能去跑I run before every lecture.Well,I don't always run.我喜欢在外面跑 但不是每次都可以I like running outside but it's not always possible.所以我有时会跳家里的蹦床So I jump on my trampoline at home.我有一个小的I have you know one of the small ones.我在上面跳 戴着脉冲计And I jump on them.And I have my pulse meter on me.不应该告诉你们这个吗 好吧Shouldn't have told you this? No.OK.我能感觉到如果我不这样做And I can feel when I haven't,在上课之前不做锻炼when I don't exercise before lecture.比如说我去旅行You know,for example,when I travel,刚好赶在上课前回来 没时间去锻炼I arrive right before lecture and don't have time to work out,我能感觉到我阅读时I can feel when I read,我的记忆保留率 集中程度my retention rates,my concentration levels,我之前说过 我有轻微的注意力缺陷多动症cause as I said earlier,I have mild case of ADHD.锻炼是我的药And again,exercise is my drug.身体上的好处Physical benefits.我现在跟你们讲的不是什么新内容Again I am not saying anything new to you here.但你要这样来想它But here is a way to think about it.我们都有一个基因决定的体重水平We all have a genes/God-given level of weight,适合我们的体重水平of the right weight for us.当我们锻炼时 我们在那儿Now when we exercise,we are there.00:59:57,420 --> 01:00:00,这样就是健康的 是我们应该达到的And that is healthy.That is where we should be.当我们不锻炼时 体重就会超过这个When we don't exercise we are going above this weight.就像降低幸福水平一样Just like we go below our base level of well being.换句话说 锻炼的作用In other words,what exercise does就是将我们带回我们本来应有的水平is simply bring us back to where we are supposed to be all along,这也就解释了为什么大多数节食which explains why most diets fail如果不和锻炼一起进行 就很容易失败的原因if not associate with physical exercise as well.因为我们的身体会拼命想要回到原来的水平Because our bodies will always fight to go back to the base level我们本该有的水平to where we are supposed to be.如果我们不锻炼 就会挣扎得更辛苦And if we don't exercise,we will struggle even harder.慢性疾病 不管是糖尿病Chronical disease,whether it's diabetes,还是心脏病 抑或是癌症whether it's heart disease,whether it's cancer.数量是非常惊人的Once again numbers are staggering,absolutely staggering.糖尿病 有些糖尿病原本只有45岁以上的人Diabetes,certain types of diabetes were only experienced才会获得by people 45 years and older.现在小学生都会得这种糖尿病Today kids in elementary school are getting this kind of diabetes其原因很大程度上就是and the association is mostly因为营养问题以及缺乏锻炼because of nutrition and lack of exercise.经常锻炼的人People who exercise更不容易得慢性疾病are much less prone to these chronical diseases.患糖尿病的可能性大大降低Reducing significantly the likelihood of diabetes;减少了50%以上患心脏病的风险reducing by 50 percent or more the likelihood of heart failure以及得癌症的可能性and the likelihood of certain kinds of cancer.可以降低50%的可能性By over 50 percent reducing their likelihood-它是灵药again,a wonder drug.经常锻炼的人免疫系统更强People who exercise regularly have a stronger immune system.我要给你们打好提前量Well I have to prep you for this.最后 如果你现在还没被说服And finally if you haven't been convinced until now,希望这个能说服你hopefully this will convince you.(更好的性行为) 不管男人还是女人(Better Sex) Both men and women.都能增强性欲 对性的渴望Strengthens libido- their sexual desire;能够增加高潮的可能性enhances the likelihood of orgasms.经常锻炼的人性生活会更美好People who exercise more regularly have more and better sex.很多研究都证实了这一点Again,a lot of research showing this.它适用于任何年龄And by the way,this applies to all ages.不是任何年龄 21岁以上To all ages.Well,not all ages.I hope.21 and on.但是关于锻炼要记住的很重要的一点是Now the important thing to remember about exercise-它不是万灵药it is not a panacea.它不是万能的It's not a fix-all.记住不是所有人都能从锻炼中获得好处Remember not everyone benefits from exercise.对于有的人来说 服药就是There are some people for whom medication很适合和很重要的方式is absolutely the right thing and it's important.然而在很多情况下 研究和调查都证实了However,in many situations,and it's eveident by,by literature,在大多数情况下 锻炼是有帮助的by research- in most situations,exercise can help.就算不是它本身的作用Even it's not on its own.即使是和别的东西协同作用的 它还是有帮助Even in conjunction with something else.It helps.为什么要和自然对抗呢And again why fight nature? Why fight it?自然所要求的必须遵守Nature to be commanded must be obeyed.还有很重要的一点在于恢复What's very important is recovery.我给你们读读Let me read you something thatDienstbier和Zillig在《积极心理学手册》中Dienstbier and Zillig write about in the Handbook对研究者们这样写道of Positive Psychology to researchers in the field: ""重复的过于密集的训练 以至于没法及时恢复Repeated workouts that are too intense to allow complete recovery可能会导致运动员感觉到'泄气'may cause endurance athletes to experience 'staleness,'典型的症状为a syndrome that is characterized更高的焦虑水平by increased psychological symptoms of anxiety更高的神经紧张度with increased sympathetic nervous system,更高的儿茶酚胺和皮质激素水平"catecholamine,and cortisol base levels."他们想说的是Now what they are saying here有时事情是过犹不及的is that there can be too much of a good thing.尤其是完美主义者要明白这一点And this is especially important for perfectionists to understand越多不一定代表越好It doesn't mean that more is always better说到锻炼的话when it comes to exercise.确实会过度锻炼 有些过度训练的症状There is too much- and some of the symptoms of overtraining会和训练不足的症状十分相似are very similar to the symptoms of undertraining.高水平的焦虑 高水平的泄气Higher levels of anxiety,higher levels of staleness,失去动力lack of motivation,最终也可能导致抑郁as well as ultimately could lead to depression.这是完美主义的一种症状This is a symptom of a perfectionism.我在做运动员时就经历过这样的事This is something that I experience when I was an athlete-过度训练 恢复不足 并为此付出了代价overtraining,not recovering enough,and paying the price.身体上自然是受了伤 而且心理上也受了伤Physically of course with injuries,but also psychologically.我推荐每周有一到四天的休息时间What I recommend is between 1 to 4 days of rest a week.理想情况下你想每周锻炼五到六次Ideally you want to exercise 5 or 6 times a week;我认为至少要保证每两天一次at minimum I would say every other day.这样每周就是三到四天So it could be 3 or 4 days a week.至少每两天一次At minimum every other day.理想状态下你们可能想更多一点Ideally you may want a little bit more than that.每次半小时 也可以增加到一小时Each time,about 30 minutes; could go all the way up to an hour.关键是要听从你身体的需要The key here is to listen to your body.如果你的身体很痛苦If your body is hurting超出了正常的不舒适范围 赶快停止beyond the slight discomfort of exercise which is natural,stop.如果肌肉开始酸痛 停下来If your muscle hurts,stop.宁可少也不要过度Or on the side of too little rather than too much.还有一种聆听你身体的方法Also one of the ways to listen to your body如果你没那么敏感的话if you are not as sensitive to it,就是戴个心率监控器is putting on a heart rate monitor,不是很贵 但非常非常有用which is something not very expensive,very useful,very helpful.这样我就知道我的锻炼So I know my exercise会保持在最高心率的70%左右would be around 70 percent of maximum heart rate.我最高心率的70%大概是70 percent of maximum heart rate for me is about 128.于是我就在120到135之间锻炼So exercise around between 120 and 135.偶尔我又会加强一点And then once in a while I also introduce interval training,达到90%while I go all the way up to 90 percent,我的差不多是which is about 165 heart rate for me.很容易发现你们的心跳But very easy to find out about you know what your heart rate is-通常在最大心率是220减去你的年龄usually maximum heart rate is around 220 minus your age.所以如果你20岁 最大心率就是So if you are 20 your maximum is to 200.我37岁 所以就是Mine,being 37,is 183.差不多吧Again,more or less.然后你就保持在70%的水平And then you want to be around 70 percent of it.65%到75%的水平65 percent to 75 percent of it来获得锻炼的最温和的效果for moderate effective benefit of exercise.记住数量确实会影响质量And to keep in mind that the quantity does affect quality.我们再次画个图表And once again we have the graph that我们经常看到的线性曲线图we see so often: the curve linear relationship.在图的这边So if on this side of the graph,是心理和生理的好处we had psychological plus physiological benefit,这里是运动量and here we have effort or amount of work,那么图画出来就是这样 太少了不好the graph looks like this,where too little effort is not good.我们要达到基本的幸福水平才行We are compromising on our base level of happiness.太多了也不好Too much effort is also not good.这时我们就会感到泄气和焦虑That's when we experience the staleness and the anxiety.And我们想要达到的是差不多到最适水平what we want to get to is more or less around our optimum level.而这个最适水平也在于我们能投入多少时间And also optimum level given how much time we have.在理想情况下Yeah,in an ideal world,我每周锻炼六次  每次一个小时I would work out six times a week for one hour each time.在理想情况下是这样 但我还想做很多别的事In an ideal world.But I want to do many other things.所以我每周至少锻炼四次 每次半小时So I exercise at least 4 times a week,30 minutes each time.这对我来说就足够了 要搞清楚什么对你是足够的It's good enough for me.Identify what's good enough for you.恢复也很重要Recovery is important.我们从心理学层面上讲过恢复We talked about recovery on the psychological level.恢复很重要Recovery is very important.我简要地和你们分享一下Derek Clayton的故事吧Let me share with you just a quick story about Derek Clayton.Derek Clayton是60年代早期的一个长跑运动员Derek Clayton was a runner in the early 60s,世界上最好的长跑运动员之一one of the best long distance runners in the world.最好的之一 并不是最好的One of the best- not the best.他是跑马拉松的He ran marathons.很多人说 他之所以不是最好的And the reason why he wasn't the best,many people said,well,是因为从身体上讲 他不太适合跑马拉松because physically he wasn't that fit or suitable for marathons.他身高六尺二 1米He was 6 ft 2 in,tall- 1 meter 88.并且他的最大心率His veil too max,his maximum heart...最大血液溶氧量不是很高maximum oxygen capacity was not that high,没有其他世界级选手那么高as high as the top runners in the world.1144但他的优势在于But what he had going for him was that他是最勤奋的一个he was the hardest worker on the circuit.他每周跑一百多英里He would run in excess of 100 miles a week.远远多于一百多英里 非常努力Way over 100 miles a week.Worked very hard.抱歉 我写下来了的Sorry.I wrote it down.对 每周一百多英里Yeah,over 100 miles each week.于是他成为了世界最好的长跑运动员之一And he became one of the best runners in the world,但从来没成为过真正的第一but never got to be at the very best.然后发生什么了呢 由于他的过度刻苦勤奋And then what happened? Because of his hard work,over-exertion,他受了很严重的伤he got injured quite seriously一整个月不能跑步and couldn't run for a whole month,他当时正在准备非常重要的一项马拉松赛事as he was training for one of the most important marathons in-这个马拉松在日本举行this marathon was in Japan.一整个月他都不能训练So for a whole month,couldn't train.走路都走不了Hardly walked.在比赛一周之前 他开始可以慢慢地跑About a week before,he started just very lightly jogging.他说他会去日本跑的And he said he'll run in Japan.他被邀请去参加了 他是世界最好的长跑运动员之一He was invited there.He was one of the best runners in the world.他说他会将其作为一次训练He said he'll use it as a training run,作为下一次马拉松比赛训练的一部分as part of his training regime for the next marathon.于是他去参加了这个马拉松So he comes to this marathon,一个月没有训练having not trained for over a month,结果提前八分钟打破他的个人记录breaks his best personal records by 8 minutes成为历史上第一个仅用了and becomes the first person in history to run a marathon1168两小时十分钟跑完马拉松的人in under 2 hours and 10 minutes.两小时9分36秒Running it in 2 hours 9 minutes and 36 seconds.1967年1967.他继续努力训练 两年之后再次训练过度Continues to train hard.2 years later,over-trains again.又再次受伤Gets injured again.又一次他没法跑步And once again,for over a month he can't run at all然后他去参加了比利时马拉松比赛and then enters the Belgium marathon.又打破了他的个人记录 也打破了世界记录Breaks his own personal best,breaks the world record:两小时8分33秒2 hours 8 minute and 33 seconds,世界纪录 保持了12年的世界纪录a world record,world best that holds for 12 years.这时教练和运动员就开始明白This is when trainers and athletes began to understand适可而止的重要性 适当休息的重要性the importance of tapering,the importance of taking time off,恢复的重要性the importance of recovery.有时过犹不及There can be too much of a good thing.很相似的故事 Joan BenoitVery similar story.Joan Benoit.最终赢得了1984年洛杉矶马拉松Ended up winning the 1984 Los Angeles Marathon在受伤了 被迫休息之后after having been injured and having,was forced to take time off还有丹麦足球队The Danish Soccer team.另一个例子 我想应该是1991年Another example.I think that's 1991.最终赢得了欧冠Ended up winning the European Championship之前都没在比赛中after being out of the competition,在最后一刻才加入being brought in the last minute因为当时南斯拉夫正搞分裂because Yugoslavia was just breaking apart at the time.于是他们作为了南斯拉夫的替补So they came in as a replacement for Yugoslavia,在预选赛淘汰了之后literally taking the Danish team把丹麦队又找过来after it was eliminated from prelims,把他们从沙滩上带来打冠军赛bringing them from the beach to play the tournament.1195因为他们恢复了 振作了 于是他们准备好了But they had recovered,they were refresh,they were ready to go.恢复在运动中很重要Recovery is important in sports.在心理层面同样很重要It's important on the psychological level.锻炼是很好的 是一种灵药OK.So exercise is good.It's the wonder drug.鸡尾酒的第一个成分The first part of the cocktail,我觉得算是最重要的成分I would argue,well,one of the most important ones.然而很多人 不仅仅在哈佛And yet,most people,not at Harvard necessary,世界上很多人都不锻炼but most people around the world don't exercise.为了将定期锻炼引入我们的生活What are some of the barriers that we need to overcome我们要跨越怎样的障碍in order to introduce exercise regularly into our lives?首先 这是痛苦的First,it is painful.锻炼不是件舒服的事It's not comfortable to exercise比如说到达70%最大心率的锻炼at say 70 percent of our maximum heart rate.并不会很痛 但显然没有坐在电视机前Doesn't hurt that much,but it's more comfortable to sit或者玩任天堂舒服in front of the television or play Nintendo.那我们该怎么办So what do we do?我们要做的第一件事就是把目标分割 各个攻破The first thing that we can do is divide and conquer.尤其是完美主义者会做的一件事就是One of the things that especially perfectionists do is that"我要开始锻炼了"OK,so I'm going to start exercising.为了保持健康 我每天要跑六英里And to be fit,I need to do 6 miles a day.所以我一开始就要每天跑六英里"And that's what I'm going to start running.6 miles a day."很快会怎样呢And of course what happens very quickly?第二天你起床就会全身酸痛The next day you get up and you are hurt.但你是个完美主义者But you are a perfectionist.你很坚强 一分耕耘一分收获You are tough.No pain,no gain.于是你又出去跑步And you go out for a run again.然后会怎样呢 你第二天更疼And what happens? You hurt even more the next day.但你咬牙忍着疼痛But you push through the pain.几个星期之后你就会受伤After a few weeks,you get injured.但即使你不受伤 在你脑海中But even if you don't get injured,the schema that is created关于锻炼的概念是这样的in your mind about exercise is the following."锻炼就等于痛苦"It is "exercise equals pain".我们的意识是拒绝痛苦的 它总是极力避免痛苦Now our mind does not like pain.And it tries to avoid pain.比如说你去度了个假 中断了你的锻炼计划So let's say you go on a holiday.You stop your exercise regime.中断了一个星期或者两个星期You stop your exercise regime for a week or two weeks.然后你回来了And you come back.想重新开始锻炼就变得更难It becomes exceedingly difficult to go back exercising.为什么 因为你的思想 你的潜意识会说Why? Because you mind,subconscious mind says,"我不想再经受这个了""I don't want to experience this again."这会阻止你锻炼 使你瘫痪And it prevents you.It paralyzes you.这通常就是拖延症发生的时候This is very often the procrastination that comes through.因为我们不想经历这种痛苦Because we don't want to experience that pain.一种更健康的方式是A much healthier approach is to say "OK."我先从走路开始So I'll start with walking for a mile.走十分钟 二十分钟的路For 10 minutes,20 minutes walk.坚持一到两个星期 然后逐渐增加Do it for a week or two weeks.And then build it up gradually.宁可少也不要过度And again,earn the side of doing too little rather than too much因为那样锻炼Because then exercise,如果我逐渐增加 就不是种痛苦if I build it up gradually,is not about pain.它逐渐会成瘾Overtime it even becomes sort of addictive从积极的角度来看in a positive sense of word,我们想去做它 我们渴望它that we want to do it,that we long for it.所以要慢慢来 同时要应用让你分心的事物So doing it gradually.Also use distracters.当我在蹦床上跳时When I jump on my trampoline-在外面跑是不会有问题的when I run outside,I have no problem-但在蹦床上跳时 我就要用一些分心的事物but when I jump on my trampoline,I have to add distracters.我觉得蹦床太无聊了It is so boring for me.有的人可能会去骑一小时自行车Again,some people can be on the bike for an hour.那样也没问题And they are fine.我更喜欢冥想 这很好For me it's meditation and that's great.但很多人需要让他分心的事物 不管是音乐But many people need distracters,whether it's music,还是电视 还是小孩子在周围跑来跑去whether it's TV,whether it's my kids running around,但总要找些分散你注意力的事but having something that keeps us going.社会支持Social support.长期锻炼成功的最好预测方法就是The No.1 predictor of exercise success for the long term我是否是和其他人一起做的is do I do it with other people;有没有给我社会支持do I have the social support to do it.再次强调这不是对每个人都有用的And once again,this is not right for everyone.对有些人来说更好的方式是There are certain people for whom the right thing他们自己去做is to do it by themselves.有可能的情况是This is the time,尤其是内向的人 更喜欢自己去做especially introverts will enjoy just being on their own.闭上眼睛 听着音乐 Just closing their eyes,listening to their music,或者听着心跳or listening to their heart rate,whatever it...心跳的声音You know heart beating.他们会想要独自一个人的时间 这是没问题的But they want time by themselves.And that's fine.但对大多数人来说 社会支持是有益的 还有个研究But for most people social support helps.Here is the study.由Wing和Jerry 两名心理学家完成的This is done by Wing and Jerry,two psychologists.他们所做的是让人参与一个为期四月的项目What they did was introduce individuals to a 4 month program包括行为改变 包括饮食改变that included behavioral change,that included diet change包括锻炼上的改变 为期四月and that included exercise change for 4 months.分为两种情况 一种是有社会的支持The two conditions were either with social support-和你的朋友或者家人一起做doing it with your friend and a family member,或者没有社会支持or without social support.那些没有社会支持 自己完成的人Those without social support,who did it by themselves,有76%的人完成了这个为期四月的项目76 percent completed the 4 month program有24%的人还保持到了六个月and 24 percent were still doing it 6 months later.76%保持了四个月So 76 percent did it during the 4 months;只有24% 不到四分之一的人 保持到了六个月24 percent only,less than a quarter,did it 6 months later.能够保持行为上的 锻炼上的 以及饮食上的改变Kept up with the behavioral,exercise as well as diet change.有他人支持的一组The group that had social support,95%完成了四个月的项目95 percent completed the 4 months.95%而不是76%95 as opposed to the 76 percent.同时67%的人维持了这个计划And 67 percent continued with the regime保持到了六个月以后once the study was over for 6 months later.也就是成功的可能性大大地增加了So it enhanced the likelihood of success a great deal.再给你们看一个社会支持的例子Let me show you one last example of social support.录像[VIDEO]这不是我想说的意思OK.So this is not exactly what I mean.但社会支持确实是有帮助的But social support helps.所以如果你还没开始 那就从今天开始吧So start if you haven't started,start today.周四见I'll see you on Thursday.[掌声][Applause]
