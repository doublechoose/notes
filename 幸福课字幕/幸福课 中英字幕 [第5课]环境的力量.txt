我想介绍一位来自"为美国而教"的代表I'd like to introduce a representative from "Teach for America"这个组织一直致力于做好事which is an organization that has done and is doing a lot of good,在世界上宣扬善 我想…promoting goodness in the world and I'd like to--这门课 过去两年一直向他们提供支持in 1504, we've been supporting them for the last 2 years我们希望继续下去and we'd like to continue to do that.有请So please.大家好 能听到吗？Hello. Can you hear me?非常感谢Thank you so much for this.我只占用90秒I will take 90 seconds.我叫Josh BieberMy name is Josh Bieber.好的 我感觉很好Alright. I feel positive.我是为美国而教的成员 现在为组织工作I was a Teacher for America Corp member and I now work for TFA.负责新址开展I do new site development.大四时So when I was a senior,我勉强认为这是个机会I had marginally considered this is an option.招聘到期日 固执的组织招募人员I had a napping for a very pushy phone call打来电话 听电话时我差点睡着from a very pushy TFA recruiter on the deadline day--我本不会应聘I would not apply.但我还是磨蹭了两小时完成短文But I hesitantly took two hours to fill that essays多亏那个打来电话的人and now owe her for or owe that phone call for这是我人生最美好 最快乐的两年the best two years of my life and truly the happiest.请再给我一分钟So if I have 60 seconds,希望大家对组织有两个了解there are just two things that I want people to know about TFA.我想你们知道组织的目的I think you know what we are.一是这个国家对学校里的One, is that this country does not serve all kids孩子们的教育是不平等的in our schools fairly.低收入孩子在离开小学前So low-income kids before they even leave elementary school已落后多年are years behind where they should be.其中不到一半能高中毕业And nearly not even a half of them graduate high school,这非常不公正which is like, a terrible injustice,完全的不公正a complete injustice.二 你们能带来改变Two, you can actually make a difference.我开始也怀疑组织I was as skeptical as they come about TFA和自己的能力and my ability and all the rest.但我知道这是真的But I know this to be true.如果你走进一个五年级教室If you walk into a class with 5th graders,学生们从第一天开始就落后很多who on day one are years behind where they should be恨学校 因此也恨你and hate school and are kind of like to hate you because of it.九个月后And nine months later,他们成绩优异they leave honor above great level,恳求更多作业begging for some more work希望与你共度周未and wanting to hang out with you on the weekend.让你觉得一切都有可能You kinda think that anything is possible.我在此足以说明And that's clearly I am here now."为美国而教"对我来说是一个So for me, Teach for America is an opportunity真正让我实现想法和希望的地方to actually align my actions with my thoughts and my hopes参与实现我们都想见到的改变and be part of the change we all talk about wanting to see.我愿意鼓励所有同学So I would encourage you all,不管你们计划明年做什么regardless of what you think you may do next year,请大家超越那些想法 考虑这个机会or you may go beyond that to like, really consider this.它是我可能做过的最好的事It was the best thing that I could've done.最后期限是明天The final deadline is tomorrow.很容易做 不需要推荐It's easy to do. You don't need rex.申请就行Just apply.给自己机会And give yourself the chance像我一样爱上这份工作to fall in love with it the way that I did.最后我想说And I will just end by saying,现在坐在教室里的同学们if you are in this room right now,可能获得同龄人中最好的教育you've probably had the best education anyone your age,世界上最好的教育anywhere could possibly have.我们的学生和学校需要你们Our students and our schools need you.请加入我们So please join us.感谢给我的时间Thank you very much for the time.64祝大家上堂精彩的课And have a good class.大家好 只说几句Hi everyone.

Great.看左上角If you look at the up left corner,两年前 Gabriel修读这门课Gabriel was a student here in this class two years ago,在我们来推广硕士课程时when we came and presented on the program现在他正在我校读硕and he is currently a student in the MAPP program.这门课和我们的硕士课程So there is a lot of synergy going back and forth有很多合作between this class and our master program.我们的学生年纪从22岁到62岁Our student age range from 22 to 62.来自美国各地They come from all across United States,佛蒙特 弗罗里达 加州from Vermont to Florida, to California.来自世界各地They come from around the world:我们的学生来自英国 挪威we have students from UK, from Norway,瑞士 印度Switzerland, India,马来西亚 日本 香港Malaysia, Japan, Hong Kong,南韩和新西兰South Korea and New Zealand.25%到30%的学生是年轻人About 25% to 30% of our students are younger students刚刚大学毕业who are just out of college希望在进行职业训练之前and are looking to immerse themselves in positive psychology先深入学习积极心理学before going on into their professional training.其余学生是专业人士The rest of our students are professionals来自各行各业who come from a wide variety of professions.在第一班里In our first class,学生中有来自苏格兰的we had the former chief social worker inspector全国前社工总监for the entire country of Scotland within the class.那很有趣That was very interesting.肾移植医生We had kidney transplant surgeon,摩根大通的前副主席former Vice President of JP Morgan;律师 非牟利发展计划的主任we had attorneys, Directors of Development for Non-Profits;学校的常务董事executive director of school,Carlbrook Academy今年选择了我们的课Carlbrook Academy is in our class this year;人力资源主管human resources directors,咨询师 执行教练consultants, executive coaches,甚至音乐家和喜剧演员even professional musician and professional comedian.班里的学生可谓五花八门So it is quite a cross cut of students in the class.我想用两分钟Just in a couple of minutes,简单介绍一下教学设计I want to give you a little bit more sense of what educational design再简介一下课程内容is and just a brief over view of the course work.本课程是一年制全日制学习So this MAPP program is a one calendar year, full-time study.九月开始 八月毕业Students begin in September and end in August.我们的教育设计是混合模式The educational design is hybrid model--每个月 学生so once a month, students are on class,有一次现场教学on site, for intensive on site classes.其余时间And then in the intervening periods,学生通过远程学习模式完成they are on distant learning modules that the students complete.203这是一个职业硕士学位This is a professional master degree.教学重点放在And it focuses on积极心理学理论the theory and the application of positive psychology206及在各行各业的应用in various professional domains.目前来说So at this point,积极心理学there is not a separate licensing or credentialing还没有独立的执照或证书in positive psychology itself.学生来自教育Students come from education,商业 法律 医疗等各个领域business, law, medicine, etc,都有自己的文凭bringing in their own credentials with them.让学生每月来校一次So this design of having students on campus进行现场教学的设计once a month for intensive classes允许学生继续全职工作allows students to continue working full time.我刚说过Now just as I said,课程是全日制的 你可能奇怪the program is full time and you may be wondering,"怎么可能一边工作一边全日上课""How can students work full time and study full time."请记住这是一个职业学位Keep in mind this is a professional degree高级管理人员教育模式and executive education model就是为那些that is intended to be designed for people全职工作的人员设计的who are themselves working full time同时上全制日课程and still taking classes full time.多数学生继续So most of our students continue their work他们从事的工作they've been doing,继续全职工作同时又能上课continuing working full time when they come to our class.这种模式的另一个优势Another advantage of this model是不需要学生居住在宾州附近is students aren't required to live in Philadelphia.学生从全国各地赶来Students can commute in from across United States.即让我们惊讶且欣喜的是And what has been a surprise and pleasure to us:远在欧洲和亚洲的学生students have decided to commute也决定赶来in from as far away as Europe and Asia.我不知道现在你们如何来上课I don't know today what you commute was like to come to class.但我们的一些学生But some of our students come每月从南韩和新西兰赶来as far away as South Korea and New Zealand every month参加积极心理学课程to be part of the positive psychology classes.可以想象So you can imagine that为课堂带去的兴奋和活力adds real excitement and energy to the class也给教授施加了压力 我们要确保and puts a little bit pressure on the professors to make sure that能传授值得绕半个地球赶来学习的知识we have something worth coming half way around the world for.学生的多样性This enhances the educational experience obviously提升了教学体验by increasing student diversity:居住在海外的学生we have students who are living abroad赶来上课and coming in for the classes.我们还聘请多位教授And also we are able to tap into the expertise of professors,不局限于宾州大学not just at the University of Pennsylvania,还有其他大学but also at other schools as well我们请来最杰出的研究员so that we can bring in the very top leading researchers和积极心理学的从业者and practitioners of positive psychology.简单概述2008年秋的现场教学A brief overview of the schedule of on-site classes on the fall 2008:春季有五个you can see that there are five different intensive现场教学周未on-site weekends in the spring其余时间是远程教学as well with distant learning and intervening times.简介一下课程So just very briefly, the courses--每位学生秋季上四门课each student takes four courses in the fall,春季上四门课 然后是总结性课程four courses in the spring and then the capstone course.秋季时In the fall,课程集中介绍积极心理学的基础理论the courses focus on the foundational theory of positive psychology:Martin Seligman教Martin Seligman teaches the Introduction积极心理学课程概述to Positive Psychology course;Angela Duckworth教研究手段与评估Angela Duckworth teaches a course on Research Methods and Evaluation让学生it is very important for our students真正把握积极心理学科学很重要to have a real good grasp of the science of positive psychology,理解结论背后的研究手段understanding other research methods behind the results;我教积极心理学原理I teach a course in the foundation of positive interventions;第四门课是"通向美好人生的方法"and then our fourth course is Approaches to the Good Life,请来多位杰出的研究人员where we have different leading researchers come in讨论他们的研究and talk about their research.春季 我们的课程In the spring, our courses focus,不再以理论为焦点not so much on the theory,而是转向积极心理学的应用but now move to the application of positive psychology因为这是应用积极心理学硕士学位since it's a master of applied positive psychology.不知道你们是否学习了"特长与美德"I don't know if you study yet "the character strengths and virtues",Chris Peterson的"价值和行为分类"the values and the action classification by Chris Peterson.如果还没有学习If you haven't done that yet,我肯定不久会学到I'm sure you shortly will.他也会教授有关自己研究的课程He himself comes in and teaches a course on the work he has done.我教积极干预应用I teach a course on applied positive interventions课程也包括一个服务教育部分and we have a service learning component as a part of that class.Karen Reivich和Judith Saltzberg LevickKaren Reivich and Judith Saltzberg Levick教积极心理学和个体teach a course on positive psychology and individual--即在与他人的人际关系上so this is how to use positive psychology relationally如何应用积极心理学with other people,不论是在工作中 还是与朋友家人在一起时whether it's in working environment or with friends or family.最后一门课And then finally,不知你们是否熟习"肯定式探询"I don't know if you are familiar with appreciative inquiry--如果不知道again, I expect, if you not,我想Tal会在本学期向大家介绍Tal will be introducing it to you during the course this semesterDavid Cooperrider是这个领域的先驱David Cooperrider is the leader of this field of inquiry,将积极心理学方法which basically takes positive psychology approaches带入组织 并致力寻求改变into organizations and seeks to foster change at the level,不只是个人not just individuals,而是整体水平的改变but at the level of the whole.最后要修的一门课是总结性课程The final course the students take then is the Capstone project,开课时间是夏季which happens over the summer.这是一个独立课程This is an independent project允许学生结合where students are able to integrate课堂所学what they've learned in their classes进一步and take a step forward in the directions应用于他们各自的职业that they want to go in their own professional application of this.我们让学生进行研究So we had students do research,量化研究和质化研究quantitative research or qualitative research;我们让学生we had students do literature reviews就感兴趣的领域写文献观后感in a particular area of interest;他们计划写的书的进展计划work proposals for book they want to write;或实验计划等等or workshop proposals and those kinds of things.以上只是课程简介So that's a brief overview of the courses.Debbie会占用几分钟时间Debbie is going to just take a couple of minutes给大家看一些照片to show you some pictures--过去几分钟展示了太多文字this has been a lot of texts in the last few minutes.Debbie会展示一些照片

No?这个也不用看了Or that?可以了Here we go.最后也是第五个前提很重要The final and the fifth premise is an important one;是一个哲学前提is a philosophical one但我想在课程开始时介绍but one I want to introduce at the beginning of the course你们好理解我讲课的起源so that you understand where I am coming from,这门课程的来源where this course is coming from--因为很多人说because many people say,好的 快乐是重要的"Ok, so happiness is important.我们寻找它 我们有宣言We seek it; we have declarations--国家宣言national declarations,关于快乐对我们多么重要的个人宣言individual declarations of how important it is for us.但那不代表它是重要的 问题在于这个"是"But that doesn't mean that it is important or the "is",它是重要的但不代表我们应该去做the fact that it is important doesn't mean we ought to do it.我认为它不仅重要My argument here is that not only is it important,而且也应该是重要it also ought to be important.首先要阐述这个"是"So first about the "is".快乐 不论我们喜欢与否Happiness, whether we like it or not,不论它是有意识地whether it's consciously ,还是潜意识地 不论它是明显的还是隐晦的subconsciously, whether it's explicit or implicit,对多数人来说for most people--不是全部但对多数人来说not all, but for most people,快乐是最高追求it is the highest end.我们有宪法保证我们追求快乐And again, we have Constitution save God in our pursuit of happiness.我们投入大量努力We spend a lot of effort,大量时间思考自己和他人的快乐a lot of time thinking about it for ourselves as well as for others.二千多年前的亚里斯多德Aristotle, over 2000 years ago,"快乐是人生的意义和目的"Happiness is the meaning and purpose of life,人类存在的最终目标"the whole aim and end of human existence."William JamesWilliam James1890年在"宗教经验之种种"中写道in 1890 or in "The Variety of Religious Experiences" writes, "如果要问If we were to ask the question:496人类生命最主要的担心是什么?"What is human life's chief concern?"我们应该得到的一个答案是one of the answers we should receive would be:"是快乐""It is happiness."如何获得 如何保持How to gain, how to keep,如何重获快乐how to recover happiness,是多数人时刻怀有的秘密动机is in fact for most men at all times the secret motive of all they do,是他们愿意忍受一切的目的and all they are willing to endure."你们可能听说过William JamesNow you may have heard of William James--这里有幢大楼以他命名his name is after the building here.他在二百多年前谈到快乐And he talked about this over 200 years ago;亚里斯多德在二千多年前也谈过Aristotle over 2000 years ago.而且不只是西方人And it's not just peculiar to the West.达赖喇嘛 "不论一个人是否相信宗教The Dalai Lama, "Whether one believes in a religion or not,不论一个人相信这种还是那种宗教whether one believes in this religion or that religion,我们生命的最终目标是快乐the very purpose of our life is happiness.我们生命的主要活动是寻找快乐"The very motion of our life is towards happiness."快乐是重要的So it is important for people.不论是有意识的Again, whether it's conscious,还是潜意识的 明显的还是隐晦的subconscious, explicit or implicit,问题是它确实重要the question though is in fact it is important,但快乐应该是重要的吗？should it be important?快乐的道德维度呢？What about the moral dimension of happiness?还有很多事情在发生There are so many other things happening,世上有很多重要的事情要做so many important things to do in the world.为什么把快乐作为最终目标Why should we have happiness as our highest end,作为主要担心as our chief concern,为什么由它来决定生命活动？as that which determines the motion of our life?换言之 幸福有什么好处？In other words, what's good about wellbeing?积极情绪有什么好处？What's good about positive emotions?大量研究都尝试回答这个问题And there is a lot of research to answer this question.暂不说研究But before the research,感觉好就是感觉好it feels good to feel good.想到快乐 注入内心Think about it. Internalize it.这是亚里斯多德的"同一律"This is Aristotle's Law of Identity:一即一 感觉好就是感觉好A is A-- it feels good to feel good.这本身就是辩解理由And that, in and of itself is justification:如果能感觉好 为什么不感觉好呢?why not feel good, if we can feel good?证明So the burden to prove快乐为什么是不重要的重担可能落在why happiness is not important may be on the people执否定观点的人身上who would argue otherwise--我们会在以后谈到这个论点we will talk about that argument later.但首先的关键问题是快乐本身是好的But the first key issue is that it's good in and of itself--几乎无需辩解almost needs no justification.然而除了感觉好However, beyond just feeling good,快乐还对我们的人生有帮助happiness also contributes to our life,对人际关系有帮助to our relationships.对他人有帮助It contributes to other people.Barbara Fredrickson做了这项研究This is research done by Barbara Fredrickson,在宾州大学任教的学会成员one of the faculty members who teaches at U PENN.你们曾在上面见过她的照片You saw a picture of her up there.Barbara Fredrickson的观点是What Barbara Fredrickson says is that积极情绪有一个进化理由positive emotions have an evolutionary reason,它们的目的不仅仅是让人感觉好that they have a purpose beyond just making us feel good.比如它们有助我们超越For example, they help us think beyond现在的思考范畴 拓展我们的思想what we are thinking right now, broaden our thinking;有助我们建立人际关系they help us build relationships;帮助我们建立能力they help us build capacities--这门课的一个主要概念remember one of the key concepts of this course就是积极情绪is the positive emotions,积极心理学positive psychology as a field as a whole,就是要建立能力is about building capacities.我们使用的两个类比The two analogies we use是加强我们的免役系统或加强"心理引擎"was strengthening our immune system or stronger "psychological engine"获得更强大的忍受能力that has the capacity to endure more不只是从负到零not just from the negative to zero,还要从零到正but also from the zero to the positive.这是Barbara Fredrickson的观点So this is Barbara Fredrickson.我想进一步引用她的文章Let me quote extensively from her article,也是你们这周要阅读的which I believe you are reading for this week,"我们应该努力培育积极情绪"We should work to cultivate positive emotions在自己身上和周围人身上in ourselves and in those around us,不能只将它们作为终极状态not just as end states in themselves,还要将其作为手段实现心理成长but also as a means to achieving psychological growth改善心理和身体的健康and improved psychological and physical health over time.我称其为积极情绪的扩建理论I call this the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions因为积极情绪似乎能扩展人们的瞬间想法because positive emotions appear to broaden people's momentary thought和动作指令库并建立持久的个人资源action repertoire and build the enduring personal resources.通过体验积极情绪Through experiences of positive emotions,人们实现改变people transform themselves,变得更有创造力 更博学becoming more creative, knowledgeable,适应性更强 更易融入社会resilient, socially integrated,获得更健康的人格"and healthy individuals."体验积极情绪有诸多好处Numerous benefits to just experiencing positive emotions.是双赢的It's a win-win.它让人感觉好It feels good.对我们有好处 对整个社会也有好处And it's good for us and it's good for society as a whole一会我就会解释as I'll argue momentarily.她谈到的问题包括So what she's talking about here, for example,积极情绪有助我们克服消极情绪is that positive emotions help us overcome negative emotions.体验消极情绪时What happens when we experience negative emotions我们的意识is that our consciousness,我们的思维变得狭窄 收紧our thinking narrows and constricts.只专注于一件事 比如We focus just on one thing, so for example.那可能是件好事And that can be a good thing--一头狮子朝我冲过来you know, a lion comes to and charges me,我不想考虑宾州大学硕士申请的事"I don't want to start thinking about my MAPP application.不想考虑室友说了什么I don't want to start thinking about what my roommates say.我只想考虑这头狮子I want to focus on the lion.我的意识变得狭窄 收紧So my consciousness narrows and constricts,进入"对抗或逃跑"模式and I'm in the "fight or flight" mode.有狮子朝我冲来时是件好事Now that's a good thing when a lion charges me.但它变得不是很好But it's not a very good thing如果我的意识继续狭窄if my consciousness continues to narrow收紧超出威胁 超出困难and constrict beyond the threat, or beyond the hardship.我们知道经常会进入下行螺旋And what we know is that very often we enter a downward spiral,一个恶性循环 当我们进入狭窄收紧的模式a vicious cycle when we go into this narrow and constrict mode.随便举个例子So for example, just for example-- a random example:女朋友离开了我My girlfriend leaves me, alright?我的思维收窄缩紧And I narrow and constrict in terms of my thinking--一心只想着被女友甩了all I am thinking about is just that.结果就是And what will happen is as a result,我感觉悲伤I experience sadness,因为我一心只想那个 悲伤because that is what I am thinking about, and sadness--是一种痛苦的情绪 一种消极情绪a painful emotion, not a positive emotion--导致进一步的收窄缩紧leads to further narrow and constrict.那有可能And that can potentially,并非总是 但可能一直持续下去not always, but potentially can go on and on and on.直到变成抑郁And that's when it can become depression.那时我将很难脱离这种下行That's when I have difficulty getting out of this downward,恶性的循环vicious cycle.积极情绪正相反Positive emotions do the opposite.它们扩展建立They broaden and build.扩建导致积极情绪Broaden and build leads to positive emotions.积极情绪再进一步扩建Then positive emotions further broaden and build.所以是个良性循环So that's a virtuous cycle.我眼界宽了And I look broadly,关注其他人I look to othe people,关注其他事 思考现在我能做什么?I look to other things: So what can I do now?我能去哪里?我把时间用在哪里?Where can I go? Where can I spend my time?很经常的是And very often what that does--积极情绪把我们带出下行螺旋a positive emotion can take us out of this downward spiral形成一个上行螺旋and create an upward spiral.积极情绪可以是看一部滑稽电影A positive emotion can come in form of watching a humorous film;可以是"一次深呼吸"it can come in form of "if you take a deep breath"--探讨"心理 身体"时会谈到深呼吸we talked about deep breathing when we talked about my body;积极情绪可以是与朋友交流a positive emotion can come in form of interaction with a friend,一次愉快的交流a pleasant one.积极情绪It's the positive emotion能把我们带离这个下行螺旋进入这个上行螺旋that can take us out from this downward spiral to this upward spiral.而且不用很久And again it doesn't always take a very long time.00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:06,710困难在于将之与准许为人相结合And the challenge is to combine "the permission to be human"去体会情绪 实现转移to experience the emotion to go through the motion但不会进入下行螺旋and yet not to enter the downward spiral where six months later,在发生小小意外六个月后 仍心情低落after small incident, I'm still in that rot.我们会谈到什么是合适的时候We'll talk about what is the right time如何找到合适的时候and how do you find the right time,以及如何在how do you find the balance思考痛苦情绪between thinking about painful emotions和让痛苦情绪滑入沉思到平衡and when does it slide to rumination,沉思并非总有帮助which is not always helpful.它有助克服消极情绪So it helps overcome the negative emotions.还有创造力 我们的眼界更宽Also, creativity-- we think broadly--能产生更多联系we are able to make connections,看到以前没有看到的联系see connections we haven't seen before, perhaps.有很多关于"抑郁创造者"的说法There's a lot of the talk about the depressive creature.如果你想拥有更高水平的创造力If you want to have high level of creativity,必须承受抑郁it's a must you have to be depressed.其实并非如此Well, it turns out that's not the case.躁狂抑郁病人一般更有创造力Very often manic depressives are highly creative,但一般在躁狂阶段but that's usually during their manic phases.在抑郁阶段 我们的思维收窄In the depressed phase, our thinking is narrow;我们失去创造力we don't think outside the box usually--当然有例外 但总体而言没有of course there's many exceptions, but as a whole.实际上有这样一项研究In fact there's research--在内科医生 医生中间进行for example, this was done with internists, doctors,向他们提出一个who are giving a very difficult,与肝脏问题有关的很困难的问题very difficult question connected to a liver problem那是一个病人的病症that an individual patient had.医生们被随机分成三组And they divided them randomly into three groups--第一组是对照组the first group was a control group--他们必须解决这个问题they just had to solve the problem;第二组听一段有关the second group was given a statement医学人文观的声明about humanistic value of medicine--为什么作医生如此重要why is it so important to be a medical doctor;第三组得到糖果and the third group was given candy让他们获得愉快放松的好心情and put in a funny playful good mood.第三组得到糖果The third group that was given the candies并获得积极愉快的心情and put in a positive playful mood明显比另外两组有更好表现outperformed the other two groups significantly--他们考虑更多选择they thought about more options得出更好的问题解决办法and they actually came up with better solutions with that problem.这是这个领域中的一项研究And this is one of many studies in this area.再举个例子 小孩子Another example-- children.一群小孩组成对照组One group of children was a control group;有人教第二组小孩回想the second group was taught to think back让他们大笑或微笑的经历to experience that make them laugh or smile.第二组And that group did much better在学习任务上比对照组表现更好on the learning task than the control group,因为他们被置于积极情绪because they were put into a positive mood.它是双赢的Again, it's a win-win.它在很多方面定义了"没有痛苦就没有回报"It's defined in many ways that "no pain, no gain" paradigm,不论是对医生的教育还是在学校whether it's education of doctors or in school,在一般的工作场所也一样as well as generally in the workplace.因为动力和精力Because you see, also motivation and energy--不需要研究就能明白you don't need research for that,你知道感觉好时you know that when you are feeling good,动力和精力更充沛you have more motivation, you have more energy--当然有很多研究支持这一点of course, there is a lot of research to back that up.最终达到成功And ultimately success.他们调查专业人士They look in the professional people能更好地控制自己的情绪who are able to manage their emotions获得积极情绪better and lead to positive emotions,脱离狭窄收紧进入扩建的人get out of this narrow and constrict to the broaden and build长远会取得更大成功are in the long term more successful.他们不是没有痛苦情绪Again, it's not that people who don't have painful emotions--没有的都是死人remember? They are all dead.那些人经历痛苦情绪It's that people who experience painful emotions但同时能够更好地but are all in the same time able to shift themselves,把自己 他们的意识 思想their consciousness, their thinking,他们的感受向积极方向转移their experience to the positive more readily.越快乐的人越成功And happier people are more successful,因为他们有更多精力 工作更努力because they have more energy and work harder.因为他们在追求It's because their pursuing something而不是在逃离rather than running away from something--这叫"靠近而非逃避目标"it is called "approach rather than avoidance goals"--我们将在探讨"目标"时谈到we'll talk about that during the week on goals.还因为他们建立更好的人际关系Also because they form better relationships.他们更开放更宽容They are more open and generous.他们的创造力更强And they are more creative.所有这些因素最终导致更高层次的成功All these components ultimately lead to higher levels of success.积极情绪不仅有助成功Positive emotions not only contribute to our success,不仅能让我们感觉好they don't just contribute to our feeling good,还有助我们获得幸福they also contribute to our wellbeing.乐观的人Optimistic people, and again,不是指盲目的乐天派not Pollyannaish detached optimism,而是脚踏实地的乐观主义者but grounded optimists,平均而言 明显更加长寿on average, live significantly longer.保佑你们Bless you.免疫系统更强The immune system is stronger,所以对身体健康也有帮助so it also helps in terms of physical health.现在的问题是 道德问题But now the question is the moral question:那么其他人呢?What about other people?我谈论经营自己的生活How can I talk about or act in my life,追求自己的快乐 这怎么不是自私?pursuing my happiness isn't that selfish?答案是"是的 那是自私"Ant the answer is: "Yes, it is selfish."当我对自己说When I talk to myself, when I say to myself,"我想更快乐""I want to be happier",我对自己说"我想更快乐"I say to myself, "I want to be happier."那是一件自私的事That' s a selfish thing.它是坏的吗?是不道德的吗?So it that bad? Is that immoral?在我们的文化中Well, in our culture,自私和不道德成了同义词selfishness and immorality have essentially become synonymous.那是个问题And that's a problem.这就是为什么 因为这是头号And here's why. Because this is the No. 1--将自私等同于不道德是头号原因equating to selfishness and immorality is the No. 1 cause--多数是在潜意识里subconsciously mostly, but not only--导致不快乐的头号原因No. 1 cause of unhappiness.人们为追求自己的快乐感到内疚Because people feel guilty about pursuing their own happiness.人们在自我感觉很好时会内疚People feel guilty at times feeling good about themselves.我怎么可以? 我怎么敢自我感觉良好?How can I? How dare I feel good about myself?我怎么能追求自己的快乐How can I pursue my happiness当世上有那么多痛苦时?when there is so much suffering in the world?世上确有很多痛苦And there is a lot of suffering in the world.我们要如何回应?So how do we respond to that?首先 快乐是正和博弈First of all, happiness is a positive sum game--不是零和博弈it's not a zero sum game.也不是负和博弈Neither it is a negative sum game--我的快乐不是从别人那里夺来it's not that my happiness takes away from other people's happiness那将是负和博弈which will be a negative sum game:我有更多 你一定更少if I have more, you'll necessarily have less.甚至不是一个零…It's not even a zero--或者我更少or rather if I have less,你也会更少 那也是负和博弈you'll have less- that's a negative sum game--或零和博弈 我更多 你就会更少or a zero sum game-- if I have more, you'll have less-饼就那么大it's a fixed pie.不是这样的It's not that.它是一个正和博弈It's a positive sum game.为什么?因为快乐是感染的Why? Because happiness is contagious.如果我更快乐 我更有可能If I'm happier, I'm more likely对他人的快乐和幸福作出贡献to contribute to other people's happiness and wellbeing.感受快乐 换言之Being happy, in other words,也是一种道德状态is also a moral state in the sense of actually contributing对他人的幸福作出贡献to other people's wellbeing.佛在几千年前就谈到它The Buddha talked about it thousands of years ago,"一支蜡烛可以点燃千支蜡烛"Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle,蜡烛的生命不会被缩短and the life of the candle will not be shortened.分享绝不会减少快乐"Happiness never decreases by being shared."就像传递光明It's like passing on light.你快乐并努力争取快乐If you are happy, and work on your happiness,就是间直接对他人的快乐作出贡献you are contributing indirectly to other people's happiness,就像上次大笑的婴儿 把你们逗笑just like the baby who laughed last time-- made you laugh.笑是感染的It's contagious.一般来说 努力争取快乐的人Generally people who work on their happiness--再一次 不是那些总是保持快乐的人again, not people who experience constantly high,那种人将很难建立人际关系they would have difficulty having real relationships因为他们是死的since they are dead--一般来说 活着的人but generally, people, those of us who are alive,努力争取快乐who work on happiness,体验生活的变迁 起起落落who experience the vicissitude of life-- the ups and downs--但努力争取快乐而且越来越快乐but overall work on happiness and become happier and happier,有更好的人际关系have better relationships,更宽容 更接受他人more generous, more accepting of other people,更容忍他人和他们自己more tolerant of other people as well as themselves.很多研究表明自我帮助There's a lot of research to show that helping ourselves,换言之 努力为自己争取快乐in other words, working on our happiness,有助我们获得幸福contributing to our wellbeing,也能引导我们对他人更加宽容和亲切leads us to also be more generous and benevolent toward others.一位重要的研究者This is a research by one of the leading researchers,积极情绪领域的首批研究者之一one of the first researches in the area of positive emotions,Alice Isen进行了这个研究Alice Isen.她反复证明And she showed, time and again,感觉好如何对我们和他人都有益how feeling good is good for us and good for others,反之亦然and it works the other way as well.这是快乐很美妙的地方This is a wonderful thing about happiness.别人快乐你也快乐It works the other way as well,因为帮助他人也是帮助自己because helping others also helps ourselves.记得你们这周的任务Remember your task for this week--一些同学已经知道a dozen of you have already read it--就是去做超越以往所做的事情it's to commit- above and beyond what you usually commit-一天内多做五件好事five extra acts of kindness during one day.多做五件好事Five extra acts of kindness.这是Sonja Lyubomirsky做过的一项研究This is a research done by Sonja Lyubomirsky--我在第一堂课提及她的书I mentioned her book in the first class:《快乐之道》"The how of happiness".她很好地She's done fantastic work,证明人们showing how people who help--不论是在一周内多做五件好事whether it's helping five extra acts during the week--可以更多it can be more;不必局限于五件doesn't have to be restricted to five--或者人们在一天内多做五件好事or people who help five extra acts during one day,都能让他们更幸福it's actually contributing to their wellbeing.帮助他人也是帮助自己So helping others is also helping ourselves.我说到的一件事 只说了一半意思You know, one of the things that I say and only half ingest,即最自私的所为就是善举is that I know of no more selfish act and a benevolent act.只说了一半意思Again, only half ingest--因为两者有内在联系because the two are interconnected.两者间有自我实施的循环And there is a self-enforcing loop between the two,帮助他人就是帮助自己where helping others helps ourselves;帮助自己继而帮助他人and helping ourselves, in turn, helps others.不要把它看作自私And rather than looking it as selfish--有人可能会这样简单考虑some people may feel this ease way--不该把自私等同于不道德and rather than looking it as selfish i.e. -- equal immoral.我们应该把它视为We should look at it as something人性的美妙之处that is so wonderful about our nature,是我们应该颂扬的本性a part of our nature that we should celebrate.我们的快乐与他人的相关连The fact that our happiness is tied to others,我们通过同情网络和他人相关连the fact that we are tied to others in a web of empathy--那是人性的美妙之处that's a wonderful thing about human nature.一样值得我们进一步颂扬的东西A thing that we need to celebrate much more than we are doing already.如果不颂场Because remember, if we don't celebrate,如果我们不欣赏人性的那一部分if we don't appreciate that part of our nature,人性的那一部分将贬值that part of our nature will depreciate.欣赏有两个意思To appreciate has two meanings as we talked about:一是懂得感谢 二是传递one is to say "thank you" for something and two is to grow.如果我们欣赏人性中If we appreciate the good in our nature,欲望中好的东西in our inclinations,如果我们欣赏本性中那一部分if we appreciate that part of our nature,它将升值 我们将获得更多it will appreciate and we'll have more of it.如果我鄙视它并说If we look down at it and say,"很可怕"It's a terrible thing that我从帮助他人身上获得利益"I just derive benefits from helping other people",那么本性中那一部分将随时间贬值then that part of our nature will depreciate over time.你们正在读我书中的冥想部分For your readings, you are reading one of the meditations in my book,书中有更详细的阐述where I talk about it a little bit more in length,也给出了哲学基础and I also gave the philosophical foundation,因为在很多方面有别于"数数和思考"because in many ways this goes against "counting and thinking"那种方法在20和21世纪处于统治地位that has been so dominant in our 20th and 21st century思考道德thinking about morality.感谢好就是感觉好It feels good to feel good.也能让他人感觉好It also contributes to others to feel good.我想以介绍一位I want to end this premise idea一生致力于by talking a little bit about a person for whom,传播快乐的人来结论这个前提one of the chief purpose in life was to spread happiness--圣雄甘地 这是关于他的一个故事Mahatma Gandhi. This is a story about him.一个女人像很多人一样There was a woman like many people came来寻求甘地的建议to ask for advice from Gandhi.她长途赶来And she came from very far away.还带着儿子And she brought her son along.她拜见甘地And she said in front-- she got audience with Mahatma,在他面前说 她对他说and she said in front of him, and she said to him"我长途赶来 因为我儿子有个问题"I came from afar, because I have a problem with my son.我儿子吃太多糖My son eats way too much sugar.希望你能告诉他别吃太多糖And I'd like you to tell him to stop it.因为糖损害他的健康 牙齿Because it's hurting his health, his teeth.他会听你的 他很崇拜你"And he will listen to you. He admires you.甘地看着她说" Gandhi looked at her and said,"夫人 你能一个月后再来吗?""Madam, can you please come back in a month?"她不明白为什么但还是听了他的话She didn't know why but she listened to him after all--因为他是甘地he was Gandhi.她离开 长途返回She left, went far away,一个月后又回来came all the way back a month later,再次与甘地见面and once again, got an audience with Gandhi.她在他面前说She said in front of him,她说"一个月前我来过"She said "I was here a month ago."他说"是的 我记得"And he said, "Yes. I remember."她说"你能告诉我儿子And she said, "Could you please tell my son不要吃太多糖吗?"to stop eating so much sugar?"于是甘地注视着那个孩子说So Gandhi looks at the child intensely and says,"孩子 不要再吃太多糖""Son, stop eating too much sugar."就是这样And that's it.那个女人很困惑 她鼓起勇气The woman is obviously perplexed and musters up her courage,说"圣雄 非常感谢and says, "Mahatma, thank you very much.我肯定他不会再吃太多糖I'm sure he will stop eating too much sugar,但为什么不在一个月前告诉他but why couldn't you tell him this a month ago,在我长途赶来的时候?"when I came all the way here?"他说"夫人 因为一个月前And he said, "Well, madam, because a month ago,我也吃太多糖"I was eating too much sugar."是的 我知道这是个很深奥的笑话Yeah, I know, it's a very sophisticated joke--需要时间 很高兴你们消化了it takes a while, but I'm glad you got it.甘地说过一件事One of the things Gandhi said,出自他的精彩自传that he talked about is from his wonderful autobiography,《我的对于真理的实践经历》"My experiment with truth"--"成为你想在世上见到的改变""Be the change you want to see in the world."只有这样才能实现改变This is how you bring about change.我和想大家作个小练习I want to do a quick exercise with you.特别对男生来说是个困难练习This is a tough exercise especially for guys,但请忍耐but please bear with me.感觉不舒服的So-- if you don't feel comfortable doing it,就不要做 希望按下面的指示做don't do it-- what I'd like to do now is as following:让你的姆指和中指Take your thumb and your middle finger尽可能形成一个直角and create as much as possible a 90 degree angle.可能有点痛May hurt a little bit,尽可能形成一个直角but try as much as possible to create a 90 degree angle.看着我 就像这样Ok, watch me: Just like this, Ok?直角90 degree angle.再让这两个手指Now take these two fingers--中指和姆指the middle finger and the thumb--尽可能保持直角时围成一个圆圈and as much as possible, from that 90 degree angle, create a circle.男性比女性更难做到Again, it's more difficult for men than for women--男性的柔韧度更小less flexible.围成一个圆圈Create a circle.看上去像只兔子So it looks like a rabbit.如果能投影的话If you have them on the show.中指和姆指Middle finger exactly and your thumb.好 看着我Alright, just watch me.像这样 尽可能围成一个圆圈Like this. As much as possible.922不是完美的圆但要尽力It's not perfectly round, but as much as possible.把这个围起来的圆圈Now take that circle that you have just created--看到吗? 这是个圆圈Can you see? That's a circle.把这个圆圈放在面颊上Take that circle and put it on your cheek.另一个地方Your other cheek.可能需要一会Ok, this could also take a while.我看到的多数同学都放在了下巴上But most people from what I see, put it on their chin.我很清楚地说是"面颊"Now I said it very clearly, "cheek".问题就在这里But you see, here is the thing:多数人都是照你做的做而不是照你说的做People mostly do what you do, rather than what you say.请记住这一点So remember that,我不认为课堂上有任何人because I don't think there is anyone in this room会告诉我who would tell me now,"我的人生目标是让别人不幸"my goal in life, my objective is to make people miserable.我真得想那么做I really want to do that.我想要世上所有人都不幸"You know I want everyone to be miserable in the world."这里不会有人真得说出那种话 希望如此There is not one person here who would actually say that, I hope.我们在座的多数人 不论做什么So most of us here, whatever we do in our lives,从现在到未来 都是理想主义者now and in the future, are idealists.我们想为世人造福We want to do good in the world;想传播快乐we want to spread happiness.但记住 人们照你做的做But remember, people do what you do,00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:47,220不是照你说得做not what you say.你也许想传播快乐 通过你的言话So you may want to spread happiness, through your word.但最好的方法But ultimately, the best way,传播快乐的最佳方法是努力争取自己的快乐the optimal way spreading happiness is to work on your own happiness,因为那时你就成为榜样because then you are leading by example.这也适用于领导That applies to leadership.领导最重要的不是说的话The most important thing about leadership is not what you say;而是如何以身作则it's what you do.为人父母最重要的The most important thing about parenting--不是告诉子女"诚实很重要"it's not how much you tell your child "honesty is important"而是你自身有多诚实but rather how honest you are.如果你想传播快乐If you want to spread happiness,"成为你想在世上见到的改变" 以身作则"Be the change you want to see in the world." By example.这就是五个基本前提So these are the five basic premises that we talked about.它们构成这门课的基础They formed the foundation of the course.我们将在未来两个月And what we are going to do over the next couple of month扩展这些前提is expand on these--最重要的是如何将研究most importantly, see how we can take the research,原则运用于生活the rigor and apply it to our lives.现在开始下一课So let me move on now to the next lecture,"信念即自我实现预言"which is "Belief as Self-Fulfilling Prophecies".我必须承认This I must say,这个话题点燃了我的想象this topic ignited my imagination当我是孩子时想到它when I was a kid when I thought about it;当我还是一名运动员时when I was an athlete.那时我明白了信念的力量And that's when I understood the power of the mind.后来它挑起我对心理学的兴趣And that would pick my interests in psychology.我想从一个特别的故事开始I want to start with a story, a specific story,在很多方面 它是我听到过的that in many ways I can say it is the first story,第一个有关心理学的故事psychological story that I heard of.那个故事让我明白The story that I heard that brought home to me the message心理学对幸福和成功是多么重要how important psychology is to wellbeing and to success.成功对14岁的壁球手来说And success, as a fourteen years-old squash player,是我生命中最重要的东西was the most important thing in my life.故事讲的是Roger BannisterAnd the story is of Roger Bannister.举下手Just so I get a show of hands:多少人听说过他?好的 只有少数how many people have heard of Roger Bannister? Ok. A handful.听过的可以重温一次So those of you who have, can hear it again.Roger Bannister是个跑手Roger Bannister was a runner.跑一英里He ran the mile.直到1954年 在四分钟以内跑完一英里And until 1954, running the mile in under 4 minutes被认为是不可能的was considered impossible.事实上医生证明四分钟跑一英里In fact, doctors proved the 4 minutes for the mile是人类能力的极限was the limit of human ability.生理学家进行实验Physiologists ran tests,在科学上展示证明人类能力极限showing, proving scientifically the limit of human ability是四分钟跑一英里was running the mile in 4 minutes.不可能少于四分钟You could not go below that.跑手们证明了医生和科学家…And runners proved the doctors and scientists--证明了他们是对的proved that they were right一英里跑四分钟两秒and ran the mile in two seconds and 4 minutes,四分钟一秒 但没有跑手能少于四分钟one second, but no runner could run the mile in under 4 minutes,从一英里跑计时以来ever since the mile was actually timed--当人们开始计时跑时when they started to time runs.那是不可能的 医生和科学家证明了It was impossible-- doctors and scientists showed,跑手 运动员runners, athletes,世上顶尖选手证明了医生们是对的the top-ones in the world proved that the doctors were right.然后Roger Bannister出现And then came along Roger Bannister.他说"四分钟内跑完是可能的Roger Bannister said, "It is possible to run in 4 minutes.我要做给你们看"And in fact, I'm going to do it."说这话时 他是牛津大学的医学博士Now when he said it, he was a medical doctor at Oxford University.也是一名出色的跑手He was a good runner,顶级跑手 但时间远高于四分钟top runner, but nowhere near the 4 minutes mark.他的最好时间是四分12秒His best time was 4 minutes and 12 seconds.自然没有人把他当真And of course, no one took him seriously.但Roger Bannister坚持苦练But Roger Bannister continued to train and work hard,不比别的跑手练得更苦not harder than the rest of the runners,但和世上别的跑手一样苦练but as hard as the top runners in the world.而且有进步And he did get better.他突破了四分十秒In fact, he broke the 4 minutes and 10 seconds mark,四分五秒4 minutes and 5 seconds mark跑到四分两秒时停止and he got 4 minutes and 2 seconds and stopped,像所有人一样like everyone else--无法低于四分二秒could not go below the 4 minutes and 2 seconds.他不是世上最好的跑手So he wasn't even the best runner in the world,但也是佼佼者but among the best.但他还是说"有可能But he continued to say "it is possible;在这件事上人类没有极限there is no human limitation on that;我们能在四分钟之内跑完一英里"we can run the mile in under 4 minutes."他坚持这么做 坚持练习 却一直失败And he continued to say, continued to train for years.直到1954年 1954年5月6日Until 1954. On the 6th of May, 1954,在重回故校时on his home tour at Oxford University,Roger Bannister用了3分59秒跑完一英里Roger Bannister ran the mile in 3 minutes and 59 seconds.轰动一时 登上全世界的头版头条Sensation. Front page news all over the world."科学遭到挑战""医生遭到挑战""Science defied". "Doctors defied"."不可能成为可能""The impossible made possible".它成为梦想一英里It became known as the dream mile.现在听这个Now listen to this.数十年来 自从开始一英里跑计时以来For decades, ever since the mile was timed,没有人突破四分钟界限no one broke the four minute barrier.那被认为是不可能的It was considered impossible.但在5月6日 Roger Bannister特做到了And on the 6th of May, Roger Bannister does it.六周后 澳大利亚跑手John LandySix weeks later, John Landy, the Australian runner,一英里跑了3分57.9秒runs the mile in 3 minutes 57.9 seconds.第二年 1955年The following year, 1955,37名跑手在四分钟内跑完一英里37 runners ran the mile in under 4 minutes.1956年 超过三百名跑手突破四分钟界限1956, over 300 runners break the 4 minute barrier.这是怎么回事?Now what happened?运动员们更加努力训练?Was it that somebody started to train harder?当然不是Of course not.是有了新的技术 新的鞋子?Was it new technologies, new shoes?不是 是信念It wasn't. It was the mind.信念是多么强大Look how powerful the mind is.不是因为跑到那个时间It wasn't the fact that they were running that time就说"不好 超过速度极限了and they say "Oops! We are over the speed limit!放慢速度吧"Let's slow down a little bit."根本不是那样 他们尽了最大努力Not at all! They were trying their hardest,1051最大可能their utmost.然而他们的潜意识限制了他们And yet, their subconscious mind limited them,阻止他们突破界限prevented them from breaking that barrier那不是医生that happened to be not a physical barrier as doctors,生理学家和科学家们声称的身体界限physiologists and scientists had claimed.而是心理界限It was a mental barrier.Roger Bannister攻破了那个要塞And what Roger Bannister did was break down the fort,意志和心理上的要塞the mental psychological fort.信念即自我实现预言Beliefs are self-fulfilling prophecies.它们经常决定我们的表现Very often they determine how we perform,我们表现的多好或多糟how well or how poorly we perform.经常决定我们的人际关系有多好或不那么好They often determine how good or not so good our relationships are.它们是人生成功和幸福的头号预言They are the No. 1 predictor of life success as well as wellbeing,我们将会谈到as we'll talk about.今天和下节课我们要谈的是So what we are going to talk about today and next time信念如何形成现实is how beliefs shape reality.它如何发挥作用?How it works?信念力量背后的机制和科学是什么?What is the mechanism, the science behind the power of the mind?因为在很多方面 这听上去像神秘主义Because in many ways, this sounds like mysticism.一部分是很神秘 仍无法理解And part of it is mystical-- still not understandable--但我们会谈到我们所知的but we are going to talk about as much as we know--信念为什么会起作用及如何起作用why it works and how it works.可惜 人们对乐观主义有很多误解There is unfortunately a lot of misunderstanding about optimism.因为自助运动在很多方面Because the self-help movement in many ways是在告诉我们信念力量是怎么回事is about telling us how it's all about the power of the mind,提到《思考致富》那本书talk about "Think and grow rich", the book;我们会讨论各种秘密we'll talk about the secrets它们如何通过思想创造现实which is about creating our reality through our thoughts.其中有些是事实 但仅是部分And there's some truth to these-- but only some truth.我们将连通象牙塔和主街We are going to bridge Ivory tower and Main Street,说明那个信仰背后的科学和危险and show the science and also the danger behind that belief.1082最重要的是如何应用?Most importantly, how do we apply?如何加强我们的信念How do we enhance the belief in ourselves如果真有这么紧密的关联if there's such high correlation如果希望and there's a very high correlation乐观主义和信念真的and predictive power to a sense of hope,有着非常紧密的关联和预测力to a sense of optimism, to beliefs.如果它们决定我们的产出If they so much determine our outcome,无论在体育场上in the athletic field,还是在工作地点 在人际关系上in the workplace, in a relationship--如果它如此重要 那么该如何加强信念？if it matters so much, then how can we raise our beliefs?我们会谈到Bandura对自我效能的研究And we'll talk about work by Bandura on self-efficacy,1093谈到Nathaniel Branden对自尊的研究or by Nathaniel Branden on self-esteem.如何才能将梦想变成现实How we can make a dream into reality--可以是政治梦想whether it's political dream--我们将谈到马丁路德金的"梦想法"we'll talk about Martin Luther King's dream approach-他是如何做到 做了什么how he did it and what he did;也可以是个人梦想or a personal dream,我们会谈到Herbert Benson和Bandurawhere we'll talk about the work of Herbert Benson as well as Bandura.再一次引用佛的话Once again, the Buddha,"境随心转"We are what we think.全由意念升起All that we are arises with our thoughts.我们的念头造就了世界"With our thoughts, we make our world."这是几千年前的一个主张Again, this was a claim made thousands of years ago.现在我要做的What I want to do now是专注于这个主张的科学基础is focus on the scientific foundation of this claim.我会从皮格马利翁开始讲起And I'll start by talking about Pygmalion in the classroom."Pygmalion"是古希腊语The source of the word, Pygmalion is ancient Greece.皮格马利翁是个雕刻家Pygmalion was a sculptor.成年后他开始寻找理想中的女人And what he did was when he came of age looking for his ideal woman.他想结婚He wanted to get married.他在雅典城里寻找So he went and looked around Athens where he lived;找遍整个希腊he looked around the all of Greece;找遍整个希腊帝国he looked around the Greek Empire;去希腊帝国以外寻找 寻找他理想中的女人he looked beyond the Greek Empire, looking for his ideal woman--一个能和他结婚的女人a woman whom he could marry.00:57:54,650 --> 00:57:56,150但没有找到And he couldn't find her,不论去哪里找no matter where he looked.这是可以理解的I mean it's understandable--那是1879年之前 雷德克利夫学院还没成立this was before 1879 which was when Red Cliff was founded,远在哈佛成为男女合校之前and long before Harvard became co-ed.他找不到理想中的女人 于是他返回雅典So he couldn't find his ideal woman and he went back to Athens.他对自己说And he said to himself."我不再寻找理想中的女人"Well, instead of finding that ideal woman,我要雕刻一座雕像"因为他是雕刻家I will create a sculpture"-- as he was a sculptor,"我会以她的形象雕刻一座雕像""I will create a sculpture in her image."他雕刻出那座雕像And he created that sculpture.当他看着她时And when he looked at her,他被激动之情和悲伤淹没he was so overwhelmed with emotion and sadness因为他找不到她that he couldn't find her,于是他开始哭泣that he began to cry.宙斯 雅典娜 特别是阿芙罗狄蒂And then Zeus, Athena and especially Aphrodite,俯视他 深感同情 于是把雕像变活looking down on him, took mercy and brought the statue to life.当然他们幸福地生活下去And of course, they lived happily ever after.这是这个词的由来So this is the source of the word, Pygmalion.然后萧伯纳借助这个词Pygmalion was then taken by George Bernard Shaw,创作了一部情节类似的戏剧who created a play based on a similar idea后来被改编成音乐剧《窈窕淑女》which was made into a musical, "My Fair Lady".说的是HigginsThe idea here is how Higgins,一位博士 语言学家doctor, linguist,如何把一个卖花女塑造成贵族took a flower girl and molded her in the sense into being royalty.当然故事讲完时What of course happened through the story是她塑造了他 改变了他was that she molded him more and transformed him.非常精彩的故事 当时很重要的故事Fascinating story and very important story at the time.因为它挑战了整个阶级体系Because it challenged the whole class system,人生来就有阶级 不能that people are born into a certain place and cannot--也不应该被改变and should not-- be moved.在当时是很重要的戏剧 今天也是如此So a very important play at that time, as well as today.皮格马利翁和人是可以被改变About Pygmalion and people can be changed,被改造的can be transformed.1960年代In the 1960s,Robert Rosenthal曾在本系担任多年主任Robert Rosenthal who was the head of our department for many years--现在就职加州大学河滨分校he's now in UC Riverside--00:59:57,850 --> 01:00:01,把皮格马利翁的思想应用于课堂took this idea of Pygmalion and applied it in the classroom.他是这么做的 Rosenthal随便走进几间学校Here is what he did. Rosenthal went into a group of random schools.去到学生中间And what he did there was went to the students,让他们接受一次测验had them take a test然后去找他们的老师并告诉他们and then go to their teachers after and tell the teachers,"你们的学生刚接受了一个新测试"Your students just took a new test that was devised--一种新的学业测试 叫作快速迸发者测试"a new academic test which is called "the fast spurters' test".测试能让我们找出What that means is that we identify students将在新学年在学业上who are going to take a big leap,取得巨大进步的学生intellectual leap forward in this coming year,在新学年取得巨大进步a spurt forward in this coming year.换言之 他的意思是In other words, what he was saying--测试找出最有潜力的学生it identifies students with highest potential.他发现…And what he found then was when he told these students--他对这些老师说的是the teachers-- what he told these teachers was that"这只是仅供参考 不能向学生透露"it is just not a FYI-- you cannot tell the students this.我们不希望学校有歧视行为We don't want any discrimination in your school,只是让你们知道 这些学生有巨大潜力but just so you know, these are your fast spurters.这是一项新发明的测试It's a new test, newly devised.只有你们知道就好"老师们不知道的是Just so you know." Unbeknownst to the teachers,对学生进行的测试the actual test which was given to those students只是普通的现成的智商测试was a regular off-the-shelf IQ test.老师们也不知道这些所谓的Also unbeknownst to the teachers was these students names,"快速迸发者"或者潜力巨大的学生who were deemed "the fast spurters"/"high potential students",都是从一个帽子抓阄抓出来的were literally randomly picked out from a hat.他们都是普通学生So there were regular students,和别的学生没有区别like all other students,但老师们以为他们有巨大潜力but the teachers thought they were "fast spurters".Robert Rosenthal离开学校Robert Rosenthal leaves the school,学年结束时再回来comes back in the end of the year.他发现 他查看他们的英语成绩And here's what he finds-- he looks at their English scores:"快速迸发"学生有明显进步the "fast spurters" improved significantly比任何学生的进步都快more than any of the other students.他查看他们的数学成绩He looked at their maths scores,因为英语不够客观because English is not really objective也许是老师们and you know maybe it was the teachers觉得某些学生英语更好who thought they were better than they were really.于是他查看他们的数学 客观的成绩So he looked at their maths, their objective scores.这些学生也有明显进步These students improved significantly比其他任何学生的进步都大more than any of the other students.接下来才是有决定性的结果But here is the clincher:Robert Rosenthal又对所有学生Robert Rosenthal administered once again an IQ test进行了一次智商测试for all the students.他发现被标签为And what he found was the students who were labeled--被随机地标签为"快速迸发"的学生randomly so, but who were labeled--智商在一年间有很大增加"fast spurters", their IQ increased significantly over the year而且在长期研究中保持着增加and maintained that increase in a longitudinal study.这让人不解Now this is my bog I mean:智商IQ is supposed to be in your intelligent quotient本来是生而有之的that you are born with!它是恒定的It's immutable.1205从出生到死亡时都不会改变It doesn't change from the day you were born to the day you die--或者说他们这样认为or so they thought.但它却因为It changed significantly just based the belief老师对学生的信念而改变that the teacher had in her/his students.信念即自我实现预言Belief as self-fulfilling prophecies.这项研究说明了什么？What happened in the study?老师们被骗了吗？Was it that the teachers were fooled?突然产生幻象? 不是的And suddenly were made to see an illusion? No.01:03:09,190 --> 01:03:11,500是因为他们之前被欺骗It was that they were alluded before.幻象是他们看不到and the illusion was that they didn't see就在他们眼前的东西what is right in front of their very eyes,即每个学生都有潜力which is the potential inherent in every single student.Robert Rosenthal来到 可以说是骗了他们And then Robert Rosenthal comes and fools them in a sense,01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:30,410"骗"他们注意到一直在眼前的东西but "fools" them into seeing what has been there all along.在那之前 他们没注意到车上的孩子Before Rosenthal, they didn't see children on the bus.可以这么说So to speak.之后 突然他们在一些孩子身上After that, they suddenly in some children看到一直都有的潜力saw the potential that was there all along.他们欣赏那种潜力 潜力得到升值And they appreciated that potential and that potential appreciated.他们灌溉 播撒阳光They watered, they shed a light to it种子开始发芽生长and the seed germinated and grew.这正是Marva Collins每天在学校里做的事This is exactly what Marva Collins does day in and day out in school.她看到存在的潜力She seed the potential that is there;她不是发明家she's not even inventing something.没有脱离现实She's not detached from reality.是人们看不到他人身上的潜力It's rather the people who don't see the potential in other people也看不到自己身上的潜力 我们会讨论到as well as in themselves as we'll discuss.他们没有看到整个现实They are not seeing the full reality.只看到一部分They are only seeing part of it.完全无视车上的孩子们They are completely missing the children on the bus.我们知道无视一部分现实是多么容易And we know how easy it is to miss part of reality,就算他们就在我们眼前even they are right in front of our very eyes.经常需要被问及Or it often takes a question--问及我们之前忽略了什么it takes on the quest and we miss what we have seen before,不论是对风险人口的研究whether it was research with at-risk population,或者是人口结构whether it was the geometric shapes,或者只是对我们的whether it was asking only the negative questions人际关系和自己提出负面问题about our relationship or about ourselves,或者没有看到or whether it's not seeing the potential每个孩子身上都有的潜力that exist in just about all kids.如果我们看到它If only we see it.只要我们看到它And if we see it,欣赏它 灌溉它appreciate it, we water it,播撒阳光we shed a light to it,它就会感恩 成长and it appreciates, it grows.Rosenthal做的只是将他们注意力So what Rosenthal did was simply shift their attention to something转移到一直在那里的东西上that was there all along.在工作场所也是如此Same in the workplace.几百几千次地重复着Replicated hundreds, thousands of times--皮格马利翁效应the Pygmalion effect.曾在一个工作场所里重演过It was replicated in a workplace主管或经理被告知 这些是where leaders are told or managers are told "these are your top,极有潜力的员工highest potential employees".那些员工也是随机挑出的And these employees, again, randomly picked,但真的变成最有潜力的员工actually became the highest potential employees.并取得更大成功And they succeeded much more.他们的保持力增加 工作表现出色Retention went up for them; performance went up;在公司更有可能被升职they were more likely to advance in their organization并留在公司里and stay in their organization.这都只是期望产生的结果Just as result of expectation.角色调换后结结果一样The source of works of the other way,Jamison在1997年做了一项很有趣的研究Jamison, back in 1997, this fascinating study,她想知道角色调换后是否有相同结果where what she said was let's see if it works the other way.她去到由同一名老师负责的两个班So she went to two classes that were taught by the same teacher,开始上课之前and before the classes were started,只告诉一个班told just one of the classes这位老师受到that this teacher was ranked extremely highly从前学生的极大好评by other students before,他们作为心理学家that they, as professional psychologists rated给这名老师极高的评价that teacher as extremely high.然后他们离开两个班And they left them.学年结束时 情况如何？What happened by the end of the year?首先 干预组给这名老师的评价First of all, the teacher was rated higher高于对照组by the intervention group than by the control group.而且学生对课业But also, the students put in actually more time付出更多时间 成绩比对照组好into the class and they outperformed the control group.因为他们相信Because they believed--他们被欺骗相信they were made to believe that这位老师的水平比实际情况高the teacher was better that supposedly he/she were.换言之 学生看到老师身上的潜力In other words, they saw the potent6ial in the teacher.学生们表现得…与老师无关They performed-- not only the teacher;老师没有更好的表现the teacher did perform better--但学生表现得更好了but the students actually performed better当他们有更高的期望时when they had high expectations,当他们相信自己的老师时when they believed in their teachers.如果各位想学好1504这门课So if you want to do well in 1504--你们知道该怎么做了 是吗？you'll know what you need to do, right?真得管用 信念即自我完成预言It works-- beliefs as self-fulfilling prophecies.我们创造我们的现实 歌德说过We create our reality. Goethe,"人是怎样便怎样待他 他便还是那样的人"Treat a man as he is and he will remain as he is.一个人能够或应该怎样便怎样待他Treat a man as he can and should be,他便会成为能够怎样或是应当怎样的人"and he shall become as he can and  should be."现在我想谈一个相关话题I want to move on now to a related topic,它对心理学家很重要one that is very important for psychologist对生活应用也很重要but also for you to apply in your life.那就是我们创造的情境And that is the importance of situation we create或为我们创造的情境的重要性or that is created for us.在很多方面 心理学家In many ways, psychologist--肯定地说是社会心理学家social psychologist for sure--都会被在情境之下完成的was sponged by a series of research一系列研究所影响that was done on the power of the situation,但多数是消极的情境but it was mostly the negative power of the situation.修读或没修读过初级心理学的Those of you taken psych 1, those of you haven't,可能都听说过"阿施从众心理实验"may have heard of the "Asch Conformity Experiment",个体对群体存在从众现象where people conformed to the idea of the group.很多同学可能听说过Or many of you probably heardMilgram的"权力服从"of Milgram's "The obedience to authority".如果没听说过If you haven't heard about them,我不会在这里深入介绍I am not going to go in depth here,阅读了解一下 去网上找一下read about it. Just Google it.两者都是心理学领域Some of the most important fascinating studies最精彩的研究 在街上随便找个人in the field of psychology where a person off the street在实验者的指示去电击另一个人was told by an experimenter to shock another person,甚至电击到另一个人尖叫恳求停止even to the point where the other person is screaming to stop.因为实验者说实验必须进行下去And because the experimenters were saying the experiment must go on而且实验者经常穿着一件白大褂and very often had a white cloak like doctors or experimenters--就像医生或者实验者a cloak around them.因为他们说实验必须进行下去Because they said the experiment must go on,经常的 人们会very often, people went--多数人 美国人都会继续电击那个人most people, Americans went on and shocked that person,甚至电击到另一个人哭泣even to the point of the other person whimpering恳求放他出去and begging to be let out,仅仅是因为那一句simply because of the word,"实验必须进行下去""the experiment must go on".情境的力量 对权力的服从The power of the situation, obedience to authority--这项研究的目的是为了证明this was done in order to show how something like the Holocaust为什么大屠杀只发生在德国could only happen in Germany;那里的人更容易服从权力how people are more likely to be obedient to authority他们发现全世界的人and what they found globally, worldwide,都倾向服从权力people have the tendency to be obedient to authority,不论是在美国还是德国whether it was in United States or in Germany.全世界都是如何Around the world.如出一辙 情境的力量Same replicated. The power of the situation.Philip Zimbardo的监狱实验Philip Zimbardo's Prison Experiment.在斯坦福进行 他们做的是This was done at Stanford, where they did was taking--没读过的找来读again, read about it if you haven't;我不会深入介绍I am not going to go in depth here--他们从街上随便找来一些人where they took people off the street分别扮演典狱长and had them play the role of either the prison warden,狱警和犯人the guard or the prisoner.这项实验预计进行两周And the experiment was supposed to go on for two weeks证明进入角色的效果to show what entering a role does.一周后 他们发现And what they found was after a week,实验必须终止the experiment had to be stopped.因为随意找来的 随机分配的典狱长们Because the wardens-- people off the street, randomly divided-变得非常残暴were becoming so oppressive.他们侮辱犯人They humiliated the prisoners进入犯人角色的人受到侮辱who got into their position of being humiliated,就像犯人经常感受到的侮辱just like prisoners often felt.这解释了Abu Ghraib监狱丑闻This explains Abu Ghraib.时事现象You know, current phenomenon--伊拉克战俘的遭遇what happened in the Iraqi prisons,随便一个人一旦进入角色of how people off the street enter the role--他们进入得太深they entered the role so muchZimbardo不得不在一周后终止实验that Zimbardo had to stop the experiment after one week.可以去视频网站上看到Go on YouTube and watch the video about this mind-boggling stuff.这是很重要的So this is only important,知道很好 知道很重要 但不够good to know,important to know, but not enough.因为情境如此强大Because the situation is so powerful,为什么只强调消极的东西？why just emphasize the negative?为什么不创造积极的环境Why not think about creating positive situations让我们获得更快乐更讲道德的生活?that will help us lead happier, more moral lives?正像很多积极心理方法一样And this has, just like a lot of positive psychological approaches,被21比1的比率忽视has been ignored with a ratio 21 to 1.我要和大家分享这个领域的两项研究So let me share with you just a couple of studies in this area.两项研究都由本校的Ellen Langer完成Both of them done by our very own Ellen Langer.顺便说一句 我现在要讲到的这项研究This, by the way, is the study that I am going to share now是即将推出的Langer教授记录片的主干is going to be backbone of a movie coming out about Professor Langer--扮演Ellen Langer的演员 Langer是the person who's going to play Ellen Langer--1374心理学系的第一位女性终身教授she's the first female tenure professor in the psychology department扮演Ellen Langer的是詹妮弗安妮斯顿the person who's going to play Ellen Langer is Jennifer Aniston.电影有望在一年后上映And the movie is coming out, hopefully in a year,但电影讲的是我要谈到的这项实验but it's about the experiment that I am going to share with you now.实验在1979年进行So this was done in 1979.Langer的实验是Here was what Langer did.她找来What she did was take men75岁以上的男人 把他们送去一座别墅who were above 75 years old and sent them to a retreat,那是间以1959为主题的别墅which was a 1959 retreat, meaning--虽然实验在1979年进行even though it was 1979--音乐来自1959年the music was from 1959,他们读的杂志都是1959年前后的the magazines that they read that were all around were 1959,日报是1959年的the daily newspapers were 1959--所有的一切都是1959年的everything was 1959.就算他们要进入角色Even they had to go into a role,和Zimbardo的实验一样just like in Zimbardo,要扮演1959年时的角色 仿佛年轻了20岁they had to play their role of 1959 as if they were 20 years younger.这是个心理学实验Now of course, it was a psychological experiment,在实验前后进行各种测量they had all these different measures, taken before/after.他们发现And here is what they found.在别墅待了一周One week. Retreat.在一周结束时At the end of the week,在一周结束时At the end of the week,心理和生理年纪都减小了both mental and biological age decreased.比如 他们在各项测试中变得更灵活For example, they became more flexible in tests.他们变得更强壮 他们手掌 双腿They became stronger-- their grasp, their legs,身体都变得更强壮their bodies became stronger.他们的记忆力有明显改善Their memory improved significantly,他们的智力水平so their intelligence level as taking在实验前后进行测试 再与对照组相比by tests before and after compared to control group在仅仅一周后就有明显改进improved significantly after a single week.她测量指骨间的距离She measured the distance between the bones in the finger,人越老 骨骼间空隙变得越小because when we get older, the space becomes smaller--指骨变得更紧they become tighter.一周后 他们的手指变长The length after a week, increased in their fingers.他们变得更快乐They became happier.变得更加自立They became more self-sufficient,更少依懒他们 不论是他们自己less dependent on other people as rated by themselves还是家庭成员的评估都是如此and as rated by their family members.他们变得更健康They became healthier.他们的视力和听觉有明显改善Their eyesight and hearing improved significantly在短短一周时间内in as little as a week.就是因为他们进入了强大的积极的情境Just because they entered a powerful, positive situation,与在外面世界遭遇的which goes against a lot of the stereotypes典型情况和偏见不同and prejudices that they encountered in the outside world.仅仅通过"扮演"某个角色So just by "acting" a certain role,他们变成那个角色 正如Zimbardo的犯人they became that role just like Zimbardo's prisoners在短短一周内真的变成犯人became their role in as little as a week.她的另一项研究Another study that she did--她在书中有叙述and this is a report in her book,《念》 我强烈推荐这本书"Mindfulness", which I highly recommend.她测量人们的视力She took in and tested people's eyesight.给他们一幅普通的视力表And she gave them a normal eyesight chart,测量他们的视力 记录结果measured them, wrote down their performance.然后她把让同一群人And then she took the exact same people--这次让他们穿上飞行服this time, put them in a pilot overalls同时让他们坐进飞行模拟器and at the same time put them in a flight simulator然后给他们看完全相同的视力表and showed them the exact same the eye chart.相同的距离 相同的视力表Same distance, same eye chart,唯一的不同是 他们坐在the only difference being they're sitting in a flight simulator飞行模拟器里 穿着飞行服and they were wearing pilot overalls.他们坐在那里看视力表They were sitting there, looking at the eye chart.然后她又进行了一次视力测试And again, she ran the eye test.40%的参与者的视力有明显改善40% of participants eyesight improved significantly,仅仅是在改变情境的情况下as a result of just changing the situation.相同的距离 相同的表 什么都一样Same distance, same chart, same everything.只是情境不同Different situation.问题是我们如何创造积极情境The question is how do we create a positive situation.如何创造一个利用角色自我改进的情境How can we create a situation that improves us with the role.我想介绍两个研究And I want to share with you couple of studies--先说第一个再说第二个 关于环境I'll share one study and then another later-- about the environment.首先是Barge的研究First of all, the work of Barge,影射分为潜意识和有意识影射priming is when we have subconscious or conscious priming.比如你看着一个屏幕For example, you are looking at a screen在几毫秒内闪过一个词and for just a few milliseconds, a word appears.这个词让你有了准备And the word primes you.有很多关于如何利用There is a lot of research on典型消极情况进行影射的研究 比如how we can prime your negatively with stereotypes for example,使用偏见with prejudices.或者积极的 但对积极影射的研究不够Or positively-- but not enough from positively.Barge做了下面的实验So here's a story done by Barge.他用与"老"有关的词影射人He primed people with words associated with old.比如"老"这个词So for example, word such as old,"拐杖"word such as stick,"佛罗里达"word such as Florida--他用这个词影射人们that's one of the words he primed people with.他用与老有关的词影射人们So he primed people with "old" words.然后他对比他们和对照组的And then he had them take a comparative and control group智力和记忆力测试结果an intelligence test and a memory test.用与"老"相关的词影射过的人的记忆力The memory of the people who were primed with "old" words.他们的表现比对照组差They performed the worst than the control group.第二 他观察这些人Second, he looked at these people记录他们从实验地点and measured how fast they walk from走到电梯的时间where their experiment was to the elevator.还找来盲测员And also had blind evaluators--那些不了解情况的人people who didn't know which condition they were in,评估他们的走路evaluate how they were walking.用"老"影射过的人行走起来So the people who were primed with old actually walked真得比其他人更弯腰驼背more stoop than the other people.走向电梯的速度明显慢And they walk significantly slower toward the elevator,虽然不知道自己被与"老"相关的字影射过not knowing that they were primed with old words.但他们走向电梯的速度They walk slower toward the elevator.,比没有受到影响的人慢then the people who were not primed with these old words,完全是潜意识的subconscious completely.然后他们用与"成就"相关的词And then they did something priming people with words影射人们related to an achievement.受到影射的人The people who were primed,用与"成就"有关的词进行潜意识影射的人subconsciously with words related to achievement,测试结果比对照组好did better on tests than control group.他们的记忆力得到改进Their memory improved,面对困难任务时更有持久力and they persisted more on difficult tasks.问题是…下次课我会谈到的是And the question is-- the thing we'll talk about next time--如何创造有意识的is how can we create consciously和潜意识的积极环境and subconsciously a positive environment让我们带出最有道德where we actually can take out the most moral,最成功的自我 并且去欣赏那个自我most successful self, to appreciate that self,帮助环境带出最杰出的自己to help the environment bring out the best in us.下堂课见Next time.
