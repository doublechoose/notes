幸福课 中英字幕 [第5课]环境的力量
我想介绍一位来自"为美国而教"的代表
I'd like to introduce a representative from "Teach for America"
这个组织一直致力于做好事
which is an organization that has done and is doing a lot of good,
在世界上宣扬善 我想…
promoting goodness in the world and I'd like to--
这门课 过去两年一直向他们提供支持
in 1504, we've been supporting them for the last 2 years
我们希望继续下去
and we'd like to continue to do that.
有请
So please.
大家好 能听到吗？
Hello. Can you hear me?
非常感谢
Thank you so much for this.
我只占用90秒
I will take 90 seconds.
我叫Josh Bieber
My name is Josh Bieber.
好的 我感觉很好
Alright. I feel positive.
我是为美国而教的成员 现在为组织工作
I was a Teacher for America Corp member and I now work for TFA.
负责新址开展
I do new site development.
大四时
So when I was a senior,
我勉强认为这是个机会
I had marginally considered this is an option.
招聘到期日 固执的组织招募人员
I had a napping for a very pushy phone call
打来电话 听电话时我差点睡着
from a very pushy TFA recruiter on the deadline day--
我本不会应聘
I would not apply.
但我还是磨蹭了两小时完成短文
But I hesitantly took two hours to fill that essays
多亏那个打来电话的人
and now owe her for or owe that phone call for
这是我人生最美好 最快乐的两年
the best two years of my life and truly the happiest.
请再给我一分钟
So if I have 60 seconds,
希望大家对组织有两个了解
there are just two things that I want people to know about TFA.
我想你们知道组织的目的
I think you know what we are.
一是这个国家对学校里的
One, is that this country does not serve all kids
孩子们的教育是不平等的
in our schools fairly.
低收入孩子在离开小学前
So low-income kids before they even leave elementary school
已落后多年
are years behind where they should be.
其中不到一半能高中毕业
And nearly not even a half of them graduate high school,
这非常不公正
which is like, a terrible injustice,
完全的不公正
a complete injustice.
二 你们能带来改变
Two, you can actually make a difference.
我开始也怀疑组织
I was as skeptical as they come about TFA
和自己的能力
and my ability and all the rest.
但我知道这是真的
But I know this to be true.
如果你走进一个五年级教室
If you walk into a class with 5th graders,
学生们从第一天开始就落后很多
who on day one are years behind where they should be
恨学校 因此也恨你
and hate school and are kind of like to hate you because of it.
九个月后
And nine months later,
他们成绩优异
they leave honor above great level,
恳求更多作业
begging for some more work
希望与你共度周未
and wanting to hang out with you on the weekend.
让你觉得一切都有可能
You kinda think that anything is possible.
我在此足以说明
And that's clearly I am here now.
"为美国而教"对我来说是一个
So for me, Teach for America is an opportunity
真正让我实现想法和希望的地方
to actually align my actions with my thoughts and my hopes
参与实现我们都想见到的改变
and be part of the change we all talk about wanting to see.
我愿意鼓励所有同学
So I would encourage you all,
不管你们计划明年做什么
regardless of what you think you may do next year,
请大家超越那些想法 考虑这个机会
or you may go beyond that to like, really consider this.
它是我可能做过的最好的事
It was the best thing that I could've done.
最后期限是明天
The final deadline is tomorrow.
很容易做 不需要推荐
It's easy to do. You don't need rex.
申请就行
Just apply.
给自己机会
And give yourself the chance
像我一样爱上这份工作
to fall in love with it the way that I did.
最后我想说
And I will just end by saying,
现在坐在教室里的同学们
if you are in this room right now,
可能获得同龄人中最好的教育
you've probably had the best education anyone your age,
世界上最好的教育
anywhere could possibly have.
我们的学生和学校需要你们
Our students and our schools need you.
请加入我们
So please join us.
感谢给我的时间
Thank you very much for the time.
64
祝大家上堂精彩的课
And have a good class.
大家好 只说几句
Hi everyone. Quickly.
如果这里有公开课学生或本科生
If there are any extension students or undergraduate students
不能在这周来上课的
who were not able to make section this week,
今晚七点半有一堂开放课
we have an open section tonight at 730.
是为公开课学员制作的录像
That'll be videotaped for the extension school.
有时间和兴趣上课的
So if you are available and interested in attending that,
请在课后来找我
please come and see me after class.
谢谢
Thanks.
现在我想介绍两位挚友
I'd like to introduce now two very dear friends
积极心理学的支持者
and supporters of positive psychology
可能比任何人
who are doing arguably more than anyone else
更致力推广积极心理学
to disseminate the ideas of positive psychology
以严谨和有趣的方式
in a rigorous and fun way.
我请他们简单介绍一下
I've asked them to give a brief presentation
宾州大学应用积极心理学硕士课程
about the Masters of Applied Positive Psychology at U Penn,
唯一的硕士学位
the only master degree,
世界上第一个硕士学位
well the first master degree in the world--
目前还有其他几个
there are a couple of others now.
他们会简单介绍一下
And they'll talk a little bit about--
利用15分钟时间 介绍一下硕士课程
for 15 minutes-- about the masters,
然后再开始今天的课程
before we jump into our material today,
希望让人兴奋
which hopefully will be exciting.
有请James和Debbie
So-- James and Debbie, please.
非常感谢
Thank you very much, Tal.
很高兴能来到这里
It's great to be here with you guys.
和你们共度几分钟 真是乐事
What a delight to be able to spend a few minutes with you
在这样特别的课堂上
and such a very special class,
在这里你们将积极心理学的科学
where you are combining the science of positive psychology
和应用合二为一
with its practice.
当然你们很快就知道
And of course, as you very quickly figure out,
Tal是位杰出的教授
Tal is such a master teacher,
能把复杂的概念
somebody who is able to take complex ideas
变得简单易懂 又不过份简单
and make them simple without making them simplistic
而且发人深省
and also making it inspiring
让讲座富于感召力
and making the presentation motivating
使我们想出去应用学到的理念
so that we want to go out and apply the ideas that we are studying.
我想知道有多少人
I'm curious-- how many of you here
对将积极心理学应用于
are interested in applying the science of positive psychology
生活中感兴趣
in your own personal life as part of why you are her.
请举手?
Can I see your hands?
好 很好
Ok. Great.
有多少人选择这门课
How many of you are here because you are also
是因为有兴趣在未来事业中
potentially interested in applying the science of positive psychology
应用积极心理学
in your future career decisions,
在工作中? 好的
in your job eventually? Ok.
很好 好极了
Great. Excellent.
希望你们起码能那么做
I hope you do just that.
那些有兴趣
For those of you who are interested in taking positive psychology,
深入学习积极心理学的学生
studies of positive psychology deeper
在研究生程度课程获取知识
at graduate level program for your own knowledge,
但同样能够
but also to be able to take
将所学带入事业
what you are learning into your profession,
我们很高兴能够向你们介绍
we're delighted to be able to tell you
一下宾州大学的
a little bit about the master of applied positive psychology program
积极心理学硕士课程
at the University of Pennsylvania,
谈谈将积极心理学
and to talk a little bit about taking positive psychology
从课堂带向世界
from the classroom to the world.
你们知道积极心理学刚刚诞生十年
Now as you know, positive psychology is just about 10 years old.
始于1998年 Martin Seligman
It was started in 1998, when Martin Seligman
美国心理学协会当时的主席
was the president of the American Psychological Association.
积极心理学是他主持开创的
And positive psychology was one of his presidential initiatives.
四年前
About 4 years ago,
Martin Seligman创办积极心理学中心
Martin Seligman started the positive psychology center
在宾州大学
at the University of Pennsylvania.
积极心理学中心的使命
And the mission of the positive psychology center
是推广研究 培训
is to promote research, training,
教育和传播积极心理学
education and dissemination of positive psychology.
2005年一月
So in January, 2005,
我加入积极心理学中心
I joined the positive psychology center
任教育主任和高级学者
as the director of education and senior scholar.
2005年二月
The next month, in February of 2005,
Debbie Swick加入中心任教育助理主任
Debbie Swick came on board as the associate director of education.
我们的任务是编制硕士课程
Our task was to create a master program
并在秋季推出
and have an up and running by the fall.
我一月加入 Debbie二月加入
So again, I got there in January, Debbie came in February.
三月完成论出
We got our brochure out,
印刷并出版
printed and published in March.
申请的最后期限是四月
Our application deadline was April.
我猜有点乐天派
Kind of an optimistic, I suppose?
我们不知道是否有人报读
And we didn't know if anybody would show up.
不知是否有人感兴趣
We didn't know if anybody would be interested.
但我们不需要担心
We needn't have worried.
我们收到超过一百份申请表
We got over 100 applications
秋天时收了36名学生
and we accepted 36 students into our program for that fall.
后来的收生情况越来越好
And things have just been really going well and hopping ever since.
这是我们当前的学生
This is our current class.
2007年秋天 开课第一天
On their first day of class in the fall of 2007,
今年一共收录41名学生
we have 41 students in our class this year.
00:07:37,850 --&gt; 00:07:41,150
我想多介绍一点学生情况
So I'd just like to tell you a little bit more about the students.
我们有三名毕业生或在读生
Actually three of our graduates or current students
是这门课的助教
are teaching fellows in this class.
让人兴奋
So that's exciting.
Debbie Coen和Elizabeth Johnston
Debbie Coen, Elizabeth Johnston-- where are you?
请站起来
You guys, please stand up.
还有Elizabeth Peterson 很好
And Elizabeth Peterson. Great.
看左上角
If you look at the up left corner,
两年前 Gabriel修读这门课
Gabriel was a student here in this class two years ago,
在我们来推广硕士课程时
when we came and presented on the program
现在他正在我校读硕
and he is currently a student in the MAPP program.
这门课和我们的硕士课程
So there is a lot of synergy going back and forth
有很多合作
between this class and our master program.
我们的学生年纪从22岁到62岁
Our student age range from 22 to 62.
来自美国各地
They come from all across United States,
佛蒙特 弗罗里达 加州
from Vermont to Florida, to California.
来自世界各地
They come from around the world:
我们的学生来自英国 挪威
we have students from UK, from Norway,
瑞士 印度
Switzerland, India,
马来西亚 日本 香港
Malaysia, Japan, Hong Kong,
南韩和新西兰
South Korea and New Zealand.
25%到30%的学生是年轻人
About 25% to 30% of our students are younger students
刚刚大学毕业
who are just out of college
希望在进行职业训练之前
and are looking to immerse themselves in positive psychology
先深入学习积极心理学
before going on into their professional training.
其余学生是专业人士
The rest of our students are professionals
来自各行各业
who come from a wide variety of professions.
在第一班里
In our first class,
学生中有来自苏格兰的
we had the former chief social worker inspector
全国前社工总监
for the entire country of Scotland within the class.
那很有趣
That was very interesting.
肾移植医生
We had kidney transplant surgeon,
摩根大通的前副主席
former Vice President of JP Morgan;
律师 非牟利发展计划的主任
we had attorneys, Directors of Development for Non-Profits;
学校的常务董事
executive director of school,
Carlbrook Academy今年选择了我们的课
Carlbrook Academy is in our class this year;
人力资源主管
human resources directors,
咨询师 执行教练
consultants, executive coaches,
甚至音乐家和喜剧演员
even professional musician and professional comedian.
班里的学生可谓五花八门
So it is quite a cross cut of students in the class.
我想用两分钟
Just in a couple of minutes,
简单介绍一下教学设计
I want to give you a little bit more sense of what educational design
再简介一下课程内容
is and just a brief over view of the course work.
本课程是一年制全日制学习
So this MAPP program is a one calendar year, full-time study.
九月开始 八月毕业
Students begin in September and end in August.
我们的教育设计是混合模式
The educational design is hybrid model--
每个月 学生
so once a month, students are on class,
有一次现场教学
on site, for intensive on site classes.
其余时间
And then in the intervening periods,
学生通过远程学习模式完成
they are on distant learning modules that the students complete.
203
这是一个职业硕士学位
This is a professional master degree.
教学重点放在
And it focuses on
积极心理学理论
the theory and the application of positive psychology
206
及在各行各业的应用
in various professional domains.
目前来说
So at this point,
积极心理学
there is not a separate licensing or credentialing
还没有独立的执照或证书
in positive psychology itself.
学生来自教育
Students come from education,
商业 法律 医疗等各个领域
business, law, medicine, etc,
都有自己的文凭
bringing in their own credentials with them.
让学生每月来校一次
So this design of having students on campus
进行现场教学的设计
once a month for intensive classes
允许学生继续全职工作
allows students to continue working full time.
我刚说过
Now just as I said,
课程是全日制的 你可能奇怪
the program is full time and you may be wondering,
"怎么可能一边工作一边全日上课"
"How can students work full time and study full time."
请记住这是一个职业学位
Keep in mind this is a professional degree
高级管理人员教育模式
and executive education model
就是为那些
that is intended to be designed for people
全职工作的人员设计的
who are themselves working full time
同时上全制日课程
and still taking classes full time.
多数学生继续
So most of our students continue their work
他们从事的工作
they've been doing,
继续全职工作同时又能上课
continuing working full time when they come to our class.
这种模式的另一个优势
Another advantage of this model
是不需要学生居住在宾州附近
is students aren't required to live in Philadelphia.
学生从全国各地赶来
Students can commute in from across United States.
即让我们惊讶且欣喜的是
And what has been a surprise and pleasure to us:
远在欧洲和亚洲的学生
students have decided to commute
也决定赶来
in from as far away as Europe and Asia.
我不知道现在你们如何来上课
I don't know today what you commute was like to come to class.
但我们的一些学生
But some of our students come
每月从南韩和新西兰赶来
as far away as South Korea and New Zealand every month
参加积极心理学课程
to be part of the positive psychology classes.
可以想象
So you can imagine that
为课堂带去的兴奋和活力
adds real excitement and energy to the class
也给教授施加了压力 我们要确保
and puts a little bit pressure on the professors to make sure that
能传授值得绕半个地球赶来学习的知识
we have something worth coming half way around the world for.
学生的多样性
This enhances the educational experience obviously
提升了教学体验
by increasing student diversity:
居住在海外的学生
we have students who are living abroad
赶来上课
and coming in for the classes.
我们还聘请多位教授
And also we are able to tap into the expertise of professors,
不局限于宾州大学
not just at the University of Pennsylvania,
还有其他大学
but also at other schools as well
我们请来最杰出的研究员
so that we can bring in the very top leading researchers
和积极心理学的从业者
and practitioners of positive psychology.
简单概述2008年秋的现场教学
A brief overview of the schedule of on-site classes on the fall 2008:
春季有五个
you can see that there are five different intensive
现场教学周未
on-site weekends in the spring
其余时间是远程教学
as well with distant learning and intervening times.
简介一下课程
So just very briefly, the courses--
每位学生秋季上四门课
each student takes four courses in the fall,
春季上四门课 然后是总结性课程
four courses in the spring and then the capstone course.
秋季时
In the fall,
课程集中介绍积极心理学的基础理论
the courses focus on the foundational theory of positive psychology:
Martin Seligman教
Martin Seligman teaches the Introduction
积极心理学课程概述
to Positive Psychology course;
Angela Duckworth教研究手段与评估
Angela Duckworth teaches a course on Research Methods and Evaluation
让学生
it is very important for our students
真正把握积极心理学科学很重要
to have a real good grasp of the science of positive psychology,
理解结论背后的研究手段
understanding other research methods behind the results;
我教积极心理学原理
I teach a course in the foundation of positive interventions;
第四门课是"通向美好人生的方法"
and then our fourth course is Approaches to the Good Life,
请来多位杰出的研究人员
where we have different leading researchers come in
讨论他们的研究
and talk about their research.
春季 我们的课程
In the spring, our courses focus,
不再以理论为焦点
not so much on the theory,
而是转向积极心理学的应用
but now move to the application of positive psychology
因为这是应用积极心理学硕士学位
since it's a master of applied positive psychology.
不知道你们是否学习了"特长与美德"
I don't know if you study yet "the character strengths and virtues",
Chris Peterson的"价值和行为分类"
the values and the action classification by Chris Peterson.
如果还没有学习
If you haven't done that yet,
我肯定不久会学到
I'm sure you shortly will.
他也会教授有关自己研究的课程
He himself comes in and teaches a course on the work he has done.
我教积极干预应用
I teach a course on applied positive interventions
课程也包括一个服务教育部分
and we have a service learning component as a part of that class.
Karen Reivich和Judith Saltzberg Levick
Karen Reivich and Judith Saltzberg Levick
教积极心理学和个体
teach a course on positive psychology and individual--
即在与他人的人际关系上
so this is how to use positive psychology relationally
如何应用积极心理学
with other people,
不论是在工作中 还是与朋友家人在一起时
whether it's in working environment or with friends or family.
最后一门课
And then finally,
不知你们是否熟习"肯定式探询"
I don't know if you are familiar with appreciative inquiry--
如果不知道
again, I expect, if you not,
我想Tal会在本学期向大家介绍
Tal will be introducing it to you during the course this semester
David Cooperrider是这个领域的先驱
David Cooperrider is the leader of this field of inquiry,
将积极心理学方法
which basically takes positive psychology approaches
带入组织 并致力寻求改变
into organizations and seeks to foster change at the level,
不只是个人
not just individuals,
而是整体水平的改变
but at the level of the whole.
最后要修的一门课是总结性课程
The final course the students take then is the Capstone project,
开课时间是夏季
which happens over the summer.
这是一个独立课程
This is an independent project
允许学生结合
where students are able to integrate
课堂所学
what they've learned in their classes
进一步
and take a step forward in the directions
应用于他们各自的职业
that they want to go in their own professional application of this.
我们让学生进行研究
So we had students do research,
量化研究和质化研究
quantitative research or qualitative research;
我们让学生
we had students do literature reviews
就感兴趣的领域写文献观后感
in a particular area of interest;
他们计划写的书的进展计划
work proposals for book they want to write;
或实验计划等等
or workshop proposals and those kinds of things.
以上只是课程简介
So that's a brief overview of the courses.
Debbie会占用几分钟时间
Debbie is going to just take a couple of minutes
给大家看一些照片
to show you some pictures--
过去几分钟展示了太多文字
this has been a lot of texts in the last few minutes.
Debbie会展示一些照片 更详细地介绍一下学生
Debbie will show you some pictures and tell you more about the class.
交给Debbie
Debbie.
谢谢
Thanks.
大家听过了James的课程简介
Thank you. You heard about the course from James.
我会介绍一下课程安排
I'm going to tell you a little bit about how they are set up
和内容
and what they are.
这是一张开学周的照片
And this is a picture from emersion week--
开学周时 同学初次见面
emersion week is when the very first time students meet together
他们来宾州五天
that for 5 days to Penn.
我们的课程从早上八点到下午五点
And we have class from 8 to 5.
我知道听上去很疯狂
And I know it sounds kind of crazy
但我们相处得很快乐 你们看得出
but we have a lot of fun as you can tell.
学生们兴趣浓厚
And they stay engaged,
因为我们收录来自全球
because we bring faculties
各行各业的学生 在这个世界级学院
from all over the place and this world-class faculty--
他们有机会进行真正的交流
they really have a chance to interact with these.
班上有41个学生
The class is 41 students--
一起上课
they take all the courses together
更像是论坛而非讲座
and it's more a seminar than a lecture.
同学们有深入交流
So they really get to interact quite a bit.
休息时 午餐时
And during break, during lunchtime,
他们结识
etc, they get to see these people
来自世界各地的同学
that just have come in from various places.
宾州应用心理学硕士课程的
Another more of interaction
另一种交流形式是团体交流
that you get in the MAPP program is with cohorts.
每个人
Everyone is put in a cohort--
和另外三五个人组织一个团队
about 3 to 5 people.
你和他们合作不同的课题
And you'll do different projects with these people;
远程学习可以做很多事
you'll do a lot of things in distant learning;
可以经常和这些人交流
you'll communicate a lot with these people.
这是你获得的另一种深度
And this is just another depth that you get
当你与来自
when you get to work with people
世界各地的人合作时
from all different places and all different demographics.
我们很想利用总结性课程
And one of the things we really try to use the Capstone project for
作为踏脚石 让学生
is a stepping stone into what you are going to do
更顺利地展开应用
with your application.
很多人借助它
And many people have taken this
创建工作室
and they have created workshop for what they are doing.
有一位学生把积极心理学初级课本
One person actually took the primer in positive psychology
翻译成日语
and she translated it into Japanese.
她的译作得以出版
And she's getting it published.
那个计划让她获益良多
And that is quite a project for her.
还有学生
And other people have published
在学术刊物上发表了总结性课程论文
in scholarly journals their Capstone work.
被邀请进行讲座 这是一位学生
And people give presentations and this is a photo of someone
在积极心理学峰会上作讲座的照片
giving a presentation in a positive psychology summit.
我们录取学生进修硕士课程
So there are a lot of different things
他们可以做各种各样的事
that students do as we bring them to the program,
我们给他们打下坚实基础
as we give them a solid foundation
帮助他们加以应用
and then we help them start applying this move towards that.
申请者打来电话时
But one of the biggest questions we get
询问得最多的问题是
when we have applicants call in is,
"这个学位有什么用?"
"what can I do with a MAPP degree?"
我会告诉大家 这张快照上
I am going to tell you just as a quick snapshot:
Sasha Lewis Heinz 照片中的第一个人
Sasha Lewis Heinz, just the first person there--
目前她正攻读博士课程
she is now in the PHD program
在哥伦比亚大学进修发展心理学
in Development Psychology at Columbia University.
读博前 她攻读了宾州应用心理学硕士课程
So she came to the MAPP program before getting her PHD.
打下坚实的基础
So she has that foundation
那是她想应用和致力研究的
and that's what she wants to use and focus on
当她继续攻读博士时
as she goes through and gets her PHD.
上面第二名学生是Saniel Mimen
The second person up there is Saniel Mimen
她在投资公司工作并利用业余时间
who has worked with hedge funds but she found in her spare time--
她挤出时间
she found some time
创建了积极心理学每日新闻网站
to create a positive psychology news daily website,
内容囊括宾州硕士同学会撰写的
which is articles about research
有关积极心理学的研究和应用文章
and application of positive psychology written by MAPP alumni
他们真的在进行研究和应用
who are out there actually doing that.
另外 她还和
And another thing she's been able to do
其他多名硕士同学合力
along with a lot of other MAPP alumni
参与到培训中来 参与我们
is being involved in trainings and being involved in projects
积极心理学中心的项目
that have come through the positive psychology center.
中心有各种项目 去英国培训他人
As we get different projects to train people in the UK,
向学校推广积极心理学
to positive psychology in their schools,
我们派去参与项目的是硕士生
the people that we draw on are MAPP alumni,
因为他们有所需的教育背景和基础
because they have the education and foundation
去完成这些项目
that is needed to be able to put through these projects.
我们希望继续
So we hope to continue
安排同学参与
to put together alumni with various opportunities
各种机会
that come along to us.
Caroline Miller 照片中的第三个人
Caroline Miller, the third person there--
她是一位作家
she is an author
正准备出版她的第二本书
and she is getting ready to publish her second book
她也是一个演说家和教练
and she's also a speaker and a coach.
攻读硕士学位后
And she's had the opportunities
她获得很多授课的机会
since MAPP to actually teach a lot of the courses
她的方向是目标设立
and she's very focused on goal setting
和运动心理学
and she's very focused on sports psychology.
硕士课程大大扩展了她的能力
So this has really expanded what she's been able to do.
并非所有学生都是哈佛毕业生
And not all of our students are Harvard graduates,
但这三位都是哈佛毕业生
but these three happened to be them. Harvard graduates.
这张快照颇有趣味
So it's very interesting to see that little snapshot.
我们希望有更多哈佛毕业生参加我们的课程
And we hope we have many more Harvard graduates coming to our program.
James 你来总结吧?
So James, you wanna finish up here?
非常感谢 Debbie
Thank you very much, Debbie.
我们的推广名为"从教室走向世界"
Our presentation is entitled "From the Classroom to the World".
宾州应用心理学硕士课程显然是一个途径
And certainly the MAPP program is one way
将积极心理学带向世界
of taking positive psychology from the classroom to the world.
再简单介绍另一个机会
Just want to mention very briefly another opportunity:
我们刚刚创办国际积极心理学协会
We've just started the international positive psychology association.
它将成为一个重要国际组织
And this is going to be a major international organization
帮助积极心理学的研究人员和应用者
to help facilitate communication and collaboration among researchers
更便利的交流与合作
and practitioners of positive psychology.
这是照片

So we hope to see a lot of you at the MAPP program sooner or later.
同时
In the meantime,
祝你们本学期取得成功
wish you have a very successful semester
深入学习积极心理学的科学
as you dig into the science of positive psychology
并将之应用于生活
and put it into practice in your own lives,
思考如何把积极心理学
and think about how to take positive psychology
从教室带向世界
from the classroom to the world.
好的
OK.
成为宾州应用心理学硕士班的一员是种特权
It's such a privilege to be a part of MAPP
因为在那里共度一年的
because what you have there in a year
是来自各个领域的杰出人物
is all the top people from the field.
我们将会谈到的很多人
So many of the people we'll talk about,
比如Bob Fredrickson 过一会我们会谈到他
whether it's Bob Fredrickson who we'll talk about in a few minutes,
或者以后会谈到的David Cooper
whether it's David Cooper we'll talk about,
当然还有Martin Seligman
whether it's Martin Seligman of course,
都会去那里给大家讲座
will come there and present to you
你将和他们亲密相处
and you'll be spending quality time in small groups with them.
真是一种特权
Real privilege.
今天我想结束有关基础前提的讨论
So what I want to do today is finish up on the basic premises,
讨论最后一个前提
on the final premise.
还要再看这个吗 不
Now we are going to watch it again. No?
这个也不用看了
Or that?
可以了
Here we go.
最后也是第五个前提很重要
The final and the fifth premise is an important one;
是一个哲学前提
is a philosophical one
但我想在课程开始时介绍
but one I want to introduce at the beginning of the course
你们好理解我讲课的起源
so that you understand where I am coming from,
这门课程的来源
where this course is coming from--
因为很多人说
because many people say,
好的 快乐是重要的
"Ok, so happiness is important.
我们寻找它 我们有宣言
We seek it; we have declarations--
国家宣言
national declarations,
关于快乐对我们多么重要的个人宣言
individual declarations of how important it is for us.
但那不代表它是重要的 问题在于这个"是"
But that doesn't mean that it is important or the "is",
它是重要的但不代表我们应该去做
the fact that it is important doesn't mean we ought to do it.
我认为它不仅重要
My argument here is that not only is it important,
而且也应该是重要
it also ought to be important.
首先要阐述这个"是"
So first about the "is".
快乐 不论我们喜欢与否
Happiness, whether we like it or not,
不论它是有意识地
whether it's consciously ,
还是潜意识地 不论它是明显的还是隐晦的
subconsciously, whether it's explicit or implicit,
对多数人来说
for most people--
不是全部但对多数人来说
not all, but for most people,
快乐是最高追求
it is the highest end.
我们有宪法保证我们追求快乐
And again, we have Constitution save God in our pursuit of happiness.
我们投入大量努力
We spend a lot of effort,
大量时间思考自己和他人的快乐
a lot of time thinking about it for ourselves as well as for others.
二千多年前的亚里斯多德
Aristotle, over 2000 years ago,
"快乐是人生的意义和目的
"Happiness is the meaning and purpose of life,
人类存在的最终目标"
the whole aim and end of human existence."
William James
William James
1890年在"宗教经验之种种"中写道
in 1890 or in "The Variety of Religious Experiences" writes, "
如果要问
If we were to ask the question:
496
人类生命最主要的担心是什么?
"What is human life's chief concern?"
我们应该得到的一个答案是
one of the answers we should receive would be:
"是快乐"
"It is happiness."
如何获得 如何保持
How to gain, how to keep,
如何重获快乐
how to recover happiness,
是多数人时刻怀有的秘密动机
is in fact for most men at all times the secret motive of all they do,
是他们愿意忍受一切的目的
and all they are willing to endure."
你们可能听说过William James
Now you may have heard of William James--
这里有幢大楼以他命名
his name is after the building here.
他在二百多年前谈到快乐
And he talked about this over 200 years ago;
亚里斯多德在二千多年前也谈过
Aristotle over 2000 years ago.
而且不只是西方人
And it's not just peculiar to the West.
达赖喇嘛 "不论一个人是否相信宗教
The Dalai Lama, "Whether one believes in a religion or not,
不论一个人相信这种还是那种宗教
whether one believes in this religion or that religion,
我们生命的最终目标是快乐
the very purpose of our life is happiness.
我们生命的主要活动是寻找快乐"
The very motion of our life is towards happiness."
快乐是重要的
So it is important for people.
不论是有意识的
Again, whether it's conscious,
还是潜意识的 明显的还是隐晦的
subconscious, explicit or implicit,
问题是它确实重要
the question though is in fact it is important,
但快乐应该是重要的吗？
should it be important?
快乐的道德维度呢？
What about the moral dimension of happiness?
还有很多事情在发生
There are so many other things happening,
世上有很多重要的事情要做
so many important things to do in the world.
为什么把快乐作为最终目标
Why should we have happiness as our highest end,
作为主要担心
as our chief concern,
为什么由它来决定生命活动？
as that which determines the motion of our life?
换言之 幸福有什么好处？
In other words, what's good about wellbeing?
积极情绪有什么好处？
What's good about positive emotions?
大量研究都尝试回答这个问题
And there is a lot of research to answer this question.
暂不说研究
But before the research,
感觉好就是感觉好
it feels good to feel good.
想到快乐 注入内心
Think about it. Internalize it.
这是亚里斯多德的"同一律"
This is Aristotle's Law of Identity:
一即一 感觉好就是感觉好
A is A-- it feels good to feel good.
这本身就是辩解理由
And that, in and of itself is justification:
如果能感觉好 为什么不感觉好呢?
why not feel good, if we can feel good?
证明
So the burden to prove
快乐为什么是不重要的重担可能落在
why happiness is not important may be on the people
执否定观点的人身上
who would argue otherwise--
我们会在以后谈到这个论点
we will talk about that argument later.
但首先的关键问题是快乐本身是好的
But the first key issue is that it's good in and of itself--
几乎无需辩解
almost needs no justification.
然而除了感觉好
However, beyond just feeling good,
快乐还对我们的人生有帮助
happiness also contributes to our life,
对人际关系有帮助
to our relationships.
对他人有帮助
It contributes to other people.
Barbara Fredrickson做了这项研究
This is research done by Barbara Fredrickson,
在宾州大学任教的学会成员
one of the faculty members who teaches at U PENN.
你们曾在上面见过她的照片
You saw a picture of her up there.
Barbara Fredrickson的观点是
What Barbara Fredrickson says is that
积极情绪有一个进化理由
positive emotions have an evolutionary reason,
它们的目的不仅仅是让人感觉好
that they have a purpose beyond just making us feel good.
比如它们有助我们超越
For example, they help us think beyond
现在的思考范畴 拓展我们的思想
what we are thinking right now, broaden our thinking;
有助我们建立人际关系
they help us build relationships;
帮助我们建立能力
they help us build capacities--
这门课的一个主要概念
remember one of the key concepts of this course
就是积极情绪
is the positive emotions,
积极心理学
positive psychology as a field as a whole,
就是要建立能力
is about building capacities.
我们使用的两个类比
The two analogies we use
是加强我们的免役系统或加强"心理引擎"
was strengthening our immune system or stronger "psychological engine"
获得更强大的忍受能力
that has the capacity to endure more
不只是从负到零
not just from the negative to zero,
还要从零到正
but also from the zero to the positive.
这是Barbara Fredrickson的观点
So this is Barbara Fredrickson.
我想进一步引用她的文章
Let me quote extensively from her article,
也是你们这周要阅读的
which I believe you are reading for this week,
"我们应该努力培育积极情绪
"We should work to cultivate positive emotions
在自己身上和周围人身上
in ourselves and in those around us,
不能只将它们作为终极状态
not just as end states in themselves,
还要将其作为手段实现心理成长
but also as a means to achieving psychological growth
改善心理和身体的健康
and improved psychological and physical health over time.
我称其为积极情绪的扩建理论
I call this the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions
因为积极情绪似乎能扩展人们的瞬间想法
because positive emotions appear to broaden people's momentary thought
和动作指令库并建立持久的个人资源
action repertoire and build the enduring personal resources.
通过体验积极情绪
Through experiences of positive emotions,
人们实现改变
people transform themselves,
变得更有创造力 更博学
becoming more creative, knowledgeable,
适应性更强 更易融入社会
resilient, socially integrated,
获得更健康的人格"
and healthy individuals."
体验积极情绪有诸多好处
Numerous benefits to just experiencing positive emotions.
是双赢的
It's a win-win.
它让人感觉好
It feels good.
对我们有好处 对整个社会也有好处
And it's good for us and it's good for society as a whole
一会我就会解释
as I'll argue momentarily.
她谈到的问题包括
So what she's talking about here, for example,
积极情绪有助我们克服消极情绪
is that positive emotions help us overcome negative emotions.
体验消极情绪时
What happens when we experience negative emotions
我们的意识
is that our consciousness,
我们的思维变得狭窄 收紧
our thinking narrows and constricts.
只专注于一件事 比如
We focus just on one thing, so for example.
那可能是件好事
And that can be a good thing--
一头狮子朝我冲过来
you know, a lion comes to and charges me,
我不想考虑宾州大学硕士申请的事
"I don't want to start thinking about my MAPP application.
不想考虑室友说了什么
I don't want to start thinking about what my roommates say.
我只想考虑这头狮子
I want to focus on the lion.
我的意识变得狭窄 收紧
So my consciousness narrows and constricts,
进入"对抗或逃跑"模式
and I'm in the "fight or flight" mode.
有狮子朝我冲来时是件好事
Now that's a good thing when a lion charges me.
但它变得不是很好
But it's not a very good thing
如果我的意识继续狭窄
if my consciousness continues to narrow
收紧超出威胁 超出困难
and constrict beyond the threat, or beyond the hardship.
我们知道经常会进入下行螺旋
And what we know is that very often we enter a downward spiral,
一个恶性循环 当我们进入狭窄收紧的模式
a vicious cycle when we go into this narrow and constrict mode.
随便举个例子
So for example, just for example-- a random example:
女朋友离开了我
My girlfriend leaves me, alright?
我的思维收窄缩紧
And I narrow and constrict in terms of my thinking--
一心只想着被女友甩了
all I am thinking about is just that.
结果就是
And what will happen is as a result,
我感觉悲伤
I experience sadness,
因为我一心只想那个 悲伤
because that is what I am thinking about, and sadness--
是一种痛苦的情绪 一种消极情绪
a painful emotion, not a positive emotion--
导致进一步的收窄缩紧
leads to further narrow and constrict.
那有可能
And that can potentially,
并非总是 但可能一直持续下去
not always, but potentially can go on and on and on.
直到变成抑郁
And that's when it can become depression.
那时我将很难脱离这种下行
That's when I have difficulty getting out of this downward,
恶性的循环
vicious cycle.
积极情绪正相反
Positive emotions do the opposite.
它们扩展建立
They broaden and build.
扩建导致积极情绪
Broaden and build leads to positive emotions.
积极情绪再进一步扩建
Then positive emotions further broaden and build.
所以是个良性循环
So that's a virtuous cycle.
我眼界宽了
And I look broadly,
关注其他人
I look to othe people,
关注其他事 思考现在我能做什么?
I look to other things: So what can I do now?
我能去哪里?我把时间用在哪里?
Where can I go? Where can I spend my time?
很经常的是
And very often what that does--
积极情绪把我们带出下行螺旋
a positive emotion can take us out of this downward spiral
形成一个上行螺旋
and create an upward spiral.
积极情绪可以是看一部滑稽电影
A positive emotion can come in form of watching a humorous film;
可以是"一次深呼吸"
it can come in form of "if you take a deep breath"--
探讨"心理 身体"时会谈到深呼吸
we talked about deep breathing when we talked about my body;
积极情绪可以是与朋友交流
a positive emotion can come in form of interaction with a friend,
一次愉快的交流
a pleasant one.
积极情绪
It's the positive emotion
能把我们带离这个下行螺旋进入这个上行螺旋
that can take us out from this downward spiral to this upward spiral.
而且不用很久
And again it doesn't always take a very long time.
00:31:04,090 --&gt; 00:31:06,710
困难在于将之与准许为人相结合
And the challenge is to combine "the permission to be human"
去体会情绪 实现转移
to experience the emotion to go through the motion
但不会进入下行螺旋
and yet not to enter the downward spiral where six months later,
在发生小小意外六个月后 仍心情低落
after small incident, I'm still in that rot.
我们会谈到什么是合适的时候
We'll talk about what is the right time
如何找到合适的时候
and how do you find the right time,
以及如何在
how do you find the balance
思考痛苦情绪
between thinking about painful emotions
和让痛苦情绪滑入沉思到平衡
and when does it slide to rumination,
沉思并非总有帮助
which is not always helpful.
它有助克服消极情绪
So it helps overcome the negative emotions.
还有创造力 我们的眼界更宽
Also, creativity-- we think broadly--
能产生更多联系
we are able to make connections,
看到以前没有看到的联系
see connections we haven't seen before, perhaps.
有很多关于"抑郁创造者"的说法
There's a lot of the talk about the depressive creature.
如果你想拥有更高水平的创造力
If you want to have high level of creativity,
必须承受抑郁
it's a must you have to be depressed.
其实并非如此
Well, it turns out that's not the case.
躁狂抑郁病人一般更有创造力
Very often manic depressives are highly creative,
但一般在躁狂阶段
but that's usually during their manic phases.
在抑郁阶段 我们的思维收窄
In the depressed phase, our thinking is narrow;
我们失去创造力
we don't think outside the box usually--
当然有例外 但总体而言没有
of course there's many exceptions, but as a whole.
实际上有这样一项研究
In fact there's research--
在内科医生 医生中间进行
for example, this was done with internists, doctors,
向他们提出一个
who are giving a very difficult,
与肝脏问题有关的很困难的问题
very difficult question connected to a liver problem
那是一个病人的病症
that an individual patient had.
医生们被随机分成三组
And they divided them randomly into three groups--
第一组是对照组
the first group was a control group--
他们必须解决这个问题
they just had to solve the problem;
第二组听一段有关
the second group was given a statement
医学人文观的声明
about humanistic value of medicine--
为什么作医生如此重要
why is it so important to be a medical doctor;
第三组得到糖果
and the third group was given candy
让他们获得愉快放松的好心情
and put in a funny playful good mood.
第三组得到糖果
The third group that was given the candies
并获得积极愉快的心情
and put in a positive playful mood
明显比另外两组有更好表现
outperformed the other two groups significantly--
他们考虑更多选择
they thought about more options
得出更好的问题解决办法
and they actually came up with better solutions with that problem.
这是这个领域中的一项研究
And this is one of many studies in this area.
再举个例子 小孩子
Another example-- children.
一群小孩组成对照组
One group of children was a control group;
有人教第二组小孩回想
the second group was taught to think back
让他们大笑或微笑的经历
to experience that make them laugh or smile.
第二组
And that group did much better
在学习任务上比对照组表现更好
on the learning task than the control group,
因为他们被置于积极情绪
because they were put into a positive mood.
它是双赢的
Again, it's a win-win.
它在很多方面定义了"没有痛苦就没有回报"
It's defined in many ways that "no pain, no gain" paradigm,
不论是对医生的教育还是在学校
whether it's education of doctors or in school,
在一般的工作场所也一样
as well as generally in the workplace.
因为动力和精力
Because you see, also motivation and energy--
不需要研究就能明白
you don't need research for that,
你知道感觉好时
you know that when you are feeling good,
动力和精力更充沛
you have more motivation, you have more energy--
当然有很多研究支持这一点
of course, there is a lot of research to back that up.
最终达到成功
And ultimately success.
他们调查专业人士
They look in the professional people
能更好地控制自己的情绪
who are able to manage their emotions
获得积极情绪
better and lead to positive emotions,
脱离狭窄收紧进入扩建的人
get out of this narrow and constrict to the broaden and build
长远会取得更大成功
are in the long term more successful.
他们不是没有痛苦情绪
Again, it's not that people who don't have painful emotions--
没有的都是死人
remember? They are all dead.
那些人经历痛苦情绪
It's that people who experience painful emotions
但同时能够更好地
but are all in the same time able to shift themselves,
把自己 他们的意识 思想
their consciousness, their thinking,
他们的感受向积极方向转移
their experience to the positive more readily.
越快乐的人越成功
And happier people are more successful,
因为他们有更多精力 工作更努力
because they have more energy and work harder.
因为他们在追求
It's because their pursuing something
而不是在逃离
rather than running away from something--
这叫"靠近而非逃避目标"
it is called "approach rather than avoidance goals"--
我们将在探讨"目标"时谈到
we'll talk about that during the week on goals.
还因为他们建立更好的人际关系
Also because they form better relationships.
他们更开放更宽容
They are more open and generous.
他们的创造力更强
And they are more creative.
所有这些因素最终导致更高层次的成功
All these components ultimately lead to higher levels of success.
积极情绪不仅有助成功
Positive emotions not only contribute to our success,
不仅能让我们感觉好
they don't just contribute to our feeling good,
还有助我们获得幸福
they also contribute to our wellbeing.
乐观的人
Optimistic people, and again,
不是指盲目的乐天派
not Pollyannaish detached optimism,
而是脚踏实地的乐观主义者
but grounded optimists,
平均而言 明显更加长寿
on average, live significantly longer.
保佑你们
Bless you.
免疫系统更强
The immune system is stronger,
所以对身体健康也有帮助
so it also helps in terms of physical health.
现在的问题是 道德问题
But now the question is the moral question:
那么其他人呢?
What about other people?
我谈论经营自己的生活
How can I talk about or act in my life,
追求自己的快乐 这怎么不是自私?
pursuing my happiness isn't that selfish?
答案是"是的 那是自私"
Ant the answer is: "Yes, it is selfish."
当我对自己说
When I talk to myself, when I say to myself,
"我想更快乐"
"I want to be happier",
我对自己说"我想更快乐"
I say to myself, "I want to be happier."
那是一件自私的事
That' s a selfish thing.
它是坏的吗?是不道德的吗?
So it that bad? Is that immoral?
在我们的文化中
Well, in our culture,
自私和不道德成了同义词
selfishness and immorality have essentially become synonymous.
那是个问题
And that's a problem.
这就是为什么 因为这是头号
And here's why. Because this is the No. 1--
将自私等同于不道德是头号原因
equating to selfishness and immorality is the No. 1 cause--
多数是在潜意识里
subconsciously mostly, but not only--
导致不快乐的头号原因
No. 1 cause of unhappiness.
人们为追求自己的快乐感到内疚
Because people feel guilty about pursuing their own happiness.
人们在自我感觉很好时会内疚
People feel guilty at times feeling good about themselves.
我怎么可以? 我怎么敢自我感觉良好?
How can I? How dare I feel good about myself?
我怎么能追求自己的快乐
How can I pursue my happiness
当世上有那么多痛苦时?
when there is so much suffering in the world?
世上确有很多痛苦
And there is a lot of suffering in the world.
我们要如何回应?
So how do we respond to that?
首先 快乐是正和博弈
First of all, happiness is a positive sum game--
不是零和博弈
it's not a zero sum game.
也不是负和博弈
Neither it is a negative sum game--
我的快乐不是从别人那里夺来
it's not that my happiness takes away from other people's happiness
那将是负和博弈
which will be a negative sum game:
我有更多 你一定更少
if I have more, you'll necessarily have less.
甚至不是一个零…
It's not even a zero--
或者我更少
or rather if I have less,
你也会更少 那也是负和博弈
you'll have less- that's a negative sum game--
或零和博弈 我更多 你就会更少
or a zero sum game-- if I have more, you'll have less-
饼就那么大
it's a fixed pie.
不是这样的
It's not that.
它是一个正和博弈
It's a positive sum game.
为什么?因为快乐是感染的
Why? Because happiness is contagious.
如果我更快乐 我更有可能
If I'm happier, I'm more likely
对他人的快乐和幸福作出贡献
to contribute to other people's happiness and wellbeing.
感受快乐 换言之
Being happy, in other words,
也是一种道德状态
is also a moral state in the sense of actually contributing
对他人的幸福作出贡献
to other people's wellbeing.
佛在几千年前就谈到它
The Buddha talked about it thousands of years ago,
"一支蜡烛可以点燃千支蜡烛
"Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle,
蜡烛的生命不会被缩短
and the life of the candle will not be shortened.
分享绝不会减少快乐"
Happiness never decreases by being shared."
就像传递光明
It's like passing on light.
你快乐并努力争取快乐
If you are happy, and work on your happiness,
就是间直接对他人的快乐作出贡献
you are contributing indirectly to other people's happiness,
就像上次大笑的婴儿 把你们逗笑
just like the baby who laughed last time-- made you laugh.
笑是感染的
It's contagious.
一般来说 努力争取快乐的人
Generally people who work on their happiness--
再一次 不是那些总是保持快乐的人
again, not people who experience constantly high,
那种人将很难建立人际关系
they would have difficulty having real relationships
因为他们是死的
since they are dead--
一般来说 活着的人
but generally, people, those of us who are alive,
努力争取快乐
who work on happiness,
体验生活的变迁 起起落落
who experience the vicissitude of life-- the ups and downs--
但努力争取快乐而且越来越快乐
but overall work on happiness and become happier and happier,
有更好的人际关系
have better relationships,
更宽容 更接受他人
more generous, more accepting of other people,
更容忍他人和他们自己
more tolerant of other people as well as themselves.
很多研究表明自我帮助
There's a lot of research to show that helping ourselves,
换言之 努力为自己争取快乐
in other words, working on our happiness,
有助我们获得幸福
contributing to our wellbeing,
也能引导我们对他人更加宽容和亲切
leads us to also be more generous and benevolent toward others.
一位重要的研究者
This is a research by one of the leading researchers,
积极情绪领域的首批研究者之一
one of the first researches in the area of positive emotions,
Alice Isen进行了这个研究
Alice Isen.
她反复证明
And she showed, time and again,
感觉好如何对我们和他人都有益
how feeling good is good for us and good for others,
反之亦然
and it works the other way as well.
这是快乐很美妙的地方
This is a wonderful thing about happiness.
别人快乐你也快乐
It works the other way as well,
因为帮助他人也是帮助自己
because helping others also helps ourselves.
记得你们这周的任务
Remember your task for this week--
一些同学已经知道
a dozen of you have already read it--
就是去做超越以往所做的事情
it's to commit- above and beyond what you usually commit-
一天内多做五件好事
five extra acts of kindness during one day.
多做五件好事
Five extra acts of kindness.
这是Sonja Lyubomirsky做过的一项研究
This is a research done by Sonja Lyubomirsky--
我在第一堂课提及她的书
I mentioned her book in the first class:
《快乐之道》
"The how of happiness".
她很好地
She's done fantastic work,
证明人们
showing how people who help--
不论是在一周内多做五件好事
whether it's helping five extra acts during the week--
可以更多
it can be more;
不必局限于五件
doesn't have to be restricted to five--
或者人们在一天内多做五件好事
or people who help five extra acts during one day,
都能让他们更幸福
it's actually contributing to their wellbeing.
帮助他人也是帮助自己
So helping others is also helping ourselves.
我说到的一件事 只说了一半意思
You know, one of the things that I say and only half ingest,
即最自私的所为就是善举
is that I know of no more selfish act and a benevolent act.
只说了一半意思
Again, only half ingest--
因为两者有内在联系
because the two are interconnected.
两者间有自我实施的循环
And there is a self-enforcing loop between the two,
帮助他人就是帮助自己
where helping others helps ourselves;
帮助自己继而帮助他人
and helping ourselves, in turn, helps others.
不要把它看作自私
And rather than looking it as selfish--
有人可能会这样简单考虑
some people may feel this ease way--
不该把自私等同于不道德
and rather than looking it as selfish i.e. -- equal immoral.
我们应该把它视为
We should look at it as something
人性的美妙之处
that is so wonderful about our nature,
是我们应该颂扬的本性
a part of our nature that we should celebrate.
我们的快乐与他人的相关连
The fact that our happiness is tied to others,
我们通过同情网络和他人相关连
the fact that we are tied to others in a web of empathy--
那是人性的美妙之处
that's a wonderful thing about human nature.
一样值得我们进一步颂扬的东西
A thing that we need to celebrate much more than we are doing already.
如果不颂场
Because remember, if we don't celebrate,
如果我们不欣赏人性的那一部分
if we don't appreciate that part of our nature,
人性的那一部分将贬值
that part of our nature will depreciate.
欣赏有两个意思
To appreciate has two meanings as we talked about:
一是懂得感谢 二是传递
one is to say "thank you" for something and two is to grow.
如果我们欣赏人性中
If we appreciate the good in our nature,
欲望中好的东西
in our inclinations,
如果我们欣赏本性中那一部分
if we appreciate that part of our nature,
它将升值 我们将获得更多
it will appreciate and we'll have more of it.
如果我鄙视它并说
If we look down at it and say,
"很可怕
"It's a terrible thing that
我从帮助他人身上获得利益"
I just derive benefits from helping other people",
那么本性中那一部分将随时间贬值
then that part of our nature will depreciate over time.
你们正在读我书中的冥想部分
For your readings, you are reading one of the meditations in my book,
书中有更详细的阐述
where I talk about it a little bit more in length,
也给出了哲学基础
and I also gave the philosophical foundation,
因为在很多方面有别于"数数和思考"
because in many ways this goes against "counting and thinking"
那种方法在20和21世纪处于统治地位
that has been so dominant in our 20th and 21st century
思考道德
thinking about morality.
感谢好就是感觉好
It feels good to feel good.
也能让他人感觉好
It also contributes to others to feel good.
我想以介绍一位
I want to end this premise idea
一生致力于
by talking a little bit about a person for whom,
传播快乐的人来结论这个前提
one of the chief purpose in life was to spread happiness--
圣雄甘地 这是关于他的一个故事
Mahatma Gandhi. This is a story about him.
一个女人像很多人一样
There was a woman like many people came
来寻求甘地的建议
to ask for advice from Gandhi.
她长途赶来
And she came from very far away.
还带着儿子
And she brought her son along.
她拜见甘地
And she said in front-- she got audience with Mahatma,
在他面前说 她对他说
and she said in front of him, and she said to him
"我长途赶来 因为我儿子有个问题
"I came from afar, because I have a problem with my son.
我儿子吃太多糖
My son eats way too much sugar.
希望你能告诉他别吃太多糖
And I'd like you to tell him to stop it.
因为糖损害他的健康 牙齿
Because it's hurting his health, his teeth.
他会听你的 他很崇拜你"
And he will listen to you. He admires you.
甘地看着她说
" Gandhi looked at her and said,
"夫人 你能一个月后再来吗?"
"Madam, can you please come back in a month?"
她不明白为什么但还是听了他的话
She didn't know why but she listened to him after all--
因为他是甘地
he was Gandhi.
她离开 长途返回
She left, went far away,
一个月后又回来
came all the way back a month later,
再次与甘地见面
and once again, got an audience with Gandhi.
她在他面前说
She said in front of him,
她说"一个月前我来过"
She said "I was here a month ago."
他说"是的 我记得"
And he said, "Yes. I remember."
她说"你能告诉我儿子
And she said, "Could you please tell my son
不要吃太多糖吗?"
to stop eating so much sugar?"
于是甘地注视着那个孩子说
So Gandhi looks at the child intensely and says,
"孩子 不要再吃太多糖"
"Son, stop eating too much sugar."
就是这样
And that's it.
那个女人很困惑 她鼓起勇气
The woman is obviously perplexed and musters up her courage,
说"圣雄 非常感谢
and says, "Mahatma, thank you very much.
我肯定他不会再吃太多糖
I'm sure he will stop eating too much sugar,
但为什么不在一个月前告诉他
but why couldn't you tell him this a month ago,
在我长途赶来的时候?"
when I came all the way here?"
他说"夫人 因为一个月前
And he said, "Well, madam, because a month ago,
我也吃太多糖"
I was eating too much sugar."
是的 我知道这是个很深奥的笑话
Yeah, I know, it's a very sophisticated joke--
需要时间 很高兴你们消化了
it takes a while, but I'm glad you got it.
甘地说过一件事
One of the things Gandhi said,
出自他的精彩自传
that he talked about is from his wonderful autobiography,
《我的对于真理的实践经历》
"My experiment with truth"--
"成为你想在世上见到的改变"
"Be the change you want to see in the world."
只有这样才能实现改变
This is how you bring about change.
我和想大家作个小练习
I want to do a quick exercise with you.
特别对男生来说是个困难练习
This is a tough exercise especially for guys,
但请忍耐
but please bear with me.
感觉不舒服的
So-- if you don't feel comfortable doing it,
就不要做 希望按下面的指示做
don't do it-- what I'd like to do now is as following:
让你的姆指和中指
Take your thumb and your middle finger
尽可能形成一个直角
and create as much as possible a 90 degree angle.
可能有点痛
May hurt a little bit,
尽可能形成一个直角
but try as much as possible to create a 90 degree angle.
看着我 就像这样
Ok, watch me: Just like this, Ok?
直角
90 degree angle.
再让这两个手指
Now take these two fingers--
中指和姆指
the middle finger and the thumb--
尽可能保持直角时围成一个圆圈
and as much as possible, from that 90 degree angle, create a circle.
男性比女性更难做到
Again, it's more difficult for men than for women--
男性的柔韧度更小
less flexible.
围成一个圆圈
Create a circle.
看上去像只兔子
So it looks like a rabbit.
如果能投影的话
If you have them on the show.
中指和姆指
Middle finger exactly and your thumb.
好 看着我
Alright, just watch me.
像这样 尽可能围成一个圆圈
Like this. As much as possible.
922
不是完美的圆但要尽力
It's not perfectly round, but as much as possible.
把这个围起来的圆圈
Now take that circle that you have just created--
看到吗? 这是个圆圈
Can you see? That's a circle.
把这个圆圈放在面颊上
Take that circle and put it on your cheek.
另一个地方
Your other cheek.
可能需要一会
Ok, this could also take a while.
我看到的多数同学都放在了下巴上
But most people from what I see, put it on their chin.
我很清楚地说是"面颊"
Now I said it very clearly, "cheek".
问题就在这里
But you see, here is the thing:
多数人都是照你做的做而不是照你说的做
People mostly do what you do, rather than what you say.
请记住这一点
So remember that,
我不认为课堂上有任何人
because I don't think there is anyone in this room
会告诉我
who would tell me now,
"我的人生目标是让别人不幸
"my goal in life, my objective is to make people miserable.
我真得想那么做
I really want to do that.
我想要世上所有人都不幸"
You know I want everyone to be miserable in the world."
这里不会有人真得说出那种话 希望如此
There is not one person here who would actually say that, I hope.
我们在座的多数人 不论做什么
So most of us here, whatever we do in our lives,
从现在到未来 都是理想主义者
now and in the future, are idealists.
我们想为世人造福
We want to do good in the world;
想传播快乐
we want to spread happiness.
但记住 人们照你做的做
But remember, people do what you do,
00:47:46,380 --&gt; 00:47:47,220
不是照你说得做
not what you say.
你也许想传播快乐 通过你的言话
So you may want to spread happiness, through your word.
但最好的方法
But ultimately, the best way,
传播快乐的最佳方法是努力争取自己的快乐
the optimal way spreading happiness is to work on your own happiness,
因为那时你就成为榜样
because then you are leading by example.
这也适用于领导
That applies to leadership.
领导最重要的不是说的话
The most important thing about leadership is not what you say;
而是如何以身作则
it's what you do.
为人父母最重要的
The most important thing about parenting--
不是告诉子女"诚实很重要"
it's not how much you tell your child "honesty is important"
而是你自身有多诚实
but rather how honest you are.
如果你想传播快乐
If you want to spread happiness,
"成为你想在世上见到的改变" 以身作则
"Be the change you want to see in the world." By example.
这就是五个基本前提
So these are the five basic premises that we talked about.
它们构成这门课的基础
They formed the foundation of the course.
我们将在未来两个月
And what we are going to do over the next couple of month
扩展这些前提
is expand on these--
最重要的是如何将研究
most importantly, see how we can take the research,
原则运用于生活
the rigor and apply it to our lives.
现在开始下一课
So let me move on now to the next lecture,
"信念即自我实现预言"
which is "Belief as Self-Fulfilling Prophecies".
我必须承认
This I must say,
这个话题点燃了我的想象
this topic ignited my imagination
当我是孩子时想到它
when I was a kid when I thought about it;
当我还是一名运动员时
when I was an athlete.
那时我明白了信念的力量
And that's when I understood the power of the mind.
后来它挑起我对心理学的兴趣
And that would pick my interests in psychology.
我想从一个特别的故事开始
I want to start with a story, a specific story,
在很多方面 它是我听到过的
that in many ways I can say it is the first story,
第一个有关心理学的故事
psychological story that I heard of.
那个故事让我明白
The story that I heard that brought home to me the message
心理学对幸福和成功是多么重要
how important psychology is to wellbeing and to success.
成功对14岁的壁球手来说
And success, as a fourteen years-old squash player,
是我生命中最重要的东西
was the most important thing in my life.
故事讲的是Roger Bannister
And the story is of Roger Bannister.
举下手
Just so I get a show of hands:
多少人听说过他?好的 只有少数
how many people have heard of Roger Bannister? Ok. A handful.
听过的可以重温一次
So those of you who have, can hear it again.
Roger Bannister是个跑手
Roger Bannister was a runner.
跑一英里
He ran the mile.
直到1954年 在四分钟以内跑完一英里
And until 1954, running the mile in under 4 minutes
被认为是不可能的
was considered impossible.
事实上医生证明四分钟跑一英里
In fact, doctors proved the 4 minutes for the mile
是人类能力的极限
was the limit of human ability.
生理学家进行实验
Physiologists ran tests,
在科学上展示证明人类能力极限
showing, proving scientifically the limit of human ability
是四分钟跑一英里
was running the mile in 4 minutes.
不可能少于四分钟
You could not go below that.
跑手们证明了医生和科学家…
And runners proved the doctors and scientists--
证明了他们是对的
proved that they were right
一英里跑四分钟两秒
and ran the mile in two seconds and 4 minutes,
四分钟一秒 但没有跑手能少于四分钟
one second, but no runner could run the mile in under 4 minutes,
从一英里跑计时以来
ever since the mile was actually timed--
当人们开始计时跑时
when they started to time runs.
那是不可能的 医生和科学家证明了
It was impossible-- doctors and scientists showed,
跑手 运动员
runners, athletes,
世上顶尖选手证明了医生们是对的
the top-ones in the world proved that the doctors were right.
然后Roger Bannister出现
And then came along Roger Bannister.
他说"四分钟内跑完是可能的
Roger Bannister said, "It is possible to run in 4 minutes.
我要做给你们看"
And in fact, I'm going to do it."
说这话时 他是牛津大学的医学博士
Now when he said it, he was a medical doctor at Oxford University.
也是一名出色的跑手
He was a good runner,
顶级跑手 但时间远高于四分钟
top runner, but nowhere near the 4 minutes mark.
他的最好时间是四分12秒
His best time was 4 minutes and 12 seconds.
自然没有人把他当真
And of course, no one took him seriously.
但Roger Bannister坚持苦练
But Roger Bannister continued to train and work hard,
不比别的跑手练得更苦
not harder than the rest of the runners,
但和世上别的跑手一样苦练
but as hard as the top runners in the world.
而且有进步
And he did get better.
他突破了四分十秒
In fact, he broke the 4 minutes and 10 seconds mark,
四分五秒
4 minutes and 5 seconds mark
跑到四分两秒时停止
and he got 4 minutes and 2 seconds and stopped,
像所有人一样
like everyone else--
无法低于四分二秒
could not go below the 4 minutes and 2 seconds.
他不是世上最好的跑手
So he wasn't even the best runner in the world,
但也是佼佼者
but among the best.
但他还是说"有可能
But he continued to say "it is possible;
在这件事上人类没有极限
there is no human limitation on that;
我们能在四分钟之内跑完一英里"
we can run the mile in under 4 minutes."
他坚持这么做 坚持练习 却一直失败
And he continued to say, continued to train for years.
直到1954年 1954年5月6日
Until 1954. On the 6th of May, 1954,
在重回故校时
on his home tour at Oxford University,
Roger Bannister用了3分59秒跑完一英里
Roger Bannister ran the mile in 3 minutes and 59 seconds.
轰动一时 登上全世界的头版头条
Sensation. Front page news all over the world.
"科学遭到挑战""医生遭到挑战"
"Science defied". "Doctors defied".
"不可能成为可能"
"The impossible made possible".
它成为梦想一英里
It became known as the dream mile.
现在听这个
Now listen to this.
数十年来 自从开始一英里跑计时以来
For decades, ever since the mile was timed,
没有人突破四分钟界限
no one broke the four minute barrier.
那被认为是不可能的
It was considered impossible.
但在5月6日 Roger Bannister特做到了
And on the 6th of May, Roger Bannister does it.
六周后 澳大利亚跑手John Landy
Six weeks later, John Landy, the Australian runner,
一英里跑了3分57.9秒
runs the mile in 3 minutes 57.9 seconds.
第二年 1955年
The following year, 1955,
37名跑手在四分钟内跑完一英里
37 runners ran the mile in under 4 minutes.
1956年 超过三百名跑手突破四分钟界限
1956, over 300 runners break the 4 minute barrier.
这是怎么回事?
Now what happened?
运动员们更加努力训练?
Was it that somebody started to train harder?
当然不是
Of course not.
是有了新的技术 新的鞋子?
Was it new technologies, new shoes?
不是 是信念
It wasn't. It was the mind.
信念是多么强大
Look how powerful the mind is.
不是因为跑到那个时间
It wasn't the fact that they were running that time
就说"不好 超过速度极限了
and they say "Oops! We are over the speed limit!
放慢速度吧"
Let's slow down a little bit."
根本不是那样 他们尽了最大努力
Not at all! They were trying their hardest,
1051
最大可能
their utmost.
然而他们的潜意识限制了他们
And yet, their subconscious mind limited them,
阻止他们突破界限
prevented them from breaking that barrier
那不是医生
that happened to be not a physical barrier as doctors,
生理学家和科学家们声称的身体界限
physiologists and scientists had claimed.
而是心理界限
It was a mental barrier.
Roger Bannister攻破了那个要塞
And what Roger Bannister did was break down the fort,
意志和心理上的要塞
the mental psychological fort.
信念即自我实现预言
Beliefs are self-fulfilling prophecies.
它们经常决定我们的表现
Very often they determine how we perform,
我们表现的多好或多糟
how well or how poorly we perform.
经常决定我们的人际关系有多好或不那么好
They often determine how good or not so good our relationships are.
它们是人生成功和幸福的头号预言
They are the No. 1 predictor of life success as well as wellbeing,
我们将会谈到
as we'll talk about.
今天和下节课我们要谈的是
So what we are going to talk about today and next time
信念如何形成现实
is how beliefs shape reality.
它如何发挥作用?
How it works?
信念力量背后的机制和科学是什么?
What is the mechanism, the science behind the power of the mind?
因为在很多方面 这听上去像神秘主义
Because in many ways, this sounds like mysticism.
一部分是很神秘 仍无法理解
And part of it is mystical-- still not understandable--
但我们会谈到我们所知的
but we are going to talk about as much as we know--
信念为什么会起作用及如何起作用
why it works and how it works.
可惜 人们对乐观主义有很多误解
There is unfortunately a lot of misunderstanding about optimism.
因为自助运动在很多方面
Because the self-help movement in many ways
是在告诉我们信念力量是怎么回事
is about telling us how it's all about the power of the mind,
提到《思考致富》那本书
talk about "Think and grow rich", the book;
我们会讨论各种秘密
we'll talk about the secrets
它们如何通过思想创造现实
which is about creating our reality through our thoughts.
其中有些是事实 但仅是部分
And there's some truth to these-- but only some truth.
我们将连通象牙塔和主街
We are going to bridge Ivory tower and Main Street,
说明那个信仰背后的科学和危险
and show the science and also the danger behind that belief.
1082
最重要的是如何应用?
Most importantly, how do we apply?
如何加强我们的信念
How do we enhance the belief in ourselves
如果真有这么紧密的关联
if there's such high correlation
如果希望
and there's a very high correlation
乐观主义和信念真的
and predictive power to a sense of hope,
有着非常紧密的关联和预测力
to a sense of optimism, to beliefs.
如果它们决定我们的产出
If they so much determine our outcome,
无论在体育场上
in the athletic field,
还是在工作地点 在人际关系上
in the workplace, in a relationship--
如果它如此重要 那么该如何加强信念？
if it matters so much, then how can we raise our beliefs?
我们会谈到Bandura对自我效能的研究
And we'll talk about work by Bandura on self-efficacy,
1093
谈到Nathaniel Branden对自尊的研究
or by Nathaniel Branden on self-esteem.
如何才能将梦想变成现实
How we can make a dream into reality--
可以是政治梦想
whether it's political dream--
我们将谈到马丁路德金的"梦想法"
we'll talk about Martin Luther King's dream approach-
他是如何做到 做了什么
how he did it and what he did;
也可以是个人梦想
or a personal dream,
我们会谈到Herbert Benson和Bandura
where we'll talk about the work of Herbert Benson as well as Bandura.
再一次引用佛的话
Once again, the Buddha,
"境随心转
"We are what we think.
全由意念升起
All that we are arises with our thoughts.
我们的念头造就了世界"
With our thoughts, we make our world."
这是几千年前的一个主张
Again, this was a claim made thousands of years ago.
现在我要做的
What I want to do now
是专注于这个主张的科学基础
is focus on the scientific foundation of this claim.
我会从皮格马利翁开始讲起
And I'll start by talking about Pygmalion in the classroom.
"Pygmalion"是古希腊语
The source of the word, Pygmalion is ancient Greece.
皮格马利翁是个雕刻家
Pygmalion was a sculptor.
成年后他开始寻找理想中的女人
And what he did was when he came of age looking for his ideal woman.
他想结婚
He wanted to get married.
他在雅典城里寻找
So he went and looked around Athens where he lived;
找遍整个希腊
he looked around the all of Greece;
找遍整个希腊帝国
he looked around the Greek Empire;
去希腊帝国以外寻找 寻找他理想中的女人
he looked beyond the Greek Empire, looking for his ideal woman--
一个能和他结婚的女人
a woman whom he could marry.
00:57:54,650 --&gt; 00:57:56,150
但没有找到
And he couldn't find her,
不论去哪里找
no matter where he looked.
这是可以理解的
I mean it's understandable--
那是1879年之前 雷德克利夫学院还没成立
this was before 1879 which was when Red Cliff was founded,
远在哈佛成为男女合校之前
and long before Harvard became co-ed.
他找不到理想中的女人 于是他返回雅典
So he couldn't find his ideal woman and he went back to Athens.
他对自己说
And he said to himself.
"我不再寻找理想中的女人
"Well, instead of finding that ideal woman,
我要雕刻一座雕像"因为他是雕刻家
I will create a sculpture"-- as he was a sculptor,
"我会以她的形象雕刻一座雕像"
"I will create a sculpture in her image."
他雕刻出那座雕像
And he created that sculpture.
当他看着她时
And when he looked at her,
他被激动之情和悲伤淹没
he was so overwhelmed with emotion and sadness
因为他找不到她
that he couldn't find her,
于是他开始哭泣
that he began to cry.
宙斯 雅典娜 特别是阿芙罗狄蒂
And then Zeus, Athena and especially Aphrodite,
俯视他 深感同情 于是把雕像变活
looking down on him, took mercy and brought the statue to life.
当然他们幸福地生活下去
And of course, they lived happily ever after.
这是这个词的由来
So this is the source of the word, Pygmalion.
然后萧伯纳借助这个词
Pygmalion was then taken by George Bernard Shaw,
创作了一部情节类似的戏剧
who created a play based on a similar idea
后来被改编成音乐剧《窈窕淑女》
which was made into a musical, "My Fair Lady".
说的是Higgins
The idea here is how Higgins,
一位博士 语言学家
doctor, linguist,
如何把一个卖花女塑造成贵族
took a flower girl and molded her in the sense into being royalty.
当然故事讲完时
What of course happened through the story
是她塑造了他 改变了他
was that she molded him more and transformed him.
非常精彩的故事 当时很重要的故事
Fascinating story and very important story at the time.
因为它挑战了整个阶级体系
Because it challenged the whole class system,
人生来就有阶级 不能
that people are born into a certain place and cannot--
也不应该被改变
and should not-- be moved.
在当时是很重要的戏剧 今天也是如此
So a very important play at that time, as well as today.
皮格马利翁和人是可以被改变
About Pygmalion and people can be changed,
被改造的
can be transformed.
1960年代
In the 1960s,
Robert Rosenthal曾在本系担任多年主任
Robert Rosenthal who was the head of our department for many years--
现在就职加州大学河滨分校
he's now in UC Riverside--
00:59:57,850 --&gt; 01:00:01,
把皮格马利翁的思想应用于课堂
took this idea of Pygmalion and applied it in the classroom.
他是这么做的 Rosenthal随便走进几间学校
Here is what he did. Rosenthal went into a group of random schools.
去到学生中间
And what he did there was went to the students,
让他们接受一次测验
had them take a test
然后去找他们的老师并告诉他们
and then go to their teachers after and tell the teachers,
"你们的学生刚接受了一个新测试
"Your students just took a new test that was devised--
一种新的学业测试 叫作快速迸发者测试"
a new academic test which is called "the fast spurters' test".
测试能让我们找出
What that means is that we identify students
将在新学年在学业上
who are going to take a big leap,
取得巨大进步的学生
intellectual leap forward in this coming year,
在新学年取得巨大进步
a spurt forward in this coming year.
换言之 他的意思是
In other words, what he was saying--
测试找出最有潜力的学生
it identifies students with highest potential.
他发现…
And what he found then was when he told these students--
他对这些老师说的是
the teachers-- what he told these teachers was that
"这只是仅供参考 不能向学生透露
"it is just not a FYI-- you cannot tell the students this.
我们不希望学校有歧视行为
We don't want any discrimination in your school,
只是让你们知道 这些学生有巨大潜力
but just so you know, these are your fast spurters.
这是一项新发明的测试
It's a new test, newly devised.
只有你们知道就好"老师们不知道的是
Just so you know." Unbeknownst to the teachers,
对学生进行的测试
the actual test which was given to those students
只是普通的现成的智商测试
was a regular off-the-shelf IQ test.
老师们也不知道这些所谓的
Also unbeknownst to the teachers was these students names,
"快速迸发者"或者潜力巨大的学生
who were deemed "the fast spurters"/"high potential students",
都是从一个帽子抓阄抓出来的
were literally randomly picked out from a hat.
他们都是普通学生
So there were regular students,
和别的学生没有区别
like all other students,
但老师们以为他们有巨大潜力
but the teachers thought they were "fast spurters".
Robert Rosenthal离开学校
Robert Rosenthal leaves the school,
学年结束时再回来
comes back in the end of the year.
他发现 他查看他们的英语成绩
And here's what he finds-- he looks at their English scores:
"快速迸发"学生有明显进步
the "fast spurters" improved significantly
比任何学生的进步都快
more than any of the other students.
他查看他们的数学成绩
He looked at their maths scores,
因为英语不够客观
because English is not really objective
也许是老师们
and you know maybe it was the teachers
觉得某些学生英语更好
who thought they were better than they were really.
于是他查看他们的数学 客观的成绩
So he looked at their maths, their objective scores.
这些学生也有明显进步
These students improved significantly
比其他任何学生的进步都大
more than any of the other students.
接下来才是有决定性的结果
But here is the clincher:
Robert Rosenthal又对所有学生
Robert Rosenthal administered once again an IQ test
进行了一次智商测试
for all the students.
他发现被标签为
And what he found was the students who were labeled--
被随机地标签为"快速迸发"的学生
randomly so, but who were labeled--
智商在一年间有很大增加
"fast spurters", their IQ increased significantly over the year
而且在长期研究中保持着增加
and maintained that increase in a longitudinal study.
这让人不解
Now this is my bog I mean:
智商
IQ is supposed to be in your intelligent quotient
本来是生而有之的
that you are born with!
它是恒定的
It's immutable.
1205
从出生到死亡时都不会改变
It doesn't change from the day you were born to the day you die--
或者说他们这样认为
or so they thought.
但它却因为
It changed significantly just based the belief
老师对学生的信念而改变
that the teacher had in her/his students.
信念即自我实现预言
Belief as self-fulfilling prophecies.
这项研究说明了什么？
What happened in the study?
老师们被骗了吗？
Was it that the teachers were fooled?
突然产生幻象? 不是的
And suddenly were made to see an illusion? No.
01:03:09,190 --&gt; 01:03:11,500
是因为他们之前被欺骗
It was that they were alluded before.
幻象是他们看不到
and the illusion was that they didn't see
就在他们眼前的东西
what is right in front of their very eyes,
即每个学生都有潜力
which is the potential inherent in every single student.
Robert Rosenthal来到 可以说是骗了他们
And then Robert Rosenthal comes and fools them in a sense,
01:03:27,420 --&gt; 01:03:30,410
"骗"他们注意到一直在眼前的东西
but "fools" them into seeing what has been there all along.
在那之前 他们没注意到车上的孩子
Before Rosenthal, they didn't see children on the bus.
可以这么说
So to speak.
之后 突然他们在一些孩子身上
After that, they suddenly in some children
看到一直都有的潜力
saw the potential that was there all along.
他们欣赏那种潜力 潜力得到升值
And they appreciated that potential and that potential appreciated.
他们灌溉 播撒阳光
They watered, they shed a light to it
种子开始发芽生长
and the seed germinated and grew.
这正是Marva Collins每天在学校里做的事
This is exactly what Marva Collins does day in and day out in school.
她看到存在的潜力
She seed the potential that is there;
她不是发明家
she's not even inventing something.
没有脱离现实
She's not detached from reality.
是人们看不到他人身上的潜力
It's rather the people who don't see the potential in other people
也看不到自己身上的潜力 我们会讨论到
as well as in themselves as we'll discuss.
他们没有看到整个现实
They are not seeing the full reality.
只看到一部分
They are only seeing part of it.
完全无视车上的孩子们
They are completely missing the children on the bus.
我们知道无视一部分现实是多么容易
And we know how easy it is to miss part of reality,
就算他们就在我们眼前
even they are right in front of our very eyes.
经常需要被问及
Or it often takes a question--
问及我们之前忽略了什么
it takes on the quest and we miss what we have seen before,
不论是对风险人口的研究
whether it was research with at-risk population,
或者是人口结构
whether it was the geometric shapes,
或者只是对我们的
whether it was asking only the negative questions
人际关系和自己提出负面问题
about our relationship or about ourselves,
或者没有看到
or whether it's not seeing the potential
每个孩子身上都有的潜力
that exist in just about all kids.
如果我们看到它
If only we see it.
只要我们看到它
And if we see it,
欣赏它 灌溉它
appreciate it, we water it,
播撒阳光
we shed a light to it,
它就会感恩 成长
and it appreciates, it grows.
Rosenthal做的只是将他们注意力
So what Rosenthal did was simply shift their attention to something
转移到一直在那里的东西上
that was there all along.
在工作场所也是如此
Same in the workplace.
几百几千次地重复着
Replicated hundreds, thousands of times--
皮格马利翁效应
the Pygmalion effect.
曾在一个工作场所里重演过
It was replicated in a workplace
主管或经理被告知 这些是
where leaders are told or managers are told "these are your top,
极有潜力的员工
highest potential employees".
那些员工也是随机挑出的
And these employees, again, randomly picked,
但真的变成最有潜力的员工
actually became the highest potential employees.
并取得更大成功
And they succeeded much more.
他们的保持力增加 工作表现出色
Retention went up for them; performance went up;
在公司更有可能被升职
they were more likely to advance in their organization
并留在公司里
and stay in their organization.
这都只是期望产生的结果
Just as result of expectation.
角色调换后结结果一样
The source of works of the other way,
Jamison在1997年做了一项很有趣的研究
Jamison, back in 1997, this fascinating study,
她想知道角色调换后是否有相同结果
where what she said was let's see if it works the other way.
她去到由同一名老师负责的两个班
So she went to two classes that were taught by the same teacher,
开始上课之前
and before the classes were started,
只告诉一个班
told just one of the classes
这位老师受到
that this teacher was ranked extremely highly
从前学生的极大好评
by other students before,
他们作为心理学家
that they, as professional psychologists rated
给这名老师极高的评价
that teacher as extremely high.
然后他们离开两个班
And they left them.
学年结束时 情况如何？
What happened by the end of the year?
首先 干预组给这名老师的评价
First of all, the teacher was rated higher
高于对照组
by the intervention group than by the control group.
而且学生对课业
But also, the students put in actually more time
付出更多时间 成绩比对照组好
into the class and they outperformed the control group.
因为他们相信
Because they believed--
他们被欺骗相信
they were made to believe that
这位老师的水平比实际情况高
the teacher was better that supposedly he/she were.
换言之 学生看到老师身上的潜力
In other words, they saw the potent6ial in the teacher.
学生们表现得…与老师无关
They performed-- not only the teacher;
老师没有更好的表现
the teacher did perform better--
但学生表现得更好了
but the students actually performed better
当他们有更高的期望时
when they had high expectations,
当他们相信自己的老师时
when they believed in their teachers.
如果各位想学好1504这门课
So if you want to do well in 1504--
你们知道该怎么做了 是吗？
you'll know what you need to do, right?
真得管用 信念即自我完成预言
It works-- beliefs as self-fulfilling prophecies.
我们创造我们的现实 歌德说过
We create our reality. Goethe,
"人是怎样便怎样待他 他便还是那样的人
"Treat a man as he is and he will remain as he is.
一个人能够或应该怎样便怎样待他
Treat a man as he can and should be,
他便会成为能够怎样或是应当怎样的人"
and he shall become as he can and  should be."
现在我想谈一个相关话题
I want to move on now to a related topic,
它对心理学家很重要
one that is very important for psychologist
对生活应用也很重要
but also for you to apply in your life.
那就是我们创造的情境
And that is the importance of situation we create
或为我们创造的情境的重要性
or that is created for us.
在很多方面 心理学家
In many ways, psychologist--
肯定地说是社会心理学家
social psychologist for sure--
都会被在情境之下完成的
was sponged by a series of research
一系列研究所影响
that was done on the power of the situation,
但多数是消极的情境
but it was mostly the negative power of the situation.
修读或没修读过初级心理学的
Those of you taken psych 1, those of you haven't,
可能都听说过"阿施从众心理实验"
may have heard of the "Asch Conformity Experiment",
个体对群体存在从众现象
where people conformed to the idea of the group.
很多同学可能听说过
Or many of you probably heard
Milgram的"权力服从"
of Milgram's "The obedience to authority".
如果没听说过
If you haven't heard about them,
我不会在这里深入介绍
I am not going to go in depth here,
阅读了解一下 去网上找一下
read about it. Just Google it.
两者都是心理学领域
Some of the most important fascinating studies
最精彩的研究 在街上随便找个人
in the field of psychology where a person off the street
在实验者的指示去电击另一个人
was told by an experimenter to shock another person,
甚至电击到另一个人尖叫恳求停止
even to the point where the other person is screaming to stop.
因为实验者说实验必须进行下去
And because the experimenters were saying the experiment must go on
而且实验者经常穿着一件白大褂
and very often had a white cloak like doctors or experimenters--
就像医生或者实验者
a cloak around them.
因为他们说实验必须进行下去
Because they said the experiment must go on,
经常的 人们会
very often, people went--
多数人 美国人都会继续电击那个人
most people, Americans went on and shocked that person,
甚至电击到另一个人哭泣
even to the point of the other person whimpering
恳求放他出去
and begging to be let out,
仅仅是因为那一句
simply because of the word,
"实验必须进行下去"
"the experiment must go on".
情境的力量 对权力的服从
The power of the situation, obedience to authority--
这项研究的目的是为了证明
this was done in order to show how something like the Holocaust
为什么大屠杀只发生在德国
could only happen in Germany;
那里的人更容易服从权力
how people are more likely to be obedient to authority
他们发现全世界的人
and what they found globally, worldwide,
都倾向服从权力
people have the tendency to be obedient to authority,
不论是在美国还是德国
whether it was in United States or in Germany.
全世界都是如何
Around the world.
如出一辙 情境的力量
Same replicated. The power of the situation.
Philip Zimbardo的监狱实验
Philip Zimbardo's Prison Experiment.
在斯坦福进行 他们做的是
This was done at Stanford, where they did was taking--
没读过的找来读
again, read about it if you haven't;
我不会深入介绍
I am not going to go in depth here--
他们从街上随便找来一些人
where they took people off the street
分别扮演典狱长
and had them play the role of either the prison warden,
狱警和犯人
the guard or the prisoner.
这项实验预计进行两周
And the experiment was supposed to go on for two weeks
证明进入角色的效果
to show what entering a role does.
一周后 他们发现
And what they found was after a week,
实验必须终止
the experiment had to be stopped.
因为随意找来的 随机分配的典狱长们
Because the wardens-- people off the street, randomly divided-
变得非常残暴
were becoming so oppressive.
他们侮辱犯人
They humiliated the prisoners
进入犯人角色的人受到侮辱
who got into their position of being humiliated,
就像犯人经常感受到的侮辱
just like prisoners often felt.
这解释了Abu Ghraib监狱丑闻
This explains Abu Ghraib.
时事现象
You know, current phenomenon--
伊拉克战俘的遭遇
what happened in the Iraqi prisons,
随便一个人一旦进入角色
of how people off the street enter the role--
他们进入得太深
they entered the role so much
Zimbardo不得不在一周后终止实验
that Zimbardo had to stop the experiment after one week.
可以去视频网站上看到
Go on YouTube and watch the video about this mind-boggling stuff.
这是很重要的
So this is only important,
知道很好 知道很重要 但不够
good to know,important to know, but not enough.
因为情境如此强大
Because the situation is so powerful,
为什么只强调消极的东西？
why just emphasize the negative?
为什么不创造积极的环境
Why not think about creating positive situations
让我们获得更快乐更讲道德的生活?
that will help us lead happier, more moral lives?
正像很多积极心理方法一样
And this has, just like a lot of positive psychological approaches,
被21比1的比率忽视
has been ignored with a ratio 21 to 1.
我要和大家分享这个领域的两项研究
So let me share with you just a couple of studies in this area.
两项研究都由本校的Ellen Langer完成
Both of them done by our very own Ellen Langer.
顺便说一句 我现在要讲到的这项研究
This, by the way, is the study that I am going to share now
是即将推出的Langer教授记录片的主干
is going to be backbone of a movie coming out about Professor Langer--
扮演Ellen Langer的演员 Langer是
the person who's going to play Ellen Langer--
1374
心理学系的第一位女性终身教授
she's the first female tenure professor in the psychology department
扮演Ellen Langer的是詹妮弗安妮斯顿
the person who's going to play Ellen Langer is Jennifer Aniston.
电影有望在一年后上映
And the movie is coming out, hopefully in a year,
但电影讲的是我要谈到的这项实验
but it's about the experiment that I am going to share with you now.
实验在1979年进行
So this was done in 1979.
Langer的实验是
Here was what Langer did.
她找来
What she did was take men
75岁以上的男人 把他们送去一座别墅
who were above 75 years old and sent them to a retreat,
那是间以1959为主题的别墅
which was a 1959 retreat, meaning--
虽然实验在1979年进行
even though it was 1979--
音乐来自1959年
the music was from 1959,
他们读的杂志都是1959年前后的
the magazines that they read that were all around were 1959,
日报是1959年的
the daily newspapers were 1959--
所有的一切都是1959年的
everything was 1959.
就算他们要进入角色
Even they had to go into a role,
和Zimbardo的实验一样
just like in Zimbardo,
要扮演1959年时的角色 仿佛年轻了20岁
they had to play their role of 1959 as if they were 20 years younger.
这是个心理学实验
Now of course, it was a psychological experiment,
在实验前后进行各种测量
they had all these different measures, taken before/after.
他们发现
And here is what they found.
在别墅待了一周
One week. Retreat.
在一周结束时
At the end of the week,
在一周结束时
At the end of the week,
心理和生理年纪都减小了
both mental and biological age decreased.
比如 他们在各项测试中变得更灵活
For example, they became more flexible in tests.
他们变得更强壮 他们手掌 双腿
They became stronger-- their grasp, their legs,
身体都变得更强壮
their bodies became stronger.
他们的记忆力有明显改善
Their memory improved significantly,
他们的智力水平
so their intelligence level as taking
在实验前后进行测试 再与对照组相比
by tests before and after compared to control group
在仅仅一周后就有明显改进
improved significantly after a single week.
她测量指骨间的距离
She measured the distance between the bones in the finger,
人越老 骨骼间空隙变得越小
because when we get older, the space becomes smaller--
指骨变得更紧
they become tighter.
一周后 他们的手指变长
The length after a week, increased in their fingers.
他们变得更快乐
They became happier.
变得更加自立
They became more self-sufficient,
更少依懒他们 不论是他们自己
less dependent on other people as rated by themselves
还是家庭成员的评估都是如此
and as rated by their family members.
他们变得更健康
They became healthier.
他们的视力和听觉有明显改善
Their eyesight and hearing improved significantly
在短短一周时间内
in as little as a week.
就是因为他们进入了强大的积极的情境
Just because they entered a powerful, positive situation,
与在外面世界遭遇的
which goes against a lot of the stereotypes
典型情况和偏见不同
and prejudices that they encountered in the outside world.
仅仅通过"扮演"某个角色
So just by "acting" a certain role,
他们变成那个角色 正如Zimbardo的犯人
they became that role just like Zimbardo's prisoners
在短短一周内真的变成犯人
became their role in as little as a week.
她的另一项研究
Another study that she did--
她在书中有叙述
and this is a report in her book,
《念》 我强烈推荐这本书
"Mindfulness", which I highly recommend.
她测量人们的视力
She took in and tested people's eyesight.
给他们一幅普通的视力表
And she gave them a normal eyesight chart,
测量他们的视力 记录结果
measured them, wrote down their performance.
然后她把让同一群人
And then she took the exact same people--
这次让他们穿上飞行服
this time, put them in a pilot overalls
同时让他们坐进飞行模拟器
and at the same time put them in a flight simulator
然后给他们看完全相同的视力表
and showed them the exact same the eye chart.
相同的距离 相同的视力表
Same distance, same eye chart,
唯一的不同是 他们坐在
the only difference being they're sitting in a flight simulator
飞行模拟器里 穿着飞行服
and they were wearing pilot overalls.
他们坐在那里看视力表
They were sitting there, looking at the eye chart.
然后她又进行了一次视力测试
And again, she ran the eye test.
40%的参与者的视力有明显改善
40% of participants eyesight improved significantly,
仅仅是在改变情境的情况下
as a result of just changing the situation.
相同的距离 相同的表 什么都一样
Same distance, same chart, same everything.
只是情境不同
Different situation.
问题是我们如何创造积极情境
The question is how do we create a positive situation.
如何创造一个利用角色自我改进的情境
How can we create a situation that improves us with the role.
我想介绍两个研究
And I want to share with you couple of studies--
先说第一个再说第二个 关于环境
I'll share one study and then another later-- about the environment.
首先是Barge的研究
First of all, the work of Barge,
影射分为潜意识和有意识影射
priming is when we have subconscious or conscious priming.
比如你看着一个屏幕
For example, you are looking at a screen
在几毫秒内闪过一个词
and for just a few milliseconds, a word appears.
这个词让你有了准备
And the word primes you.
有很多关于如何利用
There is a lot of research on
典型消极情况进行影射的研究 比如
how we can prime your negatively with stereotypes for example,
使用偏见
with prejudices.
或者积极的 但对积极影射的研究不够
Or positively-- but not enough from positively.
Barge做了下面的实验
So here's a story done by Barge.
他用与"老"有关的词影射人
He primed people with words associated with old.
比如"老"这个词
So for example, word such as old,
"拐杖"
word such as stick,
"佛罗里达"
word such as Florida--
他用这个词影射人们
that's one of the words he primed people with.
他用与老有关的词影射人们
So he primed people with "old" words.
然后他对比他们和对照组的
And then he had them take a comparative and control group
智力和记忆力测试结果
an intelligence test and a memory test.
用与"老"相关的词影射过的人的记忆力
The memory of the people who were primed with "old" words.
他们的表现比对照组差
They performed the worst than the control group.
第二 他观察这些人
Second, he looked at these people
记录他们从实验地点
and measured how fast they walk from
走到电梯的时间
where their experiment was to the elevator.
还找来盲测员
And also had blind evaluators--
那些不了解情况的人
people who didn't know which condition they were in,
评估他们的走路
evaluate how they were walking.
用"老"影射过的人行走起来
So the people who were primed with old actually walked
真得比其他人更弯腰驼背
more stoop than the other people.
走向电梯的速度明显慢
And they walk significantly slower toward the elevator,
虽然不知道自己被与"老"相关的字影射过
not knowing that they were primed with old words.
但他们走向电梯的速度
They walk slower toward the elevator.,
比没有受到影响的人慢
then the people who were not primed with these old words,
完全是潜意识的
subconscious completely.
然后他们用与"成就"相关的词
And then they did something priming people with words
影射人们
related to an achievement.
受到影射的人
The people who were primed,
用与"成就"有关的词进行潜意识影射的人
subconsciously with words related to achievement,
测试结果比对照组好
did better on tests than control group.
他们的记忆力得到改进
Their memory improved,
面对困难任务时更有持久力
and they persisted more on difficult tasks.
问题是…下次课我会谈到的是
And the question is-- the thing we'll talk about next time--
如何创造有意识的
is how can we create consciously
和潜意识的积极环境
and subconsciously a positive environment
让我们带出最有道德
where we actually can take out the most moral,
最成功的自我 并且去欣赏那个自我
most successful self, to appreciate that self,
帮助环境带出最杰出的自己
to help the environment bring out the best in us.
下堂课见
Next time.
