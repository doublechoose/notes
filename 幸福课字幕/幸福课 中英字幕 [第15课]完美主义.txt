幸福课 中英字幕 [第15课]完美主义
大家好 上节课我们学到了休整Student:Hello.Last lecture we learned about recovery.时不时地放下工作 放松一下自己At time,away from work really relax.我想邀请你们参加一项传统并且I'd like to invite you to join a traditional有历史渊源的休整节日 犹太安息日and time-tested recovery period,Shiva,the Jewish sabbath.这周五的晚上This Friday night,哈佛的Howard Hill和Hervat将邀请大家Howard Hill and Hervat at Harvard invite you and your friends来Mac中心享用犹太安息日大餐to Shiva dinner at the Mac for Shiva 1000.欢迎来到Mac中心的露天平台Come for free dinner at the deck down Mac和你的朋友们一起享用免费大餐with all of your friends,我们的Tal Ben-Shahar教授将会发表讲话where our very own professor Tal Ben-Shahar will be speaking.中心将于六点半开门 晚餐七点开始Doors are open at 630,and dinner starts at 7.如果想参加请迅速在Shiva1000.org上回复Please RSVP for this really fun event at Shiva1000.org.所有人都欢迎前来Everyone is invited,so please sign up.大家好Dr.Tal Ben-Shahar:Hi,good morning.我还被要求替女子垒球队通知大家I was also asked to announce on behalf of the Women Softball team她们原本是要来这里通知大家的They would've been here and they would've announced themselves,但是她们现在正在进行比赛 一场被推迟了的比赛but they are at the game and that was delayed.这周六和周日都有比赛There's a game this Sunday and...Saturday.Saturday and Sunday.还有男子棒球队And also for the men's baseball team.所以请去为他们欢呼 还有一个通知So come out and cheer.And one more announcement.他们听不见 抱歉 好的They can't hear.Sorry.Yeah.Yeah.好的 就是5月21号 九点十五分开始决赛All right.So May 21,9:15- day for the final.希望你们能过去看看Um hope you can make it.是周一 好的OK.It's a Monday.All right.每年只要我一要讲完美主义的课So every year when I teach the perfectionism lecture,就有点坏事要发生something happens.第一年So the first year,我记得我是把电脑忘在了家里I remember I actually forgot my computer at home.第二年 投影仪又坏了Second time,the projector didn't work.而这一年 我忘了带电源线了And this year I forgot my power,把电源线忘在了家里my power for the computer at home.所以希望这点电能支持一个学期So hopefully it will last the entire semester.如果不行的话我们就只能面对不完美了If not we'll just have to deal with the imperfect scenario,但是其实也没关系的but that's OK.这肯定是潜意识里的问题I think it must be something subconscious.因为这也太巧合了Because it's too much of a coincidence每次都有这些事情发生that every time something happens.的确是这样Walk the talk.39那么上次我们讲到哪了So where were we last time?上次我们讲到你们是怎么学会走路的Last time we talked about how you learned how to walk.我们讲到你们是怎么学会画圆圈的We learned about how you learned to draw circles.都是通过不断地失败 如爱迪生所说And all through failure.As Thomas Edison said,"我通过不断失败以至成功""I learned my way...I failed my way to success."我们从那些最顶尖的运动员身上看到And we saw it with top athletes,不管是Babe Ruth还是乔丹whether it was Babe Ruth or Michael Jordan.我们也从最顶尖的生意人身上看到We saw it with top business people,不管是IBM创始人Thomas Watson还是whether it was Thomas Watson,IBM or Anita Roddick,Anita Roddick 美体小铺的创始人founder of the,of Body Shop.我们从艺术家和科学家身上看到We see it with artist and scientist-最成功的人也是失败最多的人the most successful ones are also the ones who failed the most,而他们就是那些and these are the ones深刻明白失败的价值与重要性的人who understand the value and the importance of failure.我向你们保证 他们没人喜欢失败I guarantee you then none of them enjoy failing.失败让人受伤 让人极度失望Failing hurts; it's disappointing at best;让人沮丧 也经常使人尴尬it's frustrating; it's embarrassing often.但是 那些最为成功的人 都会However,people who ultimately succeed recognize认识到失败和从失败中学习的价值that value of failure and learning from it.有一本非常好的书There's a wonderful book是由我的一位导师最近完成的that came out recently by one of my mentors-他在商学院教了几年书he taught at the business school for a few years;他是一名在he is a professor南加州大学任职的教授 Warren Bennisat University of Southern California- Warren Bennis.Warren Bennis写了一本书And Warren Bennis wrote a book,名叫做《极客与怪杰》which is called "Geeks and Geezers".在这本书里And in the book,66他将非常年轻的顶多30岁出头的he compared very successful leaders who were young,年轻成功人士和老一代的early 30s and older generation leaders,真正有所成就的划时代领袖人物people who have really made it,他们多在七十岁 八十岁甚至九十岁以上big time leaders who are now in their 70s and 80s,sometimes 90s.他将两组人进行了对比And he compared these two groups:极客 指那些年轻的 怪杰 指年长的the geeks- the young ones; the geezers,the older ones.And而他发现 有一些what he found was that there were a number of very interesting非常有趣同时也很有意义的差异and meaningful differences between the generations存在于年轻的二十多到三十出头的成功人士of again highly successful late 20s or early 30 years old和年长的成功领袖人物之间and highly successful older individuals.其中最明显的差异就是One of the most notable differences was that work...工作与生活的平衡work life balance,这对于年轻的成功人士来说非常重要which is very important for the late 20s,early 30s.非常重要 他们自己也经常谈论这个Very important- they talked about it constantly,但是对于年老一代的成功人士那里whereas for the 70 80 90 year olds,这几乎完全就是一个外来观念it was almost a foreign concept.这是什么意思啊 为什么会这样呢What does that even mean? Why?因为他们总是处在工作中Because they were at work usually 24/7.在那个样本中所有人都是男性All of them in that sample were men.而女性则待在家里 负责生活的部分And the women were at home,taking care of the life part.所以说他们的工作与生活的平衡是So there was a work life balance- where they were doing the work,丈夫负责工作 妻子负责照顾生活the wives were doing the life.在年轻成功人士的样本里 男女都有Whereas the younger generation,men and women in that sample那他们自然会谈论到工作与生活的平衡and talking about the work life balance.两代人之间还有其它的不同There are a few other differences as well,但是也有一个相同点but there is one similarity,这一点对于两代人来说都是一样的one thing that was common to both groups.那就是有至少一次And that was at least one,一般来说要多于一次的 显著的失败usually more than one significant failure,Warren Bennis称其为"考验" 一次灾难what Warren Bennis came to call "a crucible",a real crisis无论是重要的竞争失败 或者失去了工作whether it was a meaningful loss or losing a job being fired,还是受到了屈辱 失去了亲人one's identity being insulted,loss of a person.一些严重的考验 一次失败的经历Some real serious crucible,a failure.这是两代人都共同拥有的That was common to both groups,他们都将失败看做一个关键点and both groups thought that failure as a pivotal point,一个生活的转折点as a turning point in their lives.一些帮助造就今天的他们的因素Something that helped them become who they are today.再说一遍 我不是说已经发生的是好事Again,not saying it happened for the best而是他们能够好好利用已经发生的事but they were able to make the best of that which happened.每个人都会经历考验Now most people experience crucibles都会面临困难和阻碍throughout their lives,hardships,difficulties,但是那些极度成功的人but difference between the highly successful people,如Warren Bennis的书里面写到的那些人for example the sample in Warren Bennis's book和一般人的不同之处在于and many other people is that他们能够好好地利用已经发生的事情they are able to make the best of what happens.他们将这些事情看成机遇They see it as an opportunity,一种学习的经历 一块垫脚石a learning experience,a stepping stone.这就是失败对于适应力与完善人格的作用The importance of failure for resilience,for well being as well.我们继续来定义一下完美主义吧So let me move on and define what we mean by perfectionism.因为现在有很多的定义Because there are many definitions我们经常提及这个词and we throw that word around constantly.但我要说的完美主义是什么But what do I actually mean by perfectionism?我的定义是I define it as:一种充斥在我们生活中的对失败的失能性恐惧an incapacitating fear of failure that permeates our lives,尤其是在我们最在意的方面especially those areas that we care about most.注意"失能性"这个词 不只是对失败的恐惧Note the word incapacitating.It is not just a fear of failure.好吧 我也不认识哪怕一个不害怕失败OK I don't know a person who is not afraid of failure,也不会因为失败感到尴尬或沮丧的人who is not embarrassed by it or feels frustrated by it.这是很自然的So that's natural.这就是人性 不管我们喜欢不喜欢That's human- whether we like it or not.但对失败的失能性畏惧是But an incapacitating fear of failure is the failure一种让我们在面对问题的时候that is debilitating us,that stops us,that prevents us裹足不前的的畏惧from coping,from trying,from putting ourselves on the line.而我要在这个定义里强调的另一点And the other part that I want to highlight in this definition就是"尤其是我们最在意的方面"is that "especially those areas that we care about most".你们也明白You know,我在玩大富翁的时候可不是完美主义者I am not a perfectionist when it comes to playing Monopoly.这也不是因为...It's not that这的确很有竞争性It's competitive.但是对于我来说胜败并不重要but it's not that important for me if I win or lose.但是完美主义确是我生活的重心But perfectionism was a central part of my life比如说 就如同我提到过的when it came to- as I mentioned earlier,壁球对我而言非常重要squash which was very meaningful to me,学术对我而言也非常重要academics which is very meaningful to me,and和别人的关系对我来说也非常重要relationships which was and is a very important part of my life.在这些方面 我就体会到了完美主义So in these areas,that's where I experienced perfectionism,也是在这些方面 我必须并且一直在努力and that's where I needed to do the work and still doing the work在这些方面 让我详细说明一下It's in those areas.Let me elaborate on this definition.这是我们在面对人生的旅途的时候It is an approach,a cognitive and emotional schema,也是我们从A点到B点的过程中that we hold toward the journey of our lives,采取的一种方式 一种认知与情感的基模toward the process of getting from point A to point B.重点在旅途上面The emphasis here is on journey.一个追求卓越的人仍可能和完美主义者A person committed to excellence can still be as ambitious一样 或者比完美主义者更有野心and more ambitious than a perfectionist.两者之间的不同The difference between the two在于他们面对旅途时的方式is just their approach toward the journey.我来举个例子 首先是一个完美主义者Let me illustrate.So let's first take the perfectionist.他正站在A点The perfectionist is currently at point A,他想到B点去wants to get to the point B.什么是最完美最有效率的方式呢What's the perfect,most efficient path between the two points?就是直的路线Straight line!这就是路线 这就完美主义者在面对This is the path- this is the cognitive and emotional schema旅途的时候抱有的认知与感情的基模that the perfectionist has when he or she looks at the journey,怎么从起点到终点how they want to get from where they are now to where they want to get to.一个追求卓越的人A person committed to,to excellence,和完美主义者一样雄心勃勃as ambitious as the person,perfectionist,也想从A点到B点去wants to get from point A to point B.没什么不一样 不同之处在哪里No different here.What is different?对于这段旅途 认知基模上的不同The cognitive schema that relates to the journey.追求卓越的人明白The person committed to excellence understands当他进步的时候 不可避免地会遭遇失败that while he improves,inevitably at some point,he would fail.一个追求卓越的人明白A perfectionist understands that有时候她不一定能拿到她想要的分数sometimes she may not get the grade that she expected,但她会吸取教训but she would learn from it.一个也明白在恋爱关系之中A perfectionist understands that in relationships根本就没有完美的恋爱关系there is no such thing as a perfect relationship所以 他会犯错and then therefore,he sometimes makes a mistake,她也会犯错so she sometimes makes a mistake,但他们都会不断吸取教训but they continue and they learn from it.然后他们的感情不断地变得更加坚固And the relationship becomes,gets stronger.完美主义者明白And a perfectionist understands that他需要不断地失败he needs to fail time and again-五次 十次 有时候一万次5 times,10 times,sometimes 10 thousand times就如同我们了解的爱迪生的故事那样as we saw with Edison until they get to the point B.一样地野心勃勃 但是基模有所不同As ambitious,but the schema is very different.我必须画出许多不好的圆圈I have to draw many failed circles在你们画出Vincent上次画出的那个圆以前before you get to that ideal circle that Vincent drew last time.现在的问题是 哪个才更现实And the question now becomes "so which is realistic?"拥有这样的基模是否现实Is it realistic to have that schema或者说这个才比较现实or is this one more realistic?我想这是很明显的Well,I think it's pretty obvious.要达到成功可没有直线的捷径There is no straight line toward success.要达成一段快乐的恋情也没有捷径There is no straight line toward a happy relationship.要发明电灯泡也没有捷径There is no straight line toward being inventing the light bulb,学好心理学也没有or being good at psychology,想成为好的父母或者朋友也没有or being a good parent or a good friend.我们会犯错We make mistakes.而且 自然的规律我们必须遵守And "nature to be commanded must be obeyed."追求卓越就是要克服困难Pursuing excellence is about a constraint view of nature.是啊 我也希望我能直接从A点到B点Yes,I wish that I could get from point A to point B in this way.我希望我能做到 我希望我不必经历失败I wish I were so.I didn't enjoy failing my generals;我不喜欢不断地失败与打壁球输掉I didn't enjoy falling down many times and losing in squash.我当然也不会喜欢和我妻子意见不合I certainly don't enjoy disagreements with my wife.我甚至宁愿没有万有引力定律However,I also would rather not have the law of gravity然后我就可以到处飞或者到处飘and be able to fly everywhere or float everywhere.这是现实 而这就是幻想了This is.This is a fantasy.当我们心中存在着这样的基模的时候And when we have this schema in our mind,我们就在让自己反抗自然规律we are putting ourselves,fighting nature,就如我们如果不接受万有引力定律的话and just like we would lead an unhappy and frustrating life,我们的生活就会充满不快与沮丧if we did not accept the law of gravity,我们活着 那么多人也活着 哈佛有不少人we live and so many people live- so many people at Harvard,不只是哈佛 所有地方都有 时常沮丧not just at Harvard,everywhere are frustrated constantly,因为在他们心里 他们一直有这样的基模because in their minds,they have this schema.再说一遍 这并不是说我们该享受失败And again,this does not mean that we enjoy failure.但当我们有这样的基模的时候But when we have this schema,同时又不享受失败in addition to not enjoying failure,我们就会因为难以接受事实而沮丧we have the frustration of not accepting reality.拥有这样的基模也会有后果的Now there are consequences to having this schema.我就想讨论一下这样的后果I want to discuss some of these consequences怀有拥有这样的基模的人的一些特征and some of the characteristics of a person who holds this schema根本就没有完美的完美主义者Now there is no perfect perfectionist.就如我说的 我们都存在于一个闭区间内As I said,we all exist somewhere along the continuum.确实有一些人And there are many people,确实有很多人更接近这个区间的这端again,many people here were closer to this end of the continuum.我想和你们分享的这些特征 都是那些The characteristics that I'd like to share with you are all ones已经被记载于文学作品之内的that are documented in literature.有很多人都拥有这样的特征There are many people who have them.你们大家或多或少都具有一些这样的特征You will identify with some of the characteristics,而不是别的特征not with others.这也没关系的That's fine.所有的这些特征 除了都已被心理学著作All the characteristics in addtion to being well documented in详述以外 我也都有过体会the psychological literature are also ones that I experienced,或者现在仍有所体会or still experience.所以这些特征对我来说具有一定的意义So these ones are personally meaningful to me,它们本身也非常常见in addtion to being also quite common.第一个是 自卫性The first one: defensiveness.在争论和讨论中 完美主义者都有自卫性In arguments,in discussions,perfectionists are defensive.为什么 因为批评在定义上就是一种Why? Because a criticism is by definition a deviation对于完美的直线方式的偏离from a straight line.这就是不完美 是一种挑刺It's imperfection.It's a daint.就是我没做得完美的事情It's something that maybe I'm not doing perfectly well.我们都不喜欢偏离我们所持基模的东西And we don't like deviations from a schema we have.记住了 我们的心是不喜欢内在与外在Remember,the mind doesn't like when there is an inconsistency之间的脱节的between what is inside and what is outside.我们需要的是平衡 一致We want there to be a balance,congruence.我们不喜欢横生枝节We don't like desinence.而如果我们心中抱有的是完美主义基模And if what we have in mind is the perfecionist schema,而批评又是对其的偏离the criticism is a deviation from it.那我们就会变得有自卫性And then we become defensive.这是我多次有所感受的Again,something that I experience numerously times;并且也是我一直在努力解决的something that I'm working on constantly.附带一提 或者说是正好相反In addition,or in constrast,一个追求卓越的人是心胸开阔的a person committed to excellence is open,他会欢迎时不时的建议与批评is welcoming of suggestions and criticisms at times.这不是说他或者她喜欢这样It doesn't mean that he or she enjoys it,而是他或她明白这是必要的but he or she understands that it's necessary,这是成长与发展的重要部分that it's an important part of growth,of development.完美主义者只注意到空着的那半个杯子Perfectionist focuses on the half empty part of the glass.为什么 因为完美主义者为失败所困扰Why? Because a perfectionist is obssessed by failure,被对直线完美方式的偏离所困扰obssessed by deviations from that straight narrow.而不管是什么 困扰我们的And whatever it is,what are obssessed with by definition就是我们所关注的is what we constantly focus on.他或她一直关注未能达成的东西So he or she constantly fosues on what is not working,关注潜在的可能失败或者是真正的失败on potential failures or actual failures.追求卓越的人Person committed to excellence则会专注于已经满的那半个杯子focuses on the half full part of the glass.为什么 因为他或她既享受达成目标How? Because he or she enjoys getting to where he or she is going又学会享受过程中的每一步 那就是旅途but also learns to enjoy every step of the way- the journey,即便是失败也能是机遇even failure is an opportunity.完美主义者会过度一般化 夸大化问题Person com...A perfectionist over generalizes,catastrophizes.非黑即白 我要么是完美的 要么一无是处It's all or nothing.Either I'm perfect,or I'm a failure.我们等一下就能看到And we'll see the consequences这样的"全部或没有"的对立于现实的方法in a minute of this "all or nothing" approach.造成的后果Versus realistic.我们又谈到了 明白现实是什么样的Again,realizing what reality looks like,明白事物的过程是怎么样的what progress in essence looks like.对于完美主义者来说 是没有自我接受的For perfectionist,there is no self-acceptance.对于追求卓越的人来说A person committed to excellence-能够接受现实中存在的各种弯路there is acceptance first of all of reality as comprising spirals而没有一步登天的捷径rather than a straight line.能够接受个人的失败Acceptance of personal failure能够将自己视作一个整体予以接受and the acceptance of the self as a whole.对完美主义者来说 只有一种方式是合适的Perfectionist- there is one way and that's the highway.并且是固定不变的It is a static.没有任何提升的空间 也没有丝毫偏离There is no improvization; there is no deviation;更没有问题和错误there is no trial and error.只有一种方式 而不是更为动态性的There is just one way in contrast to having much more dynamic,更有弹性与自发性的过程与旅途flexible process and journey,with much more sponetaneity,在行为中自我证实which manifests itself of course in behaviors.完美主义者恐惧失败 恐惧来自于内心的A perfectionist is terrified to failure- terrified that failure自己将自己视为失败者的失败from within that he or she perceives themselves as failures也恐惧他人将自己视为失败者but also that others see him or her as a failure.就是为了维持那种完美的幻觉Keeping that fa?ade,that image of impregnability of perfection.而不是将失败视为反馈 不是说要享受失败Versus failure as feedback.Again,not enjoying failure.我还没遇到过享受失败的人I haven't met a person who does enjoy failing,而是要将失败视为一种反馈和成长的机会but seeing it more as feedback,as a growth opportunity.完美主义者只想着怎么到达这里A perfectionist is all about getting here.他们只关注这个 只针对目的That's what it's about.This is a means toward an end.直来直去的Tangential.别的事情根本不重要Something that is not important如果它不能让我达到目的的话other than taking me from here to here.但对于追求卓越的人来说Or as for person committed to excellence,旅途和终点都是成功的一部分the journey is much part of the success as the destination.这样的基模上的差异Now there are numerous,numerous consequences to this distinction会导致很多的后果to holding one schema versus the other.我在这里列举一些Here are some of them.第一个 就是完美主义者只能感受到The first one is that a perfectionist experiences only,最多也只是 暂时性的轻松at best,temporary relief.是的So yes,他们会感受到持续的压力 但当他们there are constant pressure but when he or she gets to point B,达到目的之后 他们感到了轻松then they feel relieved.这就是典型的逐利者This is essentially the consummate rat racer.我来给你们一个这样的逐利者的例子Let me give you an example of such a rat racer.一个人 我们姑且称他为X先生The person- let's call him X-去上学了 上小学goes to school,goes to an elementary school.在那之前Until that point,他一直很享受学前的生活he really enjoyed his day care,pre-K,kindergarten.而他上学以后就开始有压力了And then he goes to school and the pressure begins.因为他明白 他必须很努力地读书Because he begins to understand he really needs to work very hard并取得非常好的成绩来上一个好初中and do extremely well if he is to get into a good middle school.因为他父母想让他进的那间初中Because the middle school that his parents want him to go to竞争很激烈 非常不好进is very competitive,very tough to get into.他确实进了一间不错的小学And he did get into a very good elementary school.但是现在他要为初中而努力了But now he has to do the same for middle school.所以他有了压力 他并不享受小学生活So the pressure mounts.And he doesn't really enjoy school.但他确实感受过轻松 在假期到来的时候But then he experiences relief when the holidays come,在全家去度假 或者考试结束的时候when they go on a family vacation or when the exams end and00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,030在他可以不用担心考试和朋友玩的时候he can play with his friends without thinking of the next test.他经过了小学阶段 却不怎么喜欢He goes through school,not really liking it,他感受过轻松 却丝毫没有感受过experiencing more series of reliefs rather than passion在他还在幼儿园的时候感受过的那种and love of learning which he did experience对于学习的热情与喜爱when he was in kindergarten,but no more.他后来进入了梦想中的初中And he gets into his dream middle school-那所他一直想要进入的初中the middle school that he was meant to go to all along.他做到了He makes it.他只在前两周里感觉非常高兴And he feels wonderful and great and terrific for 2 weeks.因为他要开始考虑Because he now needs to start thinking about他梦想中的高中了the high school of his dreams.为什么 因为那所高中Why? Because that high school是进入全国最好的那些大学的垫脚石is a feeder school for the top colleges in the country.他也很想进入一间全国最好的大学And he really wants to get into one of those.所以他在初中又很努力地学习So he really struggles and works hard during,in middle school.他并不怎么享受这样努力的过程He doesn't really enjoy his work.但是他成功了 他进入了梦想中的高中But he makes it,and he gets into his dream high school.他很兴奋 从来没有这么高兴过And he is ecstatic.Happier than he had ever been before.因为他已经是全国最出色的孩子中的一员Because here he is- among the smartest kids in the country.进这所高中不容易 但是他做到了Very difficult to get into this school- but he makes it.然后他又开始学习And there he starts to learn.他又只开心了一周 压力又来了He's happy for about a week and then the pressure mounts因为这所高中里面竞争非常激烈because it is a very competitive school他必须加入两个运动队and he has to join two varsity sports还有三个学生组织 因为他必须and three students organizations because he has to pad,充实他的简历好让自己进入梦想中的大学to build his resume so that he gets into his dream college.他过得很挣扎 一点意思也没有And he struggles,and it's not fun.但是他对自己说"这只是暂时的But he says to himself,"this is just temporary.痛苦是短暂的 等我进入了全国最优秀的It's only pain now,because later there will be gain-大学就会有回报的" 然后他付诸行动once I get into my top college." And he applies.在4月2号 一封信来了And on April 2,there is an envelope that arrives.信的信封很大 他打开信知道自己成功了And the envelope is large.And he opens it up and he gets in.他又感到非常地兴奋And he is ecstatic,甚至比进入高中时还高兴happier even that he was when he got into his dream high school.然后他说 "现在 我终于能放手And he says,"now,finally,I can let go.好好地放松一下了Now finally,I can relax.因为我已经进了这间大学Because I've already made...I mean this top college.我的人生从此稳定下来了"And I'm set for life."接下来他十分享受高中的最后一年And he really enjoys the rest of senior year还有假期以及进入大学的第一周and the holiday and then the freshman week comes.他很兴奋 这位X先生And he is ecstatic- Mr X.但是在第一周过去后 压力又出现了But then after that week,the pressure mounts again.因为很快就会到期中考试Because very soon there are midterms.而很快又会出现激烈的竞争And very soon there is competition.并且每个人都和他一样努力And everyone is working as hard as he did.因此他也必须非常地努力And he has to work really hard因为他想得到他的梦想中的工作because he wants to get his dream job.他在大一暑假的时候得到了理想的实习机会And then he gets his ideal internship during freshman summer但是压力又继续出现了and the pressure continues.他感受过轻松 也感受过愉快的时光There are reliefs; there are fun periods.但是这些都是在考试结束以后And these are periods when the exams are just over或者假期即将到来之前or when break is coming up.或者是在假期期间Or during break.但是每次都一样 压力又出现了But then again,the pressure mounts.他自己也不明白为什么他不开心He doesn't really understand why he's not happy因为这一切都是他想要的because I mean this was where he really wanted to be,他非常想要这些 多于别的一切he really really wanted to be- more than any other place.他说"好的 只要我得到这份工作就好了" 为什么But he says "OK,once I get that job then I'll be set." Why?因为那份工作能让我进入最好的商学院Because that job will really get me into the top business school.这能让我在一千六百个It will really differentiate me from all the other 1600 students一同毕业的人中脱颖而出who will graduate with me.所以他继续努力 继续充实他的简历So he works hard,still builds his resume.他是三个学生组织的成员 担任两个的部长He's a member of 3 students organizations,president of two.是两个大学运动预备队员 一个正式队员JV in two sports and varsity in one,plus taking five,还要加上每学期五门甚至六门课and sometimes six courses in a semester.为什么 因为这很困难 竞争很激烈Why? Because it's tough.It's competitive.这就是适者生存 不付出就没有收获And it's the survival of the fittest.And no pain,no gain.大学最后一年到来了 他又有压力了Senior year finally comes and there's pressure.但是他得到了那份工作 他很高兴But then he gets his job.He's happy.这就是他想要的This is exactly what he wanted.这就是他所预想的This is exactly what he envisioned.现在他很高兴And now he's happy.然后8月3号到了And then comes August 3,是他正式开始工作的第一天which is the date when he starts his actual work.他上班去And he goes to his work他周围的所有人都是最高等学府的and everyone around him is graduated毕业生 都是最优秀学校的学生from top universities,top places.他觉得已经功成名就 却只高兴了两周He feels on top of the world.And he's happy for 2 weeks.因为在两周以后Because after 2 weeks,他又感受到了非常大的压力he realizes there is a lot of pressure here,比大学里面的压力还要大actually much more than it was in college.他没有时间再像大学里面一样在饭堂里And he can't have time for those long leisurely dinners悠闲地吃晚饭in the dinning hall.他每周工作八十到九十小时 一点也不享受He's working 80 t0 90 hours a week and not really enjoying it.但是他会做到的 他会做得很好的But he'll make it.He'll get there.他会得到一封很好的进商学院的推荐信He'll do well,get a good recommendation for business school,在从商学院毕业以后and then after business school,找到一个真正的理想工作并享受生活get his real dream job and then he can enjoy himself.然后他真的进了最高的商业学院And he gets into his top business school choice也找到了他最好的工作and then he gets his top job.工作上 作为一个员工 他很高兴And in his job,as an associate,he's really happy.事实上他甚至不敢相信自己的好运In fact he can't believe his good fortune.他赚钱赚得很多He's making a lot of money.那三年前看起来难以忍受的助学贷款Those student debt looked so serious现在一下子就还清了and over-bearing only 3 years ago and now are paid in an instant.他感觉很棒He feels good.他有了一间很不错的公寓He has a nice apartment他成了员工 他很兴奋and he becomes an associate and he's ecstatic.他很高兴 "我终于做到了"He's happy,"I finally made it!"但是过了几个月 压力又回来了But a month goes by and the knot returns.因为他只是一个员工Because he's only an associate.他非常非常想成为合伙人He now really,really wants to make partner.但当他成为合伙人以后But once he's partner,当他获得了"终身任期"以后once he got the so called "tenure" of the business world,他的生活就可以安顿下来了then he'll be all set.他继续努力工作 奋力拼搏And he works hard.He struggles.他不怎么喜欢他的工作He doesn't really enjoy his work.只要再努力多一点 再忍受多一点痛苦But he says,"just another push.A little bit more pain.然后就会有真正的回报了And then the real gain."在艰苦努力了五年以后 他又做到了And after 5 years of pushing hard,he makes it.他成为了合伙人 事实上And he becomes a partner- in fact,也是那个公司历史上最年轻的合伙人one of the youngest partners in the history of the organization.他很兴奋And he's ecstatic.他休了一个长假 然后回来工作He takes a long break and comes back after the break,斗志满满all motivated.因为他现在是所有者Because now he's owner,是这个著名的公司的所有者之一part-owner of this great prestigious organization.现在他也已经成家了And by now he has a family now already.And他买下了市郊的一座大房子 非常贵he buys a huge house in one of the suburbs of the city,expensive但是他轻易买下了 他也买了一辆豪华车But he bought it easily.And he buys a luxury car.他还有了一个司机 他感觉真的功成名就了In fact he has a driver by now.And he feels on top of the world.他感觉良好地过了三个月 压力又来了He feels great for 3 months.And then the pressure returns.因为他只是一个初级合伙人Because he's only a junior partner.他能成为高级合伙人吗 这可能吗Can he make the senior partnership? Is it possible?00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,980好吧 只有努力工作才可能Well,only if he works hard因为没多少人能爬到金字塔那么高的位置because a few people make it that high up in the pyramid.越来越难了 但是他会成功的It's getting tougher.But he'll make it.他挣扎着 忍受着 一点意思也没有So he struggles and he suffers,and it's not fun.但是他成功了 没有付出 就没有回报But he makes it.No pain,no gain.这一次 他在Hamptons区买了一栋房子And by this time,he's just bought another house in the Hamptons-用来度假和休息just for the holidays,for the breaks.还有一辆新车 更大 也更快And there's another car- a bigger one,a faster one.然后他说 我终于 终于 能够放松了And now he says,"I can finally,finally relax."然后他开始放松自己 过了两个半月And he does relax.For 2 and a half months.压力又回来了 因为他只是个高级合伙人And then the pressure returns.Because he's a senior partner.但是常务董事只有一个But there is only one managing director.Only one.想得到那个位置是非常困难的And to get that would be really tough.但是他决心要当上常务董事But he's determined to do it.他一直是明星级人物 没理由止步不前He's been a star; there's no reason to just stop now.这对他来说没什么乐趣可言It's not fun for him.他没有花多少时间和他爱的人一起He doesn't spend that much time with people he loves,而因为他心中的焦虑 他必须证明自己because he's constantly stressed; he has to prove himself.465足足花了七年时间And for 7 long years,在这七年内 他在物质上已经很富足了while there is material affluence for those 7 years,只是愈发地缺乏时间there is time poverty,time famine.他不断地奋斗 最后终于成功了But he continues to struggle and he makes it.董事会发表了任命声明The board makes an announcement.他登上了华尔街日报的头版新闻He's on the Wall Street Journal,front page news:X先生成为了这件传奇公司的常务董事Mr X is the new managing director of this incredible organization他的朋友们祝贺他And his friends congratulate him.他感觉万分自豪 他很快乐He feels on top of the world.And he's happy.但是随后焦虑回来了But then the stress returns.有一天他走进办公室里But then one day,one day he walks into his office,坐在椅子上 脚搭在桌子上sits on his chair,puts his legs up on the table.他已经成了老板 成了掌门人He's after all the Boss,the Man.他回头就可以看见中央公园He looks back and sees central park.那景色实在太美了Just beautiful there.他真的是 而不是修辞地说He really is,not just metaphorically speaking-他真的是站在了世界之巅he really is on top of the world.然后有人敲门了And then there is a knock on the door.他被敲门声吓了一跳He's surprised by the knock,因为一般来人了他的秘书会向他通报because usually his secretary announces people-访客不会就这么过来敲门they don't just knock on his door.毕竟他是站在世界之巅的人He's after all,on top of the world.于是他走过去开了门So he walks down and opens the door.来人是董事会主席And it's the chairman of the board.他们俩互相打了个招呼And she says hi to him.He says hi back.然后董事会主席说 "今年的盈利记录And she says,"you know,record earnings this year.非常之棒 不可思议 您做得太好了Well done! Fantastic! You have done amazing,amazing work.我们都为您而骄傲 感谢您的存在We are all so proud of you.So glad you are in your position.但是 您应该退休了 您已经72岁了"However,it's time to retire.You are 72 years old."这就是逐利者的生活 最佳情况下This is the life of the rat racer- at best.当然这只是大概的描述And again,this is a caricature.我只是着重描述了几个特殊的阶段I've highlighted just certain points.这也不是要么全部要么没有It's not as all or nothing.但是 总的来说 这就是逐利者的生活However,in essence,this is the life of the rat racer-只关注从A点到达B点about getting from point A to point B00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,210然后轻松半个到一个月and then feeling relief for two weeks or a month.然后...B点又变成了新的A点And then getting...point B becomes point A.然后 就像一直不断向上爬的老鼠And again,like the rat running around on and on and on and on.你们必须现在就问自己 不现在问那还要等多久And you need to ask yourselves now- because not now then when?你们必须现在就问自己You need to ask yourselves now,"我到底想要什么样的生活""what kind of life do I want for myself?"我给的是一个生意场上的例子I gave an example of business.其实对于其他领域也一样It applies as much to any other domain-不管你是想成为一个医生whether you are,want to become a medical doctor是因为能否上到最好的学校而有压力and going on and feeling pressure to get into the best schools,是想要最好的公寓 最好的实习机会the best department,the best internship,最想要好的 最高的职位等等the best,the highest position and on and on;或者你是打算为非盈利机构工作or whether you are working for a non profit organization;无论你是留在学术界 还是成为律师or whether you are in academia; or a lawyer.都一样 都是在不同领域重复X先生的故事It doesn't matter- just filling the blank of Mr X in which area.这样的情况适用于任何地方It applies to any place.问题就是 "我们想要什么样的生活"And the question is,"what kind of life do I want for myself?"要记住其中最重要的And remember the most important thing,一个追求卓越的人a person committed to excellence不会放弃自己的雄心does not give up on being ambitious.但是 一个追求卓越的人However,a person committed to excellence也不会放弃整个旅途does not also give up on the journey.我们很快也会讲到And as we'll talk about soon,追求卓越的人a person who is committed to excellence,不仅仅不会放弃整个旅途not only does he or she not give up on the journey或者结果or rather on the outcome,他们常常会获得更高的成就they actually reach higher levels of performance.我们很快就会讲到But we'll get to that soon.追求卓越的人A person committed to excellence并不只关注短时间的放松is not just about temporary relief,还关注长久的满足but about lasting satisfaction.是的 生活中会有起起伏伏Yes,she has the ups and downs like we all do.但是 也能够享受旅途中的每一天However,also able to enjoy the journey day to day-在大学里的经历the experience being the college,和朋友们美美地吃了一餐的经历the experience of having a lovely meal with my friends,阅读名家的作品的经历the experience of reading and being exposed to great writers,上有趣的课 参加有趣的课外活动的经历to interesting classes,to nice extra curricular activities,并且重视这样的经历 而不是忽略它们and appreciating it,not taking it for granted,不是把这些看做普通的not seeing it as just incidental-为了成功的最终目的just something that I need to get through我必须经历的事情in order to get to where I really want to get to.你或许会非常渴望成功Well,you may want to get...really want to get there,但是你所在的却是此时 此地but where you really are is here and now.不是别处No other place.你们也知道 我从来没有 或许你们有You know,I haven't met,maybe you have,我从来没有遇见过完美的人but I haven't met the perfect person.我认为这样的人是不存在的I don't think that person exists.换句话说 如果根本就不存在完美的人In other words,if there isn't a person,a perfect person,那么对每个人来说 失败都是不可避免的for every person,there's inevitable failure.为失败所困惑的完美主义者And a perfectionist who is obsessed with failure只是专注于失败 而追求卓越的人just focuses on that,whereas the person committed to excellence,则会发现路途上每一步都有成功的机会there is possibility of success every step of the way,甚至在失败中也有这样的机会even in failure.完美主义者常常将时间浪费在A perfectionist very often wastes time-必须读清楚每个字has to read every word,every..."我要做到最好 拿满分"You know,"i have to be dotted,every t crossed."要么全部要么没有It's all or nothing.要么我交上去一份完美的论文Either I hand in a perfect paper,要么我就干脆不交论文or I don't hand in a paper at all.要么我就拿到A 要么我就一无是处Either it's a straight A,or I'm a failure.要么全部要么没有 有时候这是合适的All or nothing.And sometimes,it's appropriate.有时候追求卓越的人也会持有这种态度And that's what a person committed to excellence does-比如understands when,for example,如果你是一个医生 你想做一场完美的手术if you are a surgeon,you want to have the perfect operation.你可不会说 "好吧 没关系啊You don't want to say,"well,it's OK.我切对了八成应该切的东西"I'm 80 percent right about where exactly to cut."没错 在有些场合你会需要完美主义Yeah,there are places where you want the perfectionism.但是在我们生活中的其他方面 都不必要But in many other areas in our lives,it's not necessary.甚至会伤害我们 完美主义者往往倾向混乱And it hurts us.A perfectionist is very often prone to disorders.我是指多方面的混乱And I mean disorders of numerous times including,比如进食问题for example,eating disorder.我来给你们提供一个个人的例子吧So let me give you a personal example.在我还在打职业壁球的时候So when I was playing squash,when I was playing full time,我必须控制我的食谱 要吃得健康吃得好I had to really take care of my diet- eat healthfully,eat well.但还是产生了问题But there was a problem.我的生活中有一项重大挑战There was a real challenge in my life.这挑战就是我的母亲个完美的大厨And that challenge was my mother who is the perfect cook.她做的的蛋糕尤其诱人And her cakes are outstanding.于是就有了这样的我在长大的时候So here is the common scenario that常常遇到的状况 痛苦的童年I encountered growing up- tough childhood:我在壁球训练过后回家I would come home after the squash practice,饿得要命地打开冰箱open the fridge,starving.然后那里面有一大块蛋糕And there was a large piece of cake.不是一整个 但差不多四分之一个Not a whole cake,but you know a quarter cake,非常大的一块 实在是非常诱人very large,so inviting.So alluring.我根据以往的经验知道 这很好吃And I know from past experiences it's so delicious.我看着这块蛋糕 然后关上了冰箱门I look at it.And then I close the fridge.因为我不能吃Because I can't have it.当时我正在在为一个重要的巡回赛训练I'm in middle of training for an important tournament.但是在三分钟以后But three minutes later,我回到冰箱那看蛋糕还在不在I go to the fridge again,just to make sure it's still there.为什么 你们中认识我兄弟的都明白Why? Those of you who know my brother understand why.我兄弟块头比我大多了My brother is much bigger than I am.他对我母亲的厨艺的喜爱一点不在我之下And he likes my mom's cooking no less than I do.所以我去确定蛋糕还在那So I was just making sure that it was still there.确实还在And it was.再过了十分钟 我必须再去检查一遍And then 10 minutes later,I had to go back because my brother因为我兄弟在我视线内消失了几分钟had just disappeared from my eyes a few minutes.我以为他到冰箱那去了I thought he went to the fridge.所以我又打开了冰箱一次 蛋糕还在So I opened the fridge again and it was still there.然后我感到一阵轻松So I was relieved.大约五分钟以后我又回到冰箱那里And about 5 minutes later I had to go back to the fridge.我打开冰箱门 两分钟以后蛋糕就不见了I opened the door and two minutes later,there was no cake.要么全部要么没有 要么我不碰要么我吃完All or nothing.Either I don't touch it,or I devour it.这就是完美主义者持有的基模This is the schema that a perfectionist has.不会说"好吧 我就吃一块" 要么不吃要么吃完It's not "OK,let me have a slice of it." It's nothing or all.所以这就是完美主义者的基模And this is the schema that perfectionists have:我要么成为超级模特 要么超重either I'm a supermodel or I'm overweight.要么全部要么没有 这是很有破坏力的All or nothing.And it's destructive.这会对我们产生各个层次的严重伤害It hurts so much on so many levels.相对于健康的方式而言As opposed to the healthy approach.好的 我就吃一小块OK,so I'll have a slice.So I'll have a little bit.好的 我重了几磅 这算大事吗 我是人OK,so I gained a couple of pounds- big deal?! I'm human.我不是机器 也不是芭比娃娃 更不是KenI'm not a machine.I'm not a Barbie.Or Ken.(Laugh)我说错话了I caught myself there.这很伤自尊 为什么 因为Hurts self-esteem.Why? Because...Nathaniel Branden写过很多关于自尊的文字Nathaniel Branden who writes about self-esteem-我们在未来三周内将会更多地讲到他we'll talk a lot about him in that lecture 3 weeks from now.自尊的第一个基础就是自我接受The first pillar of self-esteem is self-acceptance.要记得完美主义者是不接受自我的And remember a perfectionist does not accept him/herself.第二个伤害自尊的原因是Second,the reason why it hurts self-esteem- remember,完美主义者总会遇到长期且不可避免的失败there is constant,inevitable failure for a perfectionist因为根本就没有完美的人because there is no perfect person.And而如果我一直失败或者视自己为失败者if I constantly fail or constantly perceive myself as a failure,那我还会有较高的自尊心吗 当然不会am I going to have high self-esteem? Of course not.另一个完美主义者容易自尊心受伤的原因It also hurts self-esteem because a perfectionist是他们更不愿意去尝试is less likely to try,less like to put him/herself on the line.而如果我不愿意尝试的话 其后果就是And the price that I pay for that更加低的自尊心when I don't try is lower level of self-esteem.还记得自我知觉理论吗Remember self-perception theory.00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:32,260相对的是持续的自我提升Versus on-going,continuous improvement.不是一条直线直上的 而是旋转向上的Not a straight line,but a spiral that goes up and up.完美主义伤害人际关系Perfectionism harms relationships.回想过去 我从这个角度来说Again,I just look back and I,you know from this perspective,我很难捉摸 我基于完美主义it's hard for me to fathom the kind of mistakes在人际关系中所犯的错误的类型that I have made in relationships based on perfectionism.为什么 第一 自卫性Why? First of all,defensiveness.如果我一直是处于自卫性的位置It is very difficult to form intimacy with some one如果我不能接受或者处理批评when I'm constantly on the defensive,when I can't accept那我就很难和别人形成亲密的关系or do something at the very least with criticisms.这样的情况下怎么可能建立亲密关系呢What kind of intimacy is possible there?另一个完美主义伤害人际关系的原因是The other reason why it harms relationships我们经常is that very often,we mirror...我们对世界的看法和对自己的看法一样Our approach to the world mirrors our approach toward ourselves.如果我是完美主义者那我期望的就是完美So if I'm a perfectionist and expect perfectionism-对我来说是一条直线 对他人亦是如此a straight line for myself,I would expect the same from others,不论是对于我的伴侣whether it's from my partner,还是对我的孩子和朋友whether it's later on my children or friends.现在我们...And now as we...我以前也说过了 没有完美的人I think- I establish before- there is no perfect person.我们第一次见面的时候可能感觉是完美的Now it may seem perfect when we first meet.在度蜜月的时候 也是完美的And during the honeymoon phase,it is perfect.他或她是完美的He or she is perfect.但是突然 我们开始发现对方的缺点了But beyond that,suddenly,we begin to identify flaws.Hey,那不是我一开始以为可以在一起的那人that's not the person I thought I got together with initially.当然 如果我期待的是芭比娃娃或Ken的话Yes,of course it's not,if what I expect is Barbie or Ken.完美的 但是对方可是人Straight line.But it's a human being.如果我从对方身上期待的是完美And if I expect perfectionism from the other,我肯定会失望的I will inevitably be disappointed.这也会引起沮丧And that leads to frustration,对自己的伴侣不认可lacks of acceptance toward the partner,也常常会伤害到人与人之间的关系and very often,usually harms the relationship.相对于持续成长的关系来说Versus on-going growth of the relationship,这是我们会在谈论人际关系的时候谈论到的as we'll talk about when we talk about relationships.理想的人际关系The ideal relationship不是一个没有失败is not a relationship that is devoid of failure,没有不和的关系that is devoid of disagreements.理想的人际关系在包含众多积极因素同时The ideal relationship is one where there's mostly good stuff,也会包含不和 失望和争吵but there's also disagreements,disappointments,fights.那才是健康的人际关系That's actually healthy.这让人际关系随时间变得更加稳固It helps the relationship become stronger over time.关键是其中的度The issue is of degree.你在人际关系中包含的How much positive versus negative积极因素与消极因素各是多少do you have in the relationship?这里的关键不是只有积极而没有消极的因素The issue is not having only positives and no negatives.这样的关系是不健康的That's not a healthy relationship.这样的关系That's a relationship有过多的抑制与压抑with a lot of suppression and repression at best.完美主义会导致焦虑和压力Perfectionism leads to anxiety,leads to stress.总会有对于失败的恐惧There is always a fear of failure.而不是兴奋Versus excitement.这就是Peter Senge所说的"创造性张力"What Peter Senge called "creative tension".但是表现如何But what about performance?那句已经镌刻在我们心中的What about the "no pain,no gain" mantra"没有付出就没有收获"的真言呢that's drilled into our mind constantly?我是说我们很清楚地都知道I mean we know self-evident that我们必须要努力才能成功we need to work hard in order to succeed.那难道我不应成为完美主义者吗So shouldn't I be a perfectionist?而人们不愿放弃这种方式的一个原因是And one of the main reasons why people don't give up the schema他们认为这是最快的方法is because they think this is the fastest way,是最为有效的通往成功的方法most efficient way to success.但是最后事情往往都不是那样的But it turns out that it's not the case,长久来看 追求卓越的人往往that actually the person committed to excellence会取得更好的成就is more successful in the long run.在这方面有很多研究进行了阐释And there is a lot of research that illustrates this.我来举出一些成果 一些原因Let me share some of it.Some of the reasons.现在说说少一点付出 多一点收获Now,less pain,more gain.首先 以终极货币的形式First of all,in the ultimate currency,用幸福来进行衡量the most important currency of happiness.追求卓越的人People committed to excellence远比完美主义者要快乐as opposed to perfectionists are happier.这很好 也很棒So that's wonderful and that's great.但也不仅仅是在终极货币价值方面But it's not just in the ultimate currency,在硬通货等物质方面也是同样的it's also in the hard currency,不管是工作上的成功 还是体育上的成功whether it's success at work,whether it's success for athletes,还是处理人际关系上的成功whether it's success in relationships.为什么 其中有很多原因Various reasons.首先 追求卓越的人First of all,person committed to excellence享受更加可持续的成长enjoys much more sustainable approach to growth.记住了Remember,这个我从环保方面引用的词 可持续增长the analogy that I use from environmentalism- sustainable growth.不是要创造一个贫瘠的环境It's not about having a sterile environment.不是关于回到以狩猎与采集为It's not about going back to the days of主要生活方式的时代去的when we lived as hunters and gathers in caves.是关于以现代生活方式生活It is living in accordance of modern life.是关于享受进步与现代性 与此同时It is enjoying modernity and progress,but at the same time,不从环境中索取过多not taking too much out of the environment让发展得以持续下去so that it can sustain itself.放到个人层面上也是一样的The same on the individual level.完美主义者不会享受持续性的成长A perfectionist does not enjoy sustainable approach to growth.因为他们不允许休整和偏离Because there are no places for recovery,no places for deviation所有东西都是不变的 如同一台机器Everything is static like a machine.至于追求卓越的人As opposed to a person committed to excellence:有所偏离 有所中断 也有休整there are deviations,there are breaks,there are recoveries.相比起来更加可持续 如果我受伤了Much more sustainable.Versus all or nothing.I got injured.我的壁球生涯就结束了 因为要么全部要么没有My squash career ended because it was all or nothing.要么我就完全不训练Either I don't train at all要么我就像世界冠军Jansher Khan那样训练or I train like Jansher Khan,the world champion.同时追求卓越的人所拥有的Also intrinsic motivation固有动力也比完美主义者高很多is much higher for people committed to excellence.当我们有固有动力的时候And when we have intrinsic motivation,我们就能更好地在一段时间内持续地we are much more likely to sustain effort付出努力over a long period of time,如果所有的动力都是固有不会减退的and if all the motivation is intrinsic.那就能上升到另一个层次Comes to getting to that next stage.获得嘉奖 或者能得到升迁Getting those accolades.Getting that raise and so on.丘吉尔说完美主义让人瘫痪Winston Churchill said that perfectionism spells paralysis.当我们被失败所困扰的时候When we are so obsessed with failure,我们就更不会付诸行动we are much less likely to act.完美主义是事情耽搁的最主要原因之一One of the primary causes of procrastination is perfectionism-对失败的失能性畏惧the incapacitating fear of failure.因为只要我们不行动 我们就不会失败Cause if we don't act,we don't fail.就如同我之前说的 追求卓越的人的自尊Self-esteem as I mentioned earlier相比起来更高is much higher for a person committed to excellence.而且如Nathaniel Branden所说 自我知觉And as Nathaniel Branden said,self concept is destiny;是终点 而信念变成自我实现预言beliefs become self-fulfilling prophecies.如果我相信我自己 如果我认为我能成功If I believe in myself,if I think I can succeed,如果我的过去有跌倒之后if I have the track record to show that又爬起来的经历I get up after falling down,那我就更可能成功I'm much more likely to succeed over time.我以前讲过这个吗 好的Did I mention this before? Oh.OK.Good.因为这很重要 要成功没有别的方式Because it is important.There is no other way to succeed.你们读到了"运气的因素"You are at "the Luck Factor",英国的Wiseman教授极为优秀的作品the fantastic work by Wiseman,UK professor.他所说的是 比别人有更多运气的原因And what he talks about,one of the causes of having more luck似乎是一件很神秘的事情in our lives seems like a mystical thing,但其实也是可以用科学方法解释的but actually can be shown scientifically.其中一个有更好运气的方法One of the ways of having more luck便是尝试新事情 小事情in our lives is to try new things,little things,即使是你课后去食堂的路上even when you walk back to your dining hall after class.找一条和你每天所走的那条路Take a slightly different path,as opposed to the path有些许不同的路线that has already been taken by you every single day.而她说 这些小事就可以改变我们的生活And he says these little changes in our lives,这些小小的对于直线方式的偏离实际上these slight deviations from a straight narrow actually能带来更多的幸运lead to higher levels of luck,因为我们开始看见以前没见过的东西because we begin to see things that we haven't seen before.完美主义者 只有一条路Perfectionist- one way;没有偏离 没有进步 没有自发性no deviations,no improvisation,no spontaneity.这些时常都让我们变得不那么"幸运"This very often prevents us from being "luckier".说到创造力 Simonton说 那些历史上Creativity- Simonton: the most successful,最成功 最有创造力的科学家和艺术家the most creative scientist and artist throughout the history都是那些失败得最多的are ones that fail the most.他们都不是完美主义者They were not perfectionists.他们都追求卓越 非常有雄心They were committed to excellence- extremely ambitious,都明白要成功没有别的方法understanding that there's no other way to succeed.John Updike 一位非常有创造力的作家John Updike,highly creative author,说过"完美主义是创造力的敌人"says "perfectionism is the enemy of creativity."我们会谈到另一个作家And we'll talk about another author他对于我们如何克服这种完美主义who has very good advice for us of有非常好的建议 他叫Samuel Coleridgehow to overcome this perfectionism,Samuel Coleridge.80/20规则The 80/20 rule.这条规则 了解这条规则并将其应用在This rule- understanding this rule时间管理上改变了我在哈佛的学习经历as it applies to time management changed my Harvard experience.那帕累托法则是什么呢So what is the Pareto principle?帕累托是100年前的意大利经济学家Pareto was an Italian economist about 100 years ago.他得出了这样的法则And he came up with this principle并将其命名为帕累托法则which he named the Pareto principle.这法则表示 在大多数社会中And the principle says that in most societies,百分之二十的人拥有百分之八十的财富20 percent of the people own about 80 percent of the wealth.他们也将这条法则应用于商业组织They applied this principle to organizations as well,那就是你百分之二十的客户where 20 percent of your clients给你带来了百分之八十的收入generate 80 percent of your income.这也被用于经济学的许多领域And this has been applied to many areas in economics.而到最近 被用于时间管理方面And more recently,to time management.比如说 在我们百分之二十的时间里For example,in 20 percent of our time,我们可以完成百分之八十的工作we can get 80 percent of our work done.而当我明白这一点的时候And when I understood this,它改变了我对学术的态度it changed my approach toward my academics.为什么 因为我意识到Why? Because I realized that我不必将那些材料完全读完well I didn't need to read 100 percent of the material.再说一遍 这点别学我Again,don't quote me on this.我交论文前不必确认每一个t都写好了I didn't need to make sure that every t's crossed也不必确认每一个i上面都点了点and every i's dotted when I handed in the paper.我开始遵循更多的愉悦原则 或者说And I started to follow much more the pleasure principle快乐原则 于是我说or the happiness principle and I said,"好的 这才是我感兴趣的东西""OK,this is something that I really cared about."比如说 我不知道这门课还有没有For example,I don't know if this class is still offered now.文学与艺术学院课程 C14 "英雄"Lit and Arts C14 "Heroes".还能报名吗 这是我本科时候最喜欢的课程Still offered now? One of my favorite classes,as an undergrad.而且这课程还不算太难And it's not a very difficult class.我完全可以不怎么努力也得好成绩I could do very well without putting too much in it.但是我在这科的期末论文上花了50个小时But I spent a 50 hours on final paper.因为我写的主题是我非常关心的Because I wrote about a topic that I really really cared about.但是我没有得A 对我来说毫无道理And I didn't get an A for it,which didn't make any sense to me.但我仍然在上面下了大工夫But I still put in so much work in it.因为这实在是太有意思了 至于其它课程Because it was fun,whereas other classes that I enjoyed less,我只投入了能让我得到足够成绩的时间I put in what I needed in order to get what I thought was enough.不是要么全部要么没有Not all or nothing.不会说要么我就得A 要么我就不学习Either I study and get a straight A,or I don't study at all.另一门课Another class-我不知道这门课还有没有 还是文学与艺术I don't know if it's still taught- Lit and Arts again,Maria Tatar教的"神话故事" 她现在上别的课了"Fairy Tales"? With Maria Tatar? She teaches another class now.我本科时看见她第一眼就爱上了她I had a crush on her when I was an undergrad.我真不敢相信我就这么说出来了I can't believe that I just said it loud.(Laugh)那么 她拒绝了 其实我没有问她So yeah,she said no.Um no I didn't ask her.I didn't.也是在那门课上 不算太难的课So also in that class- not a very difficult class.在许多层次上来说非常享受的课A very enjoyable class on many levels.又一次 我花了许多时间在这篇And again,putting a lot of work into a paper that最终成为一篇以自尊为主题的there by the way ultimately began the to...专题论文之上became the topic of my dissertation on self-esteem.所以再一次问自己到底什么才是重要的So again,asking what is most important for me?除了要么没有要么全部外 我还在乎什么What do I really care about as opposed to saying all or nothing.我的成绩确实下降了一点点Now my grades did go down slightly as a result.但是只是很少一点点But really very little.因为我在应用这条20/80法则Because I was employing that 20/80 rule.将百分之二十的注意力放到重要的东西上20 percent of focus on what's important然后把百分之八十的工作做好and got the 80 percent of the work done.而我在学术的其它领域And I became so much more successful却获得了更多的成功in other areas of my academic career,839因为我有了更多的时间来打壁球because I had more time to play squash来享受壁球练习and enjoy my squash practice.我有了更多时间来和别人交流I had more time for socializing,有时间去坐在法学院里吃一次五点开始的for sitting in Law House and having a two and a half hour dinner,持续两个半小时的晚餐starting at 5 pm.就是在这样的基础上实现的Just based on that.另一个对于80/20的应用Another application of the 80/20 rule:我们每人在一天中都有不同的all of us have different time during the day最有工作效率的时间when we are most productive.实际上 在一天中百分之二十的时间内In fact,in 20 percent of the day,we get 80 percent,我们完成了百分之八十的工作potentially,80 percent of our work done,这取决于我们是早起的鸟还是夜猫子depending whether we are morning people or night people.有的人早上6点或7点就起来了There are people who get up in the morning at you know 6,7 am然后他们立刻就可以工作了and they are ready to go.我也是这样的 我很早起床 对我很简单That's me.I get up early.Very easy for me.我可以直接开电脑工作或去给孩子换尿布I just go straight to my computer or to change a diaper.很早的早上 直接去工作 没问题Very early in the morning.First thing.No problem.但是到了晚上9点10点 就完全不行了At night,by 9,10 pm,complete zombie.有人却是截然相反的And there are people who are the opposite-他们可以熬夜到凌晨2点 3点 4点can stay up till 2,3,4 am in the morning,那才是他们最有干劲的时候and that's when they are the freshest.00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:23,730这和我们内在的生物节奏有关By the way,it has to do with our internal biorhythm,和我们的生理节奏有关internal circadian rhythms.因为有人Because there are some people for whom-基本上没有人的周期是正好24小时的no one is exactly or very few people are exactly 24 hours rhythms大多数人都是23到25小时之间We are usually either somewhere between 23 and 25.对于周期是23小时的人来说So for people whose circadian rhythm is 23 hours,他们到了晚上就会非常疲劳they get very tired at night.但是他们早上却会精神抖擞地起来But then they wake up very fresh in the morning.那些周期是25小时的人Or people who are closer to 早上需要多睡一会need that extra sleep in the morning.就是因为那些人我才将这课调到11点半And it's for those people that I have this class at 11:30.我知道是很早但是感谢你们的到来I know it's early but thank you for making the effort.我上大学的时候 大多数人都学到很晚When I got to college,most students were studying late at night.我的室友就学到很晚 从晚上10点开始My roommates were studying late at night,starting at about 然后学到12点甚至凌晨2点and going to you know midnight or 2 am in the morning.这才是他们最有效率的时候 可我不是And that's when they are most productive.I wasn't.我宁愿早上早点起来And I would get up in the morning我在晚上会很累 根本无法集中精神and I was tired,exhausted,couldn't really focus at night.我听说了这样的效率时段后 我改变了作息And when I heard about this productive hour,I changed my day.我早早睡觉And I went to sleep early.在我的室友开始学习的时候 我上床睡觉So when my roommates started to study,I actually went to bed,然后在我的室友还在睡的时候起床and got up really early when my roommates were still asleep然后在早上早早地把工作完成and got my work done early in the morning,做完以后去上11点的课and then went to my 11 am class after I got my work done.在早上的那3个小时内And in 3 hours in the morning,我完成了更多东西 更有效率更有创造性I got much more done- more productive,more creative,比我在晚上熬夜有效率得多了much better retention than I did late at the night.我刚才说到的那两样东西These two things as I mentioned earlier真的改变了我在这里的经历really changed my experience here-在更短的时间内学到更多getting so much more in far less time.不是完美主义的方式 是追求卓越的方式Not the perfectionist approach,the pursuing excellence approach.大家都了解过"流动"了You read about "flow"-Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi谈论过流动Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi who talks about flow是我们最良好的感受 最出色的表现is being peak experience we enjoy the most and peak performance-也就是"没有付出就没有收获"we perform at our best,defying the "no pain,no gain" formula.我们什么时候感受到流动And when do we experience flow?我们焦虑的时候感受不到Not when we experience the high levels of anxiety就如完美主义者那样 我们无聊时感受不到as the perfectionist often does,not when we are bored,只有我们乐观愉快 兴奋的时候感受得到but when it's the optimum levels of arousal,when we are excited.追求卓越的人The person committed to excellence更容易感觉到流动is much more likely to experience the flow而那些一直畏惧失败的人than the person who is constantly afraid of failure,一直为失败所困扰的人constantly obsessed with failure,一直在设想如果我失败了怎么办的人constantly thinking about what if I fail.我来谈谈完美主义的根源吧Let me talk a little bit about the sources of the perfectionism.因为一旦我们明白 就如我上次说的Because if we understand that,as I mentioned last time,一旦我们明白它是怎么来的if we understand where it comes from,我们就更能克服它we are much more likely to be able to get over it.完美主义的根源So some of these sources of perfectionism.第一个 最重要的因素就是社会影响The first one,the most important one is conditioning.我们都不是天生的完美主义者I mean we are not born perfectionist.你们在录影带中看到的孩子 他们天生Children as you saw in the video- they are,as you know,比我们更能享受学习的过程born actually enjoying the learning process much more than we do.我们畏惧失败 他们却不断跌掉了又爬起When we are afraid of failing,they fall and they get up again.所以是社会的影响导致了So it's through conditioning that我们对于失败的畏惧 确切地说we learn to be afraid of failure,specifically,是这样一种在我们心中烙下的the schema that we internalize并且几乎从出生开始就不断被加深的基模that's being reinforced constantly from almost the time那就是 成果才是真正重要的when we were born- that what matters is the destination.当我们得到了某个成果的时候When we get to a certain destination比如学会走路 做得好such as learning how to walk- well done!在我第一年期末的时候得了A 真不错Such as getting A at the end of my first grade- terrific!只有我们的成果受到了奖励Gold star! It's the destination that's rewarded.过了没多久 我们就开始内化这种基模And after a while,we begin to internalize this schema并且我们也开始相信我们接受它and we begin to believe that we accept it当我们达成了某种成就的时候when we achieve a certain completion这样的事在我们的生活中一直延续着and goes on throughout our lives.我们什么时候会得到奖金I mean when do we get a bonus?在4月3号吗 当然不是 是在12月31号On April 3? No,we get it on December 31!或者说是圣诞节之前 年末Or just before Christmas at the end of the year.今年大家都干得不错 很好This was a good productive year.Well done.我们什么时候会得到分数When do we get the grades,还被别人轻拍后背表示做得不错the pats on the back if we did work well?是在学期末At the end of the semester.或是在考试后 我们完成了某些事的时候Or after an exam when we have completed something.不会在旅途中得到Not during the journey.换句话说 整个旅途都没有受到奖励In other words,the journey goes unrewarded.于是我们也就开始认为它是无关的And we begin to perceive it as inconsequential,是不重要的 只是到达终点的一种方式not important,just a means toward an end.只有非常少的教师 家长 组织Very few teachers,parents,organizations,还有学校会奖励旅途 奖励旅途中的愉快schools reward the journey- the enjoyment of the journey.当然 也有很少的人会奖励失败And of course,very few reward,lo and behold,failure,可这是旅途中不可避免的which is an inevitable part of every journey所以我们觉得这不好 这一点也不好so that we learn no good- this is no good-我们必须尽可能地追求直线we must have as much as possible a straight line.一种直接的基模A straight schema.我们内化它的时候也付出了代价And we pay a price for it when we internalize it.这就是我们出生所在的社会环境And this is the kind of social environment that we are born into,我们成长所在的社会环境that we are raised in,而这样的社会环境很难以改变and the social environment that is very difficult to change.我也知道 我家里也有孩子I mean I know- I have little kids at home.这太难以改变了It is so difficult to change it因为我自己也时常对孩子说并且专注于because very often I'm inclined to say to focus"Shirell学会走路了from early on the day "Oh Shirell just learned how to walk!做得好 你学会走路了"Well done! You know you just walk"而不是奖励其中所付出的努力as opposed to rewarding the effort as we'll talk about我们等会会讲到 奖励付出的努力in a minute and rewarding the hard work and甚至奖励失败 应对与整个过程rewarding even the failure,the trying,the coping,the process.非常难Very difficult.这当然也和准许为人有联系And that's connected,of course,to the permission to be human.准许看到人类本性的限制The permission for the constraint of view of the human nature,而不是理想化 孤立地as opposed to the idealized,disconnected,分离地看待生活detached of view of what life can look like.因为这不可能Because it can't.如果不是准许为人 而是要求完美的话Instead of permission to be human,there's pressure to be perfect压力是持久存在的It's constant.It's on-going.存在于媒体中 存在于工作中It's in the media.It's in the workplace.存在于教育机构中It's in our educational institutions.这无处不在 我们也为之付出了代价It's everywhere.And we pay a price for it.现在 我来给你们看几个例子Now let me give you some examples.在那前先给你们介绍一下Before I give this example,just a quick introduction.你们都知道 学术研究赚不了多少钱As you know,academics don't make that much money.进入学术圈的人 大多都不是为了钱When people go into academia,it's usually not for the money.有很多学者So many academics,我也不例外 必须额外赚取收入myself being known no exception have to supplement their income.我也有额外的收入So I supplement my income-而我希望和你们分享一下我额外做的事and I want to share with you something that I do on the side.我的眼镜掩饰了我有腹肌的事实(Laugh) Yeah.My glasses are just to hide the abs.Yeah.那么 他是真实的吗So I mean,is he real?这间房间里有谁是长这样的吗Is anyone in this room who looks like this?我也没指望你们来回答Yeah,didn't mean for you to answer that question.但我的意思是 他是真实的吗 部分真实的But I mean is this real? Well,partially.这照片修过不少地方A lot of it is photoshoped.但是没错 确实有人长是这样的But yeah,there are some people who look like this.但是我们在杂志会看到什么But what do we see in the magazines?我是说 如果你们进一家杂志店里面去I mean if you go to the magazine store.你们也知道这种杂志的 这些就是You know the magazines these are the kind of people封面上的人物who are on the cover.十分完美 完美的存在Perfect.Perfect beings.989甚至更加地Even more so-我们的Ken还有芭比娃娃都更加完美you know so we have our Kens- even more so with the Barbies.我在谷歌图片上找了好久 来看看吧I just do a lot of work on Google image.So look at this."科学的进步""The Progress of Science"."近代艺术的范例""Some Examples of Recent Art".就像今天的Cosmo杂志一样 不是么 看这个Just like Cosmo today,right? Well,so look at this."性爱女神的秘密""Sex Goddess Secrets".我是说 这甚至不是"性爱人类的秘密"I mean,it's not even "Sex HUMAN Secrets"!01:00:53,190 --> 01:00:54,510那还不够好That's not good enough!看看我们为自己定下的这些标准吧Look at these standards that are set for ourselves!我怎么才能变成那样 这里 我没看到How am I ever going to match that! Or here- oh I didn't see that."百分之三十的..."我应该好好读一读"The Naughty Thing 30%..." I should read that.(Laugh)但这不是我想指的But that's not what I want to point to.其实我想指这个"如何快速进步"I actually wanted to point to this- "How to Get Ahead Fast".要多快有多快 对吧 时间不多As fast as you can,right? There is no time.Or this- "Never"."永远不长痘痘"我都37岁了还有痘痘"Never Have a Zit Again".I mean,I still have zits.I'm 37.他们怎么做到的 又是不现实的模型What do...How do they do that?! Again,unrealistic models.1997年我还在新加坡住的时候You know in 1997 when I was living in Singapore,我想带Nathaniel Branden去新加坡I wanted to bring Nathaniel Branden to Singapore.他被认为是自尊研究的领头人Again,he is considered the leading person on self-esteem.他的妻子Devers Branden也在自尊His wife,Devers Branden has done a lot of work与自我成长方面花了很多功夫in the areas of self-esteem and personal growth.所以我希望能让他们来新加坡So I wanted to bring them both.所以我请他们来为我工作的公司So I brought them to consult for the organization做咨询where I was working.我在寻找其他途径And I was looking for other ways因为其他途径所要筹集的经费比较多because it was very expensive for other ways of funding that trip而我的一个好朋友And a close friend of mine,Pat Lee那时在为美体小铺工作Pat Lee was working at the time with the Body Shop.她说"这实在是太好了And she said,"you know,this is perfect.因为美体小铺还有Anita RoddickBecause the Body Shop this year and Anita Roddick我之前提过她 对于女性自尊也很感兴趣whom I mentioned earlier is interested in self-esteem for women.那为什么我们不能让Devers和NathanielSo why don't we do a project with Devers and Nathaniel还有美体小铺联合起来and the Body Shop joint venture在新加坡搞一次关于女性自尊的活动呢and have self-esteem for women in Singapore?"我认为这主意非常不错I thought it was a great idea.我和Anita Roddick见了面I actually met with Anita Roddick.然后我们共同赞助了Nathaniel BrandenAnd we co-sponsored Nathaniel Branden-后来这次活动非常成功it was a highly successful event.本来有700个座位 可来了1000多人We had 700 seats; over 1000 people came.我们得在场外放置等离子大屏幕We had to have plasma outside.还有 这次活动对很多人产生了激励And in addition,it made a huge stir并激发了一场运动 或者说是小规模运动and really started a movement or a mini movement在新加坡的 女性自尊的运动in Singapore- self-esteem for women.作为结果As a result,Nathaniel Branden写了本书 叫"女性的自尊"Nathaniel Branden wrote a book,called "Self-esteem For Women".因为他被我们在研讨会上所讲述的Cause he's blown away with the fascinating stories那些故事给深深吸引了that were told in the seminar and so on.不管怎么说 Anita Roddick在女性和自尊方面Anyway,but Anita Roddick has done a lot of work做了不少工作for women and self-esteem.其中一个项目 她在1997年策划的And one of the projects- she did that in 1997-我觉得你们大多都太年轻了 可能不知道I think you were,most of you were too young to be aware of it,但是所有美体小铺的分店都有一个but it was on all Body Shop stores was one叫做Ruby的洋娃娃 用来取代芭比娃娃that she based on a doll called Ruby,the alternative to Barbie.然后那次活动是这样的And here is what the campaign looked like.抱歉Whoops! Sorry."有三十亿女人长得不像超级模特"There are 3 billion women who don't look like supermodels只有8个才像"and only 8 who do."或者"媒体们Or "Hey media,在我们家乡 文化与生理的多样才是标准Where we come from cultural and physical diversity is the norm.那里就是地球"It's called Planet earth."这次活动非常成功 也很重要Very effective campaign.And so important.因为我们今天文化中的Because what of the models that模型就是这样的 要么全部要么没有we have today in our culture- all or nothing.这些照片是一同被找到的I mean,this picture by the way came together.我没把它们特意放在一起I didn't put them together.要么你大吃大喝 要么就不吃不喝Either you binge,or the alternative.我们从电影中得到了什么Or what do we get in the movies?谁能达到《壮志凌云》里面的标准I mean who possibly can live up to the standards of Top Gun?汤姆克鲁斯和凯莉麦吉利斯Tom Cruise and Kelly McGillis.他们拥有的那种完美的爱情The perfect love that they had there,但这是我们所有的模型but this is the model that we had-等我们谈到恋爱关系的时候会讲到and I'll talk about it when I talk about relationships.谁又能度过《爱你九周半》那样的九周半呢Who possibly can sustain even for "9 1/2 Weeks" (movie),更不要说过一辈子了 那电影里的激情let alone a life time? The passion in the movies.都是不可能的标准 还有那些自助的书Impossible standards.Also,self-help books.比如《思考致富》"Think and Grow Rich".和这个没什么关系 只要思考 就能致富Nothing much about this.No,just think.And then you'll be rich.这本书卖了几百万本Tens of millions of copies sold from this book.这里还有一本书Or here is another book that I found.这本书或许不错Now the book,the book may be great.我得承认我还没有读过I haven't read it- I have to admit.但先看看 《小步迈向幸福 现在》But look at it- "Small Steps to Big Happiness.NOW!"1072我们又迫不及待了 说的是专注于目标Again,we can't wait.It's about the destination.而不是专注于努力 旅途 人格It's not about the hard work,the journey,the character,还有所需的改变change that needs to take place.还有别的And there is something else.还有别的导致完美主义的因素There is something else that leads to perfectionism.这是一个你们已经读到过的研究结果And this is the research that you have already read about.这是由Carol Dweck完成的出色研究And this is work done by,great work done by Carol Dweck,她现在在斯坦福大学工作who is now at Stanford.这就是她的研究成果Here is her study.因为Because you see,她所描述的是 不是所有的赞美都是好的what she illustrates is that not all praise is good.对一个孩子说 你很棒 你很出色Telling a kid you are wonderful,you are terrific,you are great,不吝赞美之词no matter what indiscriminately-你太聪明了 你真是惊人 我的小爱因斯坦you are so smart,you are so amazing,my little Einstein-这也不总是好的that's not always good.长期来看这可能也是有害的That may be harmful in the long run.这也会导致完美主义的基模And it may,it may create the perfectionism schema.那么我和你们分享一下她的研究成果吧So let me share with you one of her studies.我想你们已经读过了And again,I think you've already read this.她所做的就是找到一些十岁的孩子So what she did was going to group of 10 years old然后把他们随机分成两组and randomly divided them into two groups.第一组孩子都做了道题The first group did a puzzle他们都每个人独立完成了which they completed successfully,each one individually.到最后 对每一个完成的孩子And at the end,for each one when he or she completed the puzzle,她都说"你真聪明伶俐"she would say,"wow.You are so intelligent.So smart."当然 孩子们都感觉不错And of course,they felt good about it.Terrific.第二组做的是同一道题 做完了 做的不错The second group did the exact same puzzle- succeeded; did well.结束后 她说And at the end of it,she said,"你真努力 你很认真""wow.You put so much effort into it.You worked so hard."这随机分成的两组孩子Again,randomly divided into these two groups.一组是"聪明伶俐" 一组是"努力认真"One- "smart and intelligent"; one- "effort,hard work".然后她开始第二部分的研究And she had a second part of the study.第二部分That second part:两组孩子要选两道题the participant had to choose between two puzzles.他们被告知其中一道很简单One puzzle they were told was relatively easy-他们可以很好地完成one they could do well.另一道非常之困难The other one was extremely hard,但是他们能够从中学到许多but they could really learn a lot from it.那组被称赞From the group that was told that聪明伶俐的孩子里they were smart or smart and intelligent,五成孩子选了简单的题目50 percent chose the easy one;五成孩子选择了可以学到很多的难题50 percent chose the hard one where they could learn a lot.那组被称赞努力认真的孩子里From the group that was told that they were hard-working,九成孩子选择了that they put in a lot of effort,90 percent chose the hard one,他们能学到很多的难题the one that they could learn from.这就是研究的第二部分This was the part two of the study.第三部分Part three.这次她让孩子们做She brought them in again,and this time had them take,一道非常难的题or do a puzzle which was very difficult,这题基本上是无法解答的which was essentially unsolvable.她想看看两组孩子的反应And she wanted to see the reaction of the two groups.被告知他们很聪明The group that was told how smart they were,很伶俐的那一组how intelligent they were,他们没有坚持多久that group didn't persist much并且非常沮丧and experienced a lot of frustration并且很快就开始放弃了and would give up very quickly on that puzzle.与此相反 被告知努力认真的In contrast,the group that was told earlier that那一组孩子they worked hard and that they put in a lot of effort,他们更能坚持并且享受解题的过程persisted much more and actually enjoyed the process,即使到最后他们都没能解开这道题even though they didn't end up solving the puzzle.但是他们享受这个过程 并且更加努力But they enjoyed the process and they worked harder.看看这微小的操纵带来的结果Look at this slight manipulation.简简单单的一个句子"你真聪明"Simply one sentence- "oh you are so smart!""你真努力""Oh you are working so hard!"一句话带来了这么明显的不同One sentence lead to this significant difference.用她的话来说 "重视努力让孩子拥有In her words- "Emphasizing effort gives a child a variable一个他自己能掌控的变量that they can control.这能让他们认为自己能掌控自己的成功They come to see themselves as in control of their success.强调自然的天赋Emphasizing natural intelligence让孩子们无法掌控成功takes it out of the child’s control,这不会给孩子提供面对失败的方法and it provides no good recipe for responding to a failure."事实上当你仅仅注重于天赋的时候Essentially what happens when you focus only on the intelligence,你就是在制造完美主义的基模on how smart you are,you are creating the perfectionist schema,而不是专注于as opposed to a schema that旅途当中 努力的基模focuses on the journey,effort,hard work.她继续说道She continues-"如果你称赞孩子的智力 当他们失败时"When you praise kids' in telligence and then they fail,他们会认为自己不再聪明they think they're not smart anymore,然后失去对于眼前工作的兴趣and they lose interest in their work.相反 那些被称赞努力的孩子In contrast,kids praised for effort show no impairment在困难面前不会气馁 甚至更有动力and often are energized in the face of difficulty."这两种方式造成了多么明显的不同What a difference just based on these two approaches.被称赞智力的人会产生这样的基模Person who is praised for their intelligence creates this schema-要么我很聪明 要么我就不聪明either I'm intelligent or I'm not.我很畏惧不聪明And I'm afraid of not being intelligent,所以我就选择容易一点的任务吧so I'll choose the easier task.当我无法做到的时候 这就是攻击And when I can't do something,it's an attack,是对于我的基模的侮辱 没错吧it's an insult on my schema,right?这是对于直线的偏离It's a deviation from this straight narrow.相对的 如果努力才是最重要的In contrast,if effort is most important,"好的 让我试试看吧""OK,let me see what's around the corner here.""我学到了很多 这真有意思""Hey I'm learning a lot now.This is wonderful.This is fun."因为 一个是"既定思维模式"如Dweck所说Because with one,it's "a fixed mindset",in Dweck's words.而另一个And in the other,是种可拓展的 时刻改变和发展的思维模式it's the malleable,changing,ongoing,developing mindset.一个是 畏惧失败 因为我想聪明One- there is fear of failure,cause I want to be smart.被人称赞聪明很有意思It's fun being called smart and intelligent.我不想威胁到这个基模I don't want to threaten the schema.相对的是 努力的 重视过程的Versus working hard,focusing on the process,当追求卓越的基模when the excellence schema成为惯常做法becomes the dominant modus operandi.OK.那么我们如何克服完美主义呢So how do we overcome perfectionism?如果我们确实有这个问题怎么办What do we do about it if we have it?要记住 根本就没有完美的完美主义者And again,remember there's no perfect perfectionist.也没有完美的追求卓越者There is no perfect person committed to excellence.你们必须选择你能快乐的生活方式You need to choose in your life where you are happy,选择你认为能够更加快乐的生活方式and where you think you can be happier.不会有现成的答案摆在你面前This may not even speak to you.对你而言可能只是有趣的学术理论This for you may be just interesting academically,或者是非常个人化的原因or it may be deeply personal.那么我们该怎么更多地采用卓越的基模呢So how do we become more and more of the excellence schema?首先 是自我认知 在于自我了解First,it is about self-awareness.It's about understanding.对我来说 明白 "我太过于有自卫性了For me,a big breakthrough was understanding我不想再这样了"是一个大突破"hey I'm actually defensive and I don't want to be defensive."因为我知道这会伤害亲密的人际关系Because I know that it hurts intimacy and relationships并且从那时候我开始在这上面努力and that's when I started the real work on it.并且有所进步And that has improved,并且在将来仍将继续提升我的人际关系and continues to improve my relationships.或者"看看我有多么畏惧失败Or "look at my reaction to failure.我有多么害怕听到个不字Look how afraid I am of hearing a no.看看我有多么害怕被拒绝Look how afraid I am of being rejected.看看我有多害怕应对与尝试"Look how afraid I am of coping and trying."就应该意识到它So being aware of it.如果你想让你的网球技术进步I mean,if you want to improve your forehand in tennis,你必须首先明白你想要进步的是什么you first need to be aware of what it is that you want to improve这就是第一步 说起来容易做起来难So that's the first step.And that's easier said than done.我来给你们介绍一个简短的例子Let me show you a quick example of someone是关于一个不完全了解自己的弱点的人的who perhaps is not fully aware of her weaknesses.视频：威尔和格蕾丝 第三季第十集[Video: Will and Grace S3EP10]你好 Jackie BrownKAREN: Hey,Jackie Brown.为什么没有咖啡了JACK: Why isn't there any coffee?!和你没有老婆和三个孩子的原因相同KAREN: Same reason why you don't have a wife
