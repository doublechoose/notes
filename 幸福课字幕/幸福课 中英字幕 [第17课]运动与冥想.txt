What about interval training?"快跑 休息 再快跑 再休息So sprints and stop.Sprints and stop.这种是划艇队经常做的训练Something that you know the crew team does often,运动员经常做的训练athletes do often.这些运动行不行?What about this form?我上节课没有专门提出The reason why I didn't bring it up explicitly in the lecture is是因为目前对其他的运动还没有定论because the jury is still out on the different forms of exercise.我可以告诉大家But let me tell you目前在研究中发现的一些趋势what are some of the trends that we see in research.目前看来Right now it seems that如果你只能做一种运动if there's only one form of exercise that you do,那么最佳选择the best bank for the buck,时间最花得其所的是有氧运动best value for your time would be aerobic exercise.理想地每周三四次半小时的有氧运动3,ideally 4 times,30 minutes of aerobic exercise a week.这是最低要求That's at minimum.但是However,however,如果你还能做举重训练以补充if you can also do weight training and supplement the physic...有氧运动 那也很好the aerobic exercise,that's terrific.That's great.一周两三次举动训练非常好Twice a week,3 times of weight training is great,尤其是年纪大了以后especially as you get older.举重训练更加有用That...Weight training contributes more.但在年轻时 举重训练也很好But also at a very young age,weight training is good.但是 它不能代替有氧运动However,it is not a replacement for aerobic exercise.研究发现它改善心理健康的效果It hasn't shown to have the same psychological effect不如有氧运动as aerobic exercise does.另外一种运动 在经过研究后…The other form of exercise and it has been studied-我要重申 这些都是初步结果again these are all tentative results;有人对这种运动做过初步研究there've been pilot studies about it.最后结果The ends,因为样本不足 暂时无法下确切结论the sample sizes are not large enough yet to say definitively,但我们可以确切地说有氧运动just like we can say about aerobic exercise,产生的效果能媲美it has similar effect一些强效精神病药物to some of our most powerful psychiatric drugs.这个结论是确切的 有大量研究来支持That's definitive- there are tons of studies on it包括Babyak2000年以来的研究 以及之前的ever since Babyak in 2000 as well as before.另一种开始被研究的运动But another form of exercise that has begun to be studied得出可喜的结果 那就是间歇运动with some very promising results is interval training.间歇运动就是 以跑步为例子Interval training would be,say,running at,达到最大心率的90%到95%between 90 and 95 percent of your maximum heart rate.如果你20岁 你最大心率就是So if you are 20,your maximum heart rate would be,would be 200,计算公式是220减去年龄because it's 220 minus your age.所以你跑步的心率要达到180到Then you need to be running at around at 180 to 190 pulse rate,强度非常高which is hard,which is tough,不能持续很长时间which you can't do for a very long time.但如果能持续30秒到一分钟But doing it for as little as 30 seconds up to a minute然后休息and then resting,让你的心率下降到最大心率的60%letting your heart rate go back down to 60 percent也就是120 然后重复这个间歇运动of its maximum say 120,and then doing another interval.有初步研究表明这种运动That has been shown with pilot studies only能产生显著效果to have remarkable effects.通常效果甚至比单纯做有氧运动更大In fact,often more powerful than aerobic exercise on its own,而且持续时间更长and lasts for even longer- the effect.所以 再说回来So- again,我没有在课堂上正式介绍这种运动I did not introduce it officially as part of the class,但很多同学问起 所以现在介绍一下but since many of you asked,I am introducing it.因为我只想给大家介绍Because I want to introduce you only things那些有确切结论的运动that are with very robust results.John Ratey也谈过这种运动John Ratey talks about this.我等一下会讲John RateyAnd I'll talk a little bit about John Ratey in a minute.他是哈佛医学院的精神医生He's the Harvard Medical psychatrist可以说他是一个前沿的倡导者who is probably the leading proponent in research在研究运动和精神健康这个领域in the area of exercise and mental health.他本身…虽然目前的结果是初步的And he himself- even though the results are still tentative,但他一周会做两次间歇运动he introduces two interval trainings a week.除了一周做六天运动以外So in addition to working out six days a week,其中两天还会做全速短跑 休息two of them include full out sprinting,rest,全速短跑 休息full out sprinting,rest.研究表明即使没有做够30分钟And what they've shown was that even less time than 30 minutes,但还能得到同等的效果you can get the same effect,同等的甚至更好的心理效果the same psychological effect and even better.我一周也会做两次间歇运动What I do twice a week: I introduce interval training.所以 举个例子So for example,今天早上我在蹦床上跳了30分钟this morning when I was on my trampoline,I did it for 30 minutes.在这30分钟里 我还做了4个短跑And out of the 30 minutes,there were 4 sprints.没错Indeed.(Laughter)你们不相信我会跳蹦床 是吧?You don't believe that I do trampoline,do you?我下次拍下来 还是不要了I'll videotape it and I'll...Maybe not.Maybe not.4次短跑 我戴着心率监测仪So 4 sessions of sprints,and I have my heart monitor on,快速跑一段 我的心率大约是going all way- for me it's about 165 heart rate,165到170之间 然后休息 下降到between 165 and 170,and then resting,going back to about 110,少于我最大心率的60%which is less than 60 percent of my maximum,如此重复四次and then doing it four times.这30分钟里其余的时间And for the rest of the 30 minutes,我只做缓和的有氧运动I just do moderate aerobic exercise.所以我也做间歇运动So I also introduce the interval training.举重训练就比较少做 因为我做瑜伽时The weight training I do less of,because I get that from Yoga-就有这种加强体能的效果a lot of the strengthening exercises.但最重要的一点是The most important thing though that我想说 间歇运动I do want to say about interval training特别是对于完美主义者来说is that, especially for perfectionists,很容易导致训练过度it's very easy to over-train.大家最好不要达到最大心率You don't want to get to your maximum heart rate并且持续一段长时间 即使你做得来and keep it there for a long time,even if you can.更多并不意味着更好More does not necessarily mean better.再说一次 除非你是备战奥运Again,unless you are training for Olympics,这种情况下有时你就要达到in which case you do want to get to100%的最高心率100 percent of your maximum heart rate at times,想练出最健康的身体 达到90%…for maximum health you want to get to 90 percent,最大心率的95%就行了maximum 95 percent of your maximum heart rate,所以戴上心率监测仪就很有用which is why a heart rate monitor can help so much.因为它能告诉你 运动是否强度太大Because it can tell you when you are working too hard或者强度不足or when it's too easy.总之 换换花样有助于运动Bottom line: variety is good for exercise.你可以跳舞 这也是好运动If you can introduce dancing,it's great exercise.你可以 偶尔去健身室健身If you can introduce,once in a while working in the gym,偶尔打篮球once in a while playing basketball,划艇 花样越多越好rowing- the more variety,the better.只要保证 至少对我们来说 一周四次But the foundation: at least we,ideally 4 times a week,一次30分钟的有氧运动30 minutes of aerobic exercise.上节课我们讲到克服障碍So we stopped last time with overcoming barriers.其中一些障碍包括And some of the barriers are that伴随运动而来的疼痛 使运动更难了it's difficult there are some pain associated with it,即使你只达到最大心率的70%even if you are at 70 percent of your heart rate.运动引起不适It's still uncomfortable.克服不适的最简单方法就是进入状态And ways to deal with it is at least as you get into it,因为通常我们跑步进入一种状态后cause very often we enter the zone when we start to run,我们就感受不到不适了we don't feel the difficulty any more.但必须开了头才行But at least the beginning is important.找别人来支持你克服困难 慢慢适应Have social support to divide and conquer,to build gradually,用一些东西分散注意力 例如电视 MPand to have distracters,such as TV,and your MP3,能分散注意力就行了and whatever it is.另一个障碍Another barrier- and this one is,很不幸 这个障碍在校园很普遍unfortunately very common here on campus,那就是我们没有时间is just we don't have time.大家知道 在高中You know in high school,我经常去高中演讲I do give a lot of talks in high schools,and我注意到的其中一件事是 通常one of the things that I see there is that students generally,很多高中要求学生参加团队活动in many high schools actually have to be part of a team.他们除了体育课做运动以外They have to,in addition to doing physical exercise,PE,还要参加团队活动they also have to be part of a team.所以他们运动得更多 虽然还是不够So they get not enough,but more exercise,但是我们读大学第一件放弃的事whereas one of the first things that go in college,尤其是那些不参加团队活动的学生especially or only for students who do not play on the team,我们放弃的第一件事是运动one of the first things that go is exercise.我没有时间 我有很多事要做I don't have time.I have so many things that I want to do.大学是一个新世界It's a new world.在考试期间 大家也首先就放弃运动Well,it's also the first things that goes during exam period,因为我压力太大了because I'm so stressed.我有太多事要做了I have so many things to do.其实 最不能放弃的是运动Well,it should be the last thing to go.最不能放弃的是运动It should be the last thing to go.为什么?因为它是一项投资Why? Because it is an investment.虽然你失去了45分钟You may be losing the 45 minutes.你知道You know,运动30分钟 之后洗个澡　我推荐大家这么做working out for 30 minutes and showering after which I recommend.虽然你失去了45分钟You may lose that 45 minutes.但你获得了更多 这时间花得其所But you'll gain so much more.It's such a good investment.为什么?因为做运动 记忆力提高Why? Because your memory actually gets better when you exercise.所以你更能充分利用学习时间So you'll get more buck for the bank in terms of time you study;你的创造力提高了 精神更集中your creativity levels go up; your concentration,不管你是否有多动症 有就更要运动了whether you have ADD or not,especially if you have或者你有患多动症的趋势or you have a tendency toward ADD or ADHD,即使对于没有多动症的人来说but even for people without it,运动也能大大提高注意力集中concentration goes up significantly.活力显著提高 所以这时间花得其所Energy levels go up significantly.So it's a very good investment.大家还记得我讲过Remember I told you the story壁球赛季末我停止运动的事吗?when I stopped exercising at the end of the squash season?突然我觉得我有了很多时间And suddenly I said,"oh I have so much time."但我完成的工作反而少了And I ended up getting so much less done.第一因为我的生活规律打乱了A,because I don't have the rituals;第二因为我注意力没那么集中了and B,because I wasn't as focused,我创造力下降了 活力下降了I wasn't as creative,I wasn't as energized.最不能放弃的是运动It should be the last thing to go,especially,尤其是在考试期间这种压力大的时候especially during a stressful period such as exam period.克服时间不足这个问题One way to overcome the time commitment again不能靠自律is not relying on self-discipline.我们之前已经讲过了We have established that before;我们看过那个研究 人的自律是有限的we saw the research- we have a limited amount of self-discipline.我们要自己形成规律Create rituals where,例如一周中有三个早上做运动say,3 mornings during the week you'll do it;如果下午晚上才有空 那也行or if a good time for you is the afternoon or evening,形成一个时间规律but have a ritual around it.另一个阻碍定期运动的障碍Another barrier to exercising regularly-是一个有趣但经常被忽视的障碍this is an interesting one and often overlooked这个障碍非常强大 潜意识障碍but extremely powerful- and that is the subconscious barrier.Nathaniel Branden谈过这点Nathaniel Branden talks about this我在我的书中也略谈过 引用了他的话and I talked about it a little bit in my book,quoting him.他谈到自尊He talks about self-esteem and自尊隐含了一个概念:我们值得拥有幸福part of self-esteem is the notion that we are worthy of happiness值得拥有幸福The notion of being worthy of happiness.当你问别人"你值得拥有幸福吗?"And when you ask people,"are you worthy of happiness?"大部人会说"值得" 但在潜意识中Most people would say,"yes." But if you ask the subconscious,通常很多人都会说"不值得"very often,for many people,it's "no",可能因为脑袋里有一把声音说"不值得"whether it's because of the voice that we heard in the past因为过去老师 教育工作者 父母 重要的大人from teachers,educators,parents,significant adults,社会大众都要我们向不现实的榜样看齐society at large by comparing us to unrealistic models.所以通常在我们潜意识里有一把声音说But very often we have this voice,the subconscious level that"我不值得拥有幸福""we are not really worthy of happiness".这是一个障碍 使我们无法更快乐And that is a barrier; that stops us from becoming happier.我们知道运动的其中一个作用就是Now one of the things that we know of exercise is that可以说它是让我们变幸福的最强效药物it's one of the- if not the most power drug for making us happier我知道运动使人幸福 使人感觉良好Now I know that exercise makes me happier; it makes me feel good.但如果我的潜意识认为But if my subconscious thinks that我不值得拥有这些感觉 不值得幸福I'm unworthy of these feelings,unworthy of being happy,它可能阻止我运动it may in fact stop me from exercising.为什么?因为 大家回忆一下Why? Because remember,意识不喜欢mind doesn't like when there is an inconsistency潜意识与外界不一致between what's inside and what's outside.如果我潜意识认为"不应该快乐"And if what's inside is saying "shouldn't be happy"我就会听从我的潜意识then I try to match it to what's inside.我就不会运动And I don't exercise.因为我运动的话 就会与潜意识不一致Because if I do exercise,then there will be a disconnect-我会比潜意识认为的更幸福I'll be happier than I think I'm worthy of.在这个问题上有过很多研究There's a lot of research on this.例如 心理学家Bill SwannFor example,by psychologist Bill Swann,讲过自我确认理论who talks about self-confirmation theory,这是我们意识里一股很强大的力量which is a very powerful force within us.我们意识里有自我提高There's a self-enhancement,我们想在别人和自己眼里表现出好的一面that we want to appear good in other people's eyes,in our eyes,但还有一股反作用力 就是自我确认but there is a counter-force,which is self-confirmation我们想确认对自己的了解是否属实where we want to confirm whatever we think about ourselves.如果我们认为自己不值得幸福And if we think we are not worthy of happiness,通常我们就不会做让自己幸福的事we very often not do things that actually make us happy.在其他方面也存在 例如在恋情中We see it in other areas- in relationships,for example.如果我认为我不值得拥有好伴侣If I think I'm unworthy of a wonderful partner,不值得在恋情中得到幸福of being happy in relationships,通常我就会在潜意识里very often I'll often inadvertently subconscious working here,破坏这段恋情jeopardize the relationship积极寻找恋情中不顺利的地方and look for things that are not working,actively,潜意识中寻找方法伤害这段恋情subconsciously look for ways of hurting the relationship.所以我们需要注意这些潜意识力量So we need to be aware of the subconscious level.通常它能影响我们会不会去做运动And very much it applies to whether or not we exercise.我们该拿它怎么办?最好的办法就是运动So what do we do with this? A best thing to do is to just do it.再一次说回来 把它规律化Again,ritualize it.不要分析太多 尽管去运动就行了Not analyze it too much.Just go ahead and exercise.你知道一周三四次运动对你有益 尽管去做You know 3,4 times a week is good for you,just do it.再一次说到 即想即做法And again it's the five-minute take-off that潜意识会告诉你subconscious mind will try to tell you,"不要做 你没时间 还有别的事要做"don't do it.You don't have the time.There are other things.你明天再做 你下周再开始定期运动"You'll do it tomorrow.Next week you'll start the regime."为了达到目的 潜意识会很聪明地The subconscious mind is very smart in its attempt,and用尽各种方法 几乎能使你的行动听从潜意识will do anything that it can almost to create this congruency.当你出去运动时 你就让自己看到When you go out and exercise and you show yourself,"是的 我值得拥有幸福""yes I'm worthy of happiness."通常潜意识就会听从这个想法Very often the subconscious mind will follow suit.所以尽管去运动So just do it.第二个是认识 这是认知层面的The second thing is recognize.This is on the cognitive level.认识运动的重要性Recognize how important physical exercise is.大家回忆Martin Seligman说的"大部分人都专注于脖子以上"Remember what Martin Seligman said,"we mostly focus on neck up"-心理学家是这样and we do it as psychologists,学术机构里的学生是这样we do it as students in academic institution,尤其是在这样的学校里especially in a place like this.大过专注于思考和认知So much about thinking and cognition.你们也正因此才能考上哈佛 才能成功That's how you got here.That's how you were successful.但专注于脖子以下 也同样重要But it's no less important to think about neck down.事实上 要获得幸福 脑袋的作用In fact,the mind alone can only take us so far是有限的 所以我要告诉大家when it comes to happiness,which is why I told you如果我是心理医生 我治人的第一件事就是if I were a therapist,a pre-requisite for me to treat people要求他们运动would be to have them exercise regularly.因为我不想违抗自然Because I don't want to fight nature.我想借助自然的力量来治人I want to work with nature and build on it.很大程度上 运动Exercise in many ways是心理治疗中的"无名英雄"is the "unsung hero" of the psychological interventions.它在很多方面都发挥了作用It helps on so many levels.John Ratey 刚才提过他John Ratey- mentioned him;哈佛医学院教授 精神病医生 "某种程度上Harvard Medical School professor,psychiatrist: "In a way,它能对付焦虑症 恐慌症 普通的压力It works on anxiety,on panic disorder,and on stress in general,压力和抑郁症有莫大关联which has a lot to do with depression.运动能释放神经递质And it generates the release of neurotransmitters-去甲肾上腺素 血清素 多巴胺norepinephrine,serotonin,and dopamine-这些物质与重要精神类药物相似that are very similar to our most important psychiatric medicines做一轮运动就像吃了一点百忧解Having a bout of exercise is like taking a little bit of Prozac一点利他林 针对性很强"and a little bit of Ritalin,right where it is supposed to go."正确的分量 正确的身体部位The exact right amount of it.The exact right location.没有副作用And without side effects,也有副作用 积极的副作用or with side effects- positive side effects,身体 精神 和情绪的副作用physical as well as mental and emotional side effects.John Ratey在他的一本很棒的书中呼吁What John Ratey is calling for in his wonderful,wonderful book-这本书今年一月份刚刚出版just came out recently in this January-他呼吁发起运动革命what he calls for is an exercise revolution.对于这个呼吁And he backs up this他用了大量科学证据来证明它的重要性call with a lot of scientific evidence of why it is so important.我给大家讲他谈到的一个方面Let me show you just one area that he talks about.他谈到各种年龄层He talks about all ages.孩子 成年人 还有老人He talks about kids,adults,as well as the elderly population.运动对每个年龄层都有积极作用 从0到120岁And it has positive effects for every age,from 0 to 120.我给大家讲几个研究和发现Let me talk about a couple of studies and findings这些研究是在学校推广运动that were implement-that exercise was implemented in schools.有几间学校实行把运动So there are a few schools that introduce physical exercise作为一门必修课程as an integral part of the curriculum.00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,750例如 这个方法已经有几间学校效仿了For example,and this is,has been replicated in a few schools-每天早上 做45分钟的运动every morning,45 minutes of some form of exercise-通常是跑步 有时划船 骑自行车 爬山usually running,sometimes rowing,cycling,climbing.新泽西州有一间学校There is a school in New Jersey甚至在运动场安装了一面攀爬墙that actually put a climbing wall where students exercised.一些有氧运动But some form of the aerobic exercise,有时换换花样 做间歇运动sometimes intertwined with interval training.每天早上在上课前 45分钟运动Every morning,before school,45 minutes a day.有些学校安排在上午以后Some of the schools had it later during the day;大部分学校安排在早上most of them in the mornings.这里就是其中一些学校得到的成效Here are some of the results from some of the schools那些推行运动的学校that actually introduced it:肥胖水平下降 这是意料之内的obesity levels,not surprising,went down.例如在伊利诺斯州的Naperville区For example in Naperville in Illinois,in the district那里的学校推广运动there where physical exercise was introduced in school,-这种做法很有趣 因为大部分学校which is by the way interesting because in most schools...昨天我在Horace Mann演讲Just yesterday I gave a talk at Horace Mann那里的老师告诉我and the teachers told me that纽约很多学校in many of these schools in New York,都取消运动训练了physical exercise has been taken out而不是提倡做更多运动rather than more of it is introduces-运动训练和艺术课都取消了physical exercise and art both taken out.为什么?为了考高分 专注于脖子以上Why? Because they have to get the grades- neck up.这样很可悲 他们因此付出了代价And that's a pity.And they pay a price.Naperville的学校的肥胖水平下降So obesity in a school in Naperville或者说伊利诺斯州的Naperville区or in the district of Naperville in Illinois,肥胖水平下降obesity levels went down在学生中 从30%降到3%from 30 percent to 3 percent among the students.这不仅对学生目前的生活有影响That has repercussions not just for the students lives there-他们身体更舒服了 心情更快乐了that they are more comfortable,that they are happier;对他们以后的生活也有影响it has repercussions and consequences for the rest of their lives.他们不再那么易于They are much less susceptible患上慢性疾病 例如癌症 心脏病and prone to the chronic illnesses such as cancer,heart failure.从很多方面来看都是双赢的It's a win-win on so many level.患糖尿病的可能性也降低了Much less susceptible to diabetics.这是肥胖症方面的效果So that's obesity.他们在Naperville区还发现了What they also find in Naperville is that分数大大的提高了the grades went up significantly.其实美国学生通常In fact,usually the US doesn't do very well,在国际测试中表现并不是很出色doesn't do very well when it comes to those international tests,八年级考的那些数学和科学考试maths and science tests that they do I think usually at 8th grade但Naperville是一个例外Well,Naperville is an exception.他们的数学成绩全世界排16名They scored No.16 in the world in mathematics科学成绩全世界排第一名and No.1 in the world in science.有些人会反驳说Now people argue thatNaperville是一个富人区 确实如此Naperville is an affluent neighborhood or district and it's true.那其他地方呢?How about other places?一些很穷的内陆城市也推行了运动Well they introduced exercise in very poor areas,in inner cities例如For example,宾夕法尼亚州Titusville 很多人都低于in Titusville,Pennsylvania,where many people are way below,平均工资远远低于这个州的平均工资the average is way below the average income for the state.在推行运动之前 学校的教学成绩When before they introduced the exercise,school performance-远远低于州的平均水平they were significantly below state average,宾夕法尼亚州的平均水平Pennsylvania's average.推行运动一年后After introducing exercise within a year,成绩比州平均水平高17%they went up to 17 percent above state average.当年学校唯一的变化With the only change being there in that year-就是推行了运动训练introducing physical exercise.其他地区的学校也发现同样现象They've seen this in other schools in other districts as well.同时还发现在Titusville那所学校And what they also saw in the same school,他们发现 例如打架斗殴in Titusville,that fist fights,for example they noticed,因为推行运动训练 暴力完全消失violence disappeared completely as a result of the exercise,而在爱荷华州一间学校也发现while they found also in a school in Iowa在推行运动训练后where they introduced physical exercise,一年内纪律问题从225宗降到95宗disciplinary problems went down from 225 to 95 in one year.在另一间堪萨斯州学校里 也是内陆城市In another school in Kansas,also inner city,纪律问题下降了67%disciplinary problems went down by 67 percent这些都是在推行了运动训练以后after they introduced exercise.暴力变少了 运动使我们平静We are much less likely to be violent; it calms us;使我们的身体处于自然状态it brings us to our natural state of being,这种状态更为平静 而不是苦闷愤怒which is much calmer as opposed to being angry and upset.人们需要释放那股怒气And people need to let out that steam.很不幸的是 通常Unfortunately very often人们都通过打架斗殴来释放that steam is let out in fights with aggression.用运动将它转换成健康的活力更加有益身心And this is a much healthier way to divert that healthy energy.我给大家看一段我最喜欢的一部电影Let me show you a clip from one of my favorite movies,《律政俏佳人》Legally Blonde.在这个镜头里And it's the part where一个女人刚刚被控谋杀亲夫a woman is just being charged with the murder of her husband.And我们的法学院校友瑞茜·威瑟斯彭为她辩护our very own law school graduate Reese Witherspoon defends her.糟了 我找找看 谢谢Whoops! Let me get to it.Thank you.视频 律政 找到了Videos.Legally...Here it is.(律政俏佳人片段)[VIDEO- Clip from "Legally Blonde"]我们要为Brooke Windham辩护 她的有钱丈夫We're defending Brooke Windham,whose very wealthy husband被发现死在他们的Beacon Hill大宅里was found shot to death in their Beacon Hill mansion.挖金女?Gold digger?这样想也不奇怪 那老头都60了You'd think so since the stiff was sixty,但她自己也很有钱but she was rich on her own.拥有一间庞大的健身公司Some kind of fitness empire.电视导购节目上还卖她的健身录像You can buy her exercise tapes on infomercials.你说的人是Brooke Taylor?Are you talking about Brooke Taylor?娘姓是Taylor 你认识她?Maiden name--Taylor.You know her?她是Delta Nu社团的 但她和我不是同期入会She's a Delta Nu! She wasn't in my pledge class.她比我早四年毕业She graduated four years before me.我以前上过她在洛杉矶运动俱乐部的班But I used to take her class at the Los Angeles Sports Club.她很厉害She's amazing!怎么个厉害法?Amazing? How?她可以帮你一节课减掉三磅She can make you lose three pounds in one class.她绝对是个天才She's completely gifted.很可能她也绝对是个杀人犯In all likelihood,she's completely guilty as well.我觉得Brooke不会杀人I just don't think Brooke could have done this.运动能产生内啡肽Exercise gives you endorphins.内啡肽能使人心情快乐Endorphins make you happy.快乐的人是不会杀自己丈夫的Happy people don't shoot their husbands.绝对不会They just don't.好了 对不起Dr.Tal Ben-Shahar: There you go.Sorry.大家知道在书里我谈过幸福革命You know in the book I talk about the happiness revolution.根据很多研究And I think based on a lot of research幸福革命的基础that the foundation for a happiness revolution一定伴随着运动革命而来has to come with an exercise revolution.为什么?因为如果我们不运动 就是违抗自然Why? Because if we don't exercise,we are fighting against nature所以幸福革命的基础So the foundation,the basis for the happiness revolution必须始于脖子以下的身体has to start neck down through the body.我们接着讲第二个身心疗法Let me move on to a second mind body intervention就是冥想and that is meditation.冥想是什么?我练瑜伽时第一次接触冥想So what is meditation? I was first introduced to it through Yoga.我当时打壁球弄伤了背I got injured,playing squash,my back.有人说练瑜伽有效果 我就开始练了They told me Yoga would help.I started Yoga.瑜伽不但治好了我的背 还有很多益处It helped my back and I got so much more out of it.432太多益处了In fact,so much more out of it that所以我现在跟Debbie Cohen学当瑜伽老师I'm doing my teacher training now with Debbie Cohen,将来会当上一名瑜伽老师and will become a Yoga instructor,如果她让我通过 应该很快就能当了hopefully very soon if she passes me.还有其他形式的意念冥想 静坐冥想There are other forms of mindful meditation- sitting meditation;太极 气功there is Tai Chi,Qi Gong;还有把注意力放在呼吸上的冥想there is meditation that just focuses on the breath;有把注意力放在同情心上的冥想there is meditation that focuses compassion.这些冥想都有一个共同点There are a few common elements to most types of meditation.我们来提其中几个Let me mention a few of them.首先 它们都专注于一件事物上First of all,it's focusing on one thing,可以是动作 姿势whether it's the movement,whether it's the posture,呼吸whether it's the breath,同情心 爱 善心whether it's compassion and loving and kindness,可以是火焰whether it's a flame.可以是…但它都专注于…Whatever it is,but it's focusing...可以是祈祷 反正就是一件事物上Whether it's a prayer.It's focusing on one thing.通常大部分的冥想Usually most forms of meditation-基础都是深呼吸the foundation is deep breathing.就像婴儿呼吸一样In a sense the way a baby breathes.用腹部呼吸 把气一直吸进腹部Belly breathing- breathe all the way to your belly然后慢慢地轻轻地呼出来and then slowly,gently,gracefully breathing out.深呼吸是很多冥想的基础Deep breathing is usually the foundation-不管是太极 瑜伽 还是静坐冥想whether it's Tai Chi,Yoga,or sitting meditation.最后 冥想没有好坏之分And finally,there is no good or bad meditation.从某个方面讲 冥想没有目的Meditation in a sense doesn't have a purpose在你冥想时 没有目的when you are meditating.你不能强求自己You are giving yourself the permission to be human.不会说"我刚刚做了一次很棒的冥想"There is no "ah I just had an amazing meditation,"或者"我觉悟了"or "I just feel enlightened."其实 我来给大家讲一个故事In fact,let me tell you a story about关于我是如何通过冥想觉悟的how I became enlightened through meditation.去年 我以前经常出行So last year,I used to travel quite a bit.我们那时住在以色列We lived in Israel,我平均每个月来美国几天but I travelled once a month on average to the US for a few days.当我来到这里时And when I travelled here,我通常都是演讲 还会借机静修I used to give talks but also used that time as a form of retreat我会做很多瑜伽And what I would do was I practiced a lot of Yoga,比我在以色列做得要多much more than I did in Israel.我做很多冥想 两场演讲之间有很多闲余时间I did a lot of meditation.I had a lot of time between talks.我经常利用这些时间静修So plenty of time I used it as a retreat.我记得有一次回到以色列And I remember one time coming home back to Israel and-我给大家讲一下当时的情景I just give you the context.在以色列 我们住在特拉维夫外的一个城市In Israel,we live in a city just outside Tel Aviv,叫Ramat Gancalled Ramat Gan.我们的房子在一栋20层的建筑里And we live- our house is in a 20-story building-我们住在10楼we live on the 10th floor.景色美不胜收And the view is just breath-taking.以色列是一个很小的国家You know Israel is just a very tiny country,so you can see...我可以看到以色列的两边 一边是地中海I can see both sides of Israel- the Mediterranean on one side;另一边能看到萨米尔山区I can see the Mountains of Samir on the other side.非常美丽的景色Just gorgeous view.我喜欢每天早上…And one of the things that I like to do is every morning-因为我是一个早起的人because I'm a morning person-通常比家人起得都要早I wake up usually before the rest of the family.我在客厅坐下I sit down in the dining room透过玻璃窗看外面and look outside through the glass window.我们有一个玻璃窗We have a glass window.因为楼层很高Since it's so high,我们用的是强化玻璃 有些窗是开不了的it's fortified glass of course and part of it does not open.我透过那扇没打开的窗看外面But I look through the part that does not open outside.我经常这样看And I do it very often.我记得有一次从美国回来后And I remember coming back from this particular trip and,我看窗外 突然from the US,and looking outside and suddenly,所有颜色都变得鲜艳多了all the colors seem so much brighter.整个世界似乎都变得更明亮了The world seems so much clear.我心里想"我肯定觉悟了"And I say to myself,"wow.I must've become enlightened."因为我在书上看过有人说Because I read in books and I heard people talking about it当你觉悟时 一切事物都变得明亮that when you become enlightened,everything becomes clear.世界变得比原来更美了The world becomes even more beautiful than it already is.我坐在沙发上And I were sitting there on the sofa,欣赏着鲜艳的颜色and just admiring the strong colors,美景 明亮的世界the beauty,the clarity of every thing.我心想"经过这么多年"And I said to myself,"after so many years"-我冥想了十年了I've been meditating for over ten years,"经过这么多年 我终于觉悟了""after so many years,I'm finally enlightened."我的行为举止开始变了And I started to act differently,因为觉悟了的人because you know enlightened people不会到处告诉别人他们觉悟了don't go around telling people they are enlightened.这节课是一个例外Well,this is an exception.但…我没有告诉别人But...So I didn't tell anyone.我甚至没有告诉Tammy我觉悟了I didn't even tell Tammy that I'm enlightened.第二天早上 我步履轻盈了But I was walking on air and the next day,the next morning,我醒来又开始我每天例行的看景I would wake up and again my ritual observation on off看着远处的山 我想the mountains in a distance and I said,"世界太美丽了 我觉悟了""wow.The world is so beautiful.I'm enlightened."这种情况持续了几天And that went on for a few days.有一天 Tammy和我坐在休息室里Then one day,Tammy and I were sitting together in the lounge,我们在聊天and just chatting.她看着窗外 我也看窗外And you know she was looking outside and I was looking outside.她说"你去了美国的这段时间And she said,"you know finally when you went away,我终于能把窗户擦干净了"after so long,I finally was able to clean the window."[Laugh]我说"什么?"I said,I said,"what?"她说"我一直都够不着窗外And she said,"you know I haven't been able to get out there.但我买了一个机器But I got this machine.一个有两边的机器 有一块磁铁的You know the two side machine with a,with a magnet.我终于买到这个机器 把窗擦干净了"I was finally able to get it.And I finally cleaned the window."我的觉悟原来是一场空欢喜So much for my enlightenment.也许真的有觉悟这回事 我也不知道So you know,maybe there is enlightenment- I don't know.但冥想的关键并不是达到这种境界But the key with meditation is not about reaching that stage,看到一切都变明亮了when everything suddenly becomes so clear.要想这样 把窗户擦干净可能更快You know I think the quicker path would be to clean the window.但觉悟不是冥想的目的But that's not what meditation is about.冥想是专注于现状 此时此刻Meditation is about being present,being in the here and now,与此时此刻的存在作挣扎struggling with being in the here and now.当我们思想涣散了And when we lose our thought,当我们对呼吸分心了 集中回来就行了when we lose our focus on the breath,simply bring it back.这就是冥想 分心 集中That is the practice- losing it and bringing it back.分心 集中Losing it and bringing it back.这样我们就能把思想锻炼得更专注And that's how we exercise our mind to be more focused,更留神to be more mindful.我给大家讲几个对冥想的研究So let me share with you some of the studies on meditation.对了 一旦你开始做冥想或瑜伽And once you start meditation or Yoga by the way,你会摸索出适合自己的方式you will find what is right for you.我有多动症 很难静下来坐着冥想Being ADHD,it was very difficult for me to do sitting meditation做瑜伽对我更有用Much more conducive for me to do Yoga.因为我练瑜伽时很认真Because I'm working hard.瑜伽能把我的注意力集中在姿势上It keeps my mind focused on the posture.对其他人来说 静坐冥想更适合For other people,the right thing is sitting meditation.静坐呼吸Just breathing.有些人会想着某一件事物For others,it's thinking about certain things.很多人会祈祷For many people,it's praying.只要适合你就行了Whatever works for you.你甚至可以同时做几件事And it can be of course a few things.你可以一边祈祷一边做瑜伽You can pray and do Yoga.我来给大家讲几个研究So let me share with you some of the studies.关于冥想的严肃研究The real serious studies on meditation一开始是研究冥想界中的佼佼者started by looking at the tip of the stem.那些练习冥想很多年的冥想者The meditators,people who have been doing it for many years,练习了很久的人for a very long time.这些研究者包括Richie DavidsonAnd what they asked,the researchers like Richie Davidson,任职于威斯康星大学University of Wisconsin,伍斯特大学的Jon Kabat-ZinnJon Kabat-Zinn from University of Worcester,像Herbert Benson这样的人people like Herbert Benson,00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:33,780加州大学的Paul Ackerman 还有其他人Paul Ackerman from one the UCs,and other people.他们想研究冥想时When they wanted to study meditation,他们说"我们来研究最好的冥想者"they said "let's study the best."所以他们联系了达赖喇嘛 说So they contacted the Dalai Lama himself and said,"你能推荐一些冥想了"can you suggest some people who have been meditating很久的认真的冥想者吗for a very long time- serious meditators;我们想研究他们的大脑"and we want to study their brain."他们找到了 把这些人找来So they did.And they brought them in.他们研究的第一样东西是 大家应该记得And what they looked for,the first thing,remember,左前额皮层和右前额皮层的比例left to right prefrontal cortex ratio.大家记得 我们之前谈过And if you remember,we talked about it-快乐的人通常更活跃的地方people who are happier generally have more activation是左前额皮层on the left side of the prefrontal cortex;不快乐的人更活跃的地方people who are less happy have more activation是右前额皮层on the right side of the prefrontal cortex.所以这个比例很重要So that ratio is important.它是测量快乐的一个"客观"手段And it's one of the "objective" means of measuring happiness.他们得出的一个发现是One of the things that they have found is that两者之间存在很大关联there is very high correlation在扫描器下看到的大脑between what our brains look like under the scanner和我们对自己是否快乐的自我报告and our self-report about how happy we are-当然不是100%的关联 但也不低 很高not 100 percent correlation,not at 1,but pretty high,这表明自我报告是很可靠的suggesting the self-reports are pretty,are quite reliable.总之 他们想研究这些冥想者的大脑But anyway,so they wanted to look at the brain of the meditators他们再比较普通大众And when they looked at the general public,我们都在一个钟形曲线内we all exist on a Bell curve.快乐的人更靠前The happier people are further on左侧皮层更活跃more activation on the left side;不快乐的人更靠后the less happy people are further-右侧皮层更活跃more activation,higher ratio on the right side.然后他们找来这些冥想者And then they brought in the meditators.测出他们左前额皮层和左前额皮层的比例And they measured their left to right prefrontal cortex.这是他们的研究发现And here is what they found.这是正常的钟形曲线This is the normal Bell curve.冥想者在这里This is where the meditators were.这是2001年的研究 他们找了很多冥想者This is from 2001- since,they have found numerous meditators他们几乎偏离了这个图that are quite literally off the chart,表明快乐的程度很高suggesting very high levels of well being and happiness.他们很容易感染积极情绪Being susceptible to positive emotions,对痛苦情绪的抵抗力很强and resilient in the face of painful emotions.这是一个很惊人的结果So this is a remarkable result.这些结果之前没人发现过Again,results that are not seen before直到他们研究了这些冥想者until they measured these meditators.另一个研究方面就是The other things that他们想看看另一个重要的指标they were interested is looking at other important indicator衡量健康和冷静的惊吓反应for well being and calmness is the startle response.当你听到一声巨响 你会吓一跳When you hear a bang,you startle.这个惊吓反应很重要And the startle response is important,因为你越容易受到惊吓because the easier you get startled,通常说明你焦虑程度更高generally it's correlated to the higher levels of anxiety,至少容易产生焦虑susceptibility at least to anxiety.大家都有一定的惊吓反应And everyone has this startle response to some degree.即使是军队里的神枪手Even marksmen and women in the military,他们每天都射枪you know,who shoot their guns everyday他们要完全集中注意力and they are trying to remain completely focus.当枪走火时 他们也会受到惊吓Even they startle,when the gun goes off.他们会微微地抖一下 这也是惊吓反应They flinch.Very slightly,but they do.要压抑惊吓反应是不可能的So it's impossible to suppress the startle response.或者说当时的人是这样想的Or so they thought.Paul Ackerman找来这些冥想者When Paul Ackerman brought these meditators in叫他们保持绝对镇定和冷静and asked them to maintain complete equanimity and calmness,他吓他们and he startled them.他们一点反应都没有 有记录以来第一次There was no reaction whatsoever.First time in recorded history.有人能够抑压自己的惊吓反应That people are,have been able to suppress the startle response.Goleman writes在他的书中这样写道Here was what Daniel Goleman writes about this in his book,破坏性情绪 "一个人惊吓反应越大Destructive Emotions: "Given that the larger someone's startle,那个人就越可能the more intensely that出现消极情绪person tends to experience upsetting emotions,Oser的表现有着有趣的含意Oser's performance had tantalizing implications,表明他的情绪有着惊人的镇定"suggesting a remarkable level of emotional equanimity."这种镇定还会传染That equanimity was also contagious-如果有人想和这些喇嘛争吵so people who tried to argue with these monks,他们会很难生起气来very often had a hard time becoming angry or upset即使这个话题很容易让他们生气even if the topic was upset,personally upsetting to them,例如科学家争论上帝是否存在such as scientists arguing about the existence of God.他们说"我生不起气来"And they said,"I couldn't get upset."因为平静是会传染的 就是快乐会传染一样Because calm is contagious,just like happiness is.有些同学可能不百分百了解Now some of you may not be 100 percent clear about什么是惊吓反应what the startle response is.对于不了解惊吓反应的同学 我准备了一个短片So for those of you who are not,I've prepared a very brief clip.(惊吓反应视频)[VIDEO: Clip on Startle Response]面具吓不了他Oh sure the mask doesn't do anything to him.你想知道什么吓到他了吗?But you wanna see something really scary?是爸爸It's Dad![Laugh]好了 现在大家明白了Dr.Tal Ben-Shahar: OK.All right.Now you understand.他们研究这些冥想者时When they studied these meditators,基本上他们方法就是应用essentially what they were doing was applying我们之前讲过的what we've talked about,生长锥数据 或者Maslow讲过的the growing tip statistic or Maslow talks about,生长锥数据 研究最好的the growing tip statistic- studying the best.因为如果你想推动知识发展Because if you want to advance knowledge,如果你想更好地应用可行理论if you want to better apply ideas that work,你不会研究普通老师 你会研究Marva Colinsyou don't study the average teacher,you study Marva Colins.你不会研究普通的冥想者You don't study the average meditator,自以为觉悟了的冥想者 你研究那些who thinks he's enlightened,you study the meditators冥想了很多年的冥想者who have been doing it for for many years.其中一个冥想者Oser喇嘛说Lama Oser,one of these meditators:"冥想本身有一些与众不同的特质"The process itself has some extraordinary qualities,但这与进行冥想的人无关but not necessarily the subject.重要的一点是 冥想并非触不可及的The important idea is that this process is within the reach of只要你有足够的决心来练习它"anyone who applies himself or herself with enough determination."也就是说 冥想并不专属于少数几个人In other words,this is not just for the selected few,那些每天8小时地冥想了30年的人who can meditate for 30 years,8 hours a day.大家都可以冥想It can be applied因为这个过程对所有人来说都很简单because the process is relatively simple to all of us.Daniel Goleman说"从神经科学的角度看Daniel Goleman: "From the perspective of neuroscience,这个研究的重点the point of all this research并不是为了说明has nothing to do with demonstrating thatOser或者其他厉害的冥想者Oser or any other extraordinary person本身有什么过人之处may be remarkable in him-or herself,but而是为了扩展这个领域对于人体潜力的假设rather to stretch the field's assumptions about human possibility其中一些关键假设已经开始扩展了Some of these key assumptions have already begun to expand,部分原因是神经科学in part due to a revolution in neuroscience's supposition对大脑可塑性作出革命性猜想"about the malleability of the brain itself."大家记住 神经塑性 神经形成Remember neuroplasticity.Neurogenesis.这些概念 我和These concepts that I and...像Richie Davidson这样的科学家认为how scientists like Richie Davidson identified大脑是可塑的 可以改变的that our brain is malleable,it can change.改变的方法之一就是冥想And one of the ways to change it is through meditation.这种观点非常好Now this is all well and good.所以我们可以下决心把它应用于生活中So we can apply this process with determination to our lives.但这课室里有多少人会认真地说But how many people here seriously would say,"听起来很好"OK.That sounds great.我想我的左前额皮层更活跃I want my left side of the prefrontal cortex to be more active.所以我要去喜马拉雅山So I'm gonna go off to Himalayas每天8小时地冥想30年"and meditate for 30 years,8 hours a day.有多少人真的准备这么做?I mean,how many people are really prepared to do this?有多少人每天有两小时做冥想?How many people have time for 2 hours a day of meditation?这个研究的第二个问题是 两者之间只是关联The second problem with this research is that it's correlational.但并没有因果关系There's no causation here.也许Oser喇嘛天生就是这样Maybe Lama Oser was born that way;所以他才对冥想产生兴趣that's why he was attracted to meditation.也许Matthieu Ricard…他写了一本关于幸福的书Maybe Matthieu Ricard- he's written a book on happiness-他是达赖喇嘛的翻译 一个右撇子Dalai Lama's translator,right-hand man.也许他天生就是这样Maybe he was born that way左前额皮层比右前额皮层活跃得多with a remarkable left to right prefrontal cortex.702对了 他的比例完全超出钟形曲线He's,by the way,literally off the charts.除了因果关系 还有一个主要问题 时间But the main problem still remains- beyond causation is the time.我们有时间吗Do we have the time,我们有耐心经常长时间冥想吗?do we have the patience to meditate so often and so much?我发现当我开始冥想You know when I found out,when I started to meditate,开始做瑜伽时 我真的能看到益处to do Yoga,I really saw the benefits of it.我说"我每天做半小时And I said,"OK.So I'm getting the benefits就能收到成效了when I am doing it for half an hour a day.如果我进行一次长时间静修呢?"What if I do a real,longer retreat?"所以我想进行十天的静修And I have some great 10 day long retreats.我跟TammyAnd I said to Tammy,"我想去静修十天""you know,I want to go to a 10 day retreat."Tammy很了解我And Tammy knows me pretty well,她说"不如你试试…and she said,"you know,why don't you try...你不用要么不做 要么就做到足You know it's not all or nothing.不如你试试先静修一天Why don't you try a one day retreat first然后再进行为期十天的静修?"before you go on a 10 day retreat?"我说"这是个好主意"And I said,"you know,it's a good idea!"我开始为期一天的静修And I went to a one day retreat,离这里不远 就在剑桥which is not very far from here,in Cambridge.我踏上这段静修之行 非常激动And I went to this retreat and I was very excited.那天是星期六 我盼了一整周It was on a Saturday.And I was looking for it all week.我当时想"通过这一天的静修I said,"I'm starting the process of enlightenment,我就踏上觉悟之路了of course,through this one day retreat.等我做完这一天的静修And once after that one day retreat,等我向Tammy证明这对我有很大益处时once I prove to Tammy that it's good for me,她就会看到我静修后有多平静she'll see how calm I am after.她就会说'好的 去静修十天吧'"She'll say,'sure.Go for the 10 day retreat."所以我去了静修一天So I went for that one day retreat.那一天的静修 我们进去看到一个男人And the one day retreat- we came in; there was a gentleman长着胡子 坐在一班学生前who was sitting in front of the class with the beard,显得非常平静looking very calm.我想"静修完今天 我就能像他那样了And I said,"I'm going to look like him at the end of the day.除了没他的胡子" 我们坐下And...Minus the beard." And we sat down.他说"我们先从静坐冥想开始"He said,"we are going to start with sitting meditation."我们都坐下So we all sat.我们都有坐垫 我需要几个坐垫You know we had our cushion.I need a few cushions there.我们坐在那里 我把手放在这里We were sitting there.I put my hands here.他说"好了 深呼吸 从鼻孔吸进去He said,"OK.Breathe deeply.Through your nostrils.然后呼出来"And then breathe out again."我们跟着做 我坐在那里And we did that.And I was sitting there.我有多运症 我的思想开始涣散And my mind- you know being ADHD- started to wander.他说"如果思想涣散了 集中回来"But he said,"if the mind wanders,bring it back to the focus."我们坐了…And we were sitting there and for-我觉得很长时间what it seems like- a very long time.我坚持住 我想"你思想涣散了 没关系And I stayed there.And I said,"OK.Your mind wanders.It's OK.集中回来" 我继续坐在那里Come back to it." And I continued to sit there.我们坐了45分钟 最后他说And we sat there for 45 minutes.And at the end,he said,"慢慢地轻轻地睁开眼睛 站起来""OK.Gently,slowly open your eyes.And stand up."他说"接下来And he said,"what we are gonna do now,经过45分钟后 我们开始第二部分the second part after the 45 minutes,第一部分是静坐冥想first part,the sitting meditation-接下来我们要行走冥想"we are going to do some walking meditation."他解释了一下And he illustrated it.然后我们围成一个圈 跟着他走And then we walked behind him,around in a circle.我们走得很慢 很认真And we walked very slowly,very diligently.把注意力集中到每一步上 把腿抬起Just focusing on each step.Lifting up the leg.他说"集中到动作上He said,"just focus on the movement.专注于此时此刻 如果你思想涣散了"Be present in the here and now.And if your mind wanders,"我经常这样 "再集中回行走上which mine did constantly,"bring it back to the walking.继续深呼吸And continue to breathe deeply.就像刚才静坐冥想一样"Just like what you did in the sitting meditation."所以我们绕着房间 走了很久So we were walking around the room for a very long time.继续走 绕着房间走And we walked.And we continued to walk around that room.我的思想继续涣散 我感到无聊了And my mind continued to wander.And I got bored.我开始四处看别人So what I did was I started to look around at the other people.他们都绕着圈子走着And they were all walking in the circle.然后我看了老师坐的地方And then I looked to where the teacher was sitting.老师旁边有一张纸And next to the teacher,there was a piece of paper.我想"真有趣 不知道上面写了什么呢"I thought,"oh interesting.I wonder what it says there."所以我继续走 又走到那张纸那里So I continued to walk and I got to the piece of paper again.我想"是时间安排表 真有趣"And I said,"oh it's a schedule.How interesting!"我不够时间看清上面写什么And I didn't have enough time to read what it said.我想"下一圈我就有盼头了"So I said,"next round I have something to look forward to!"所以我继续走 我看到…So I continued to walk.And I see...我看到我们刚上完的课 45分钟静坐冥想Oh I see this is what we did- 45 minutes of sitting meditation后面就是45分钟的行走冥想and after that 45 minutes of walking meditation.Ha?接下来是什么呢?我继续走I wonder what's next.And I continued to walk.我有盼头了 所以很高兴And now I have something to look forward to.I was excited.我往下看 45分钟静坐冥想?And I look just below- 45 minutes of sitting meditation?然后 45分钟行走冥想?And then- 45 minutes of walking meditation?又是静坐和行走Wow! And another sitting and walking...然后是午餐 午餐后面是什么呢?Oh and lunch! I wonder what we do after lunch!45分钟静坐冥想?然后是行走…天啊45 minutes of sitting meditation? And walking...Wow.然后是行走冥想?于是我心里想And after that,walking meditation? So I thought to myself,"太恐怖了 再见 天啊""wow.This is incredible! I'll see you next time! Jeez!"我走出去了 我受不了了 所以…And I walked out.I just...I couldn't take it! So...我跑回家了 说实话我感到很尴尬And I ran home,but I must say,I was a little bit embarrassed.所以我想"不如我在外面逛一天"So I said,"wait.Maybe I'll spend the day outside."回家时装出一副觉悟的样子You know,just come back home and seem enlightened at least.但我没有这样做 我打给TammyBut I didn't.So I called Tammy.我告诉她"你想和我一起吃早餐吗?"And I told her,"do you want to have breakfast together?"我们一起吃了 她明白这是人之常情And we did.She gives me the permission to be human.我觉得自己无法静修十天I don't see myself going on a 10 day retreat.我觉得自己无法静修30年I don't see myself going on a 30 year retreat.我的问题是 在这种情况下And my question was that as it is now,那些不想 或者无法长时间冥想的人how can meditation help people who don't want to冥想怎么帮得了他们?or simply can't meditate for such a long time?别误会我的意思And don't get me wrong.我推荐大家进行静修I do recommend these retreats.有些人去了静修以后There are people who go to these retreats变得不同了and come out looking differently.我见过 我有很多朋友去过I mean I've seen...I know.Many of my friends have been there.再说回来 静修一天还是十天…But that's- again,a one day retreat or a 10 day retreat;有些人静修了长达三个月some people have gone as long to as 3 months retreat他们都取得很好成果and they are good.但我坚持不来Just not for me.我们该怎么做呢?Jon Kabat-Zinn在他的研究中So what can we do? Jon Kabat-Zinn in his research,告诉了我们冥想如何应用于showed how meditation can apply to people那些没有一整天闲余时间 每天只能抽45分钟的人who don't want to do full days,who just have 45 minutes a day甚至如何每天抽15分钟冥想或者做瑜伽or as little as 15 minutes a day for meditation or Yoga,或者其他形式的意念练习or some form of mindfulness.他做了两件事And he did two things.第一件First of all,他表明了冥想不到30年的人从中得到什么益处he showed how it helps for people who do less than 30 years.第二件同样重要 他表明了因果关系的存在And second,equally important,he showed causation.他的一个研究中有两组人So he took two groups in one of his studies.两组Two groups.两组都想做冥想The one group- both groups wanted to do meditation,他们都有这个兴趣so they expressed the interest-他让其中一组等候one group he put on a waiting list.他说And he said,你们将在三个月后参加这个冥想班you are participating this seminar in about three months.是四个月 四个月后Or...It was 4 months.In 4 months,你们将参加这个报满了的冥想班you'll be participating the seminar where all booked out.第二组开始这个班的冥想练习The second group started the meditation regime workshop then.他们的练习就是每天冥想45分钟And the regime was essentially 45 minutes of meditation a day.周末时他们会聚到一起During the weekend,they were together;学习一些技巧they learned some techniques.但在工作日时 他们在家里But during the week,when they were at home,每天冥想45分钟45 minutes a day of meditation.然后他拿他们跟参考组对比And then he compared them to the control group-参考组就是那个等待参加冥想班的组the group that was waiting for a retreat,waiting for the lessons因为他希望实验对象都是Because he wanted them to be the same kind-想做冥想的人people who wanted to do meditation.一组已经开始冥想 另一组迟点再开始One that has actually started; one that is going to start soon.然后他测量焦虑程度 对比参考组And then he measured anxiety and compared to the control group-那个冥想了八周的人的焦虑程度anxiety levels of those who did meditation for 8 weeks.平均每天45分钟 只做了八周Just 8 weeks.45 minutes a day on average.焦虑程度大大降低Anxiety decreased significantly.然后他研究他们的快乐程度Then he looked at their happiness level,积极的情绪 他不只关注消极程绪like the positive- not just the negative to the zero;从消极到积极的都关注the zero to the positive.他们更快乐了 心情更好了And they were happier.They had better moods.仅仅八周 但关键还在后头After as little as 8 weeks.But here are the clinchers.他说He then said,"这还不够 自我报告有可能产生安慰剂效应""well,it's not enough- just self-reported could be placebo,"-这个想法很好which is great,他要不受安慰剂效应影响的证据but he wanted to see something else beyond just placebo.然后他有了这个发现And here is what he found.他研究他们的左右前额皮层比例He looked at their left to right prefrontal cortex.仅仅八周之后And after as little as 8 weeks,那些冥想的人there was a significant difference就出现显著的变化in those individuals who meditated.这是一个很惊人的结果Now this is a remarkable result.大家记住 1998年之前Remember until 1998,科学家都深信大脑是不可塑的scientists were sure that the brain is not malleable;过了三岁以后就不会改变does not change pass the age of 3 or so.突然仅仅八周的练习And suddenly here with this little,with as little as 8 weeks,这些冥想的人these meditators,or individuals,每天有规律地冥想45分钟的人you know regular people doing 45 minutes of meditation a day,改变了他们大脑的机能are changing the way their brain functions,使得他们更容易感染积极情绪making them more susceptible to positive emotions,对痛苦情绪的抵抗力更强more resilient in the face of painful emotions.我们哈佛医学院的Herbert BensonHerbert Benson from our medical school here发现每天做15到20分钟的冥想are showing with as little as 15-20 minutes a day of meditation,做了一段时间后 就能大大地改善健康you see a significant change over time in levels of well being.00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:29,880情绪健康和身体健康都改善了Emotional well being as well as physical well being.因为Jon Kabat-Zinn做了另一个研究Because the other study that Jon Kabat-Zinn did他给两组人都注射了…with these meditators was injecting both groups-那组等候冥想的参考组和进行冥想的那组the control group who are waiting and the meditators.他给他们注射了感冒细菌He injected them with cold bacteria.他想测的是And what he wanted to do,what he wanted to measure was他们体内的抗体会有什么反应how would their bodies react in terms of antibodies.他发现冥想者的免疫反应And what he found was that the meditators' immune response比那些没有冥想的人强了很多was significantly stronger than those who didn't meditate,那些在等候冥想的人who were waiting to meditate.只需八周的冥想 每天45分钟Just based on 8 weeks of meditation,45 minutes a day.我们知道And we know that.你们知道当我们更平静时You know when we are calmer,我们对疾病的抵抗力就会增强we are less susceptible to illnesses.我们焦虑时 就更容易患上疾病When we are stressed,we are more susceptible to illnesses.所以冥想能加强So meditation strengthens both-心理免疫系统 增强心理抵抗力the psychological immune system in making us more resilient,同时还能改善身体免疫系统as well as the physical immune system.意志训练应用于很多领域Mindfulness has been used in numerous areas,成为很多领域中的一种治疗方法numerous places as therapy.今天就更是如此了More and more so today.配合认知疗法Both as in,together with cognitive therapy,配合药物 冥想 或者单纯冥想together with medicine,medication as well as on its own.研究已经表明这种方法非常有效And it's been shown to be extremely effective.我推荐一本书The book I recommend,如果你想对这个领域有一个深刻的初步认识if you want to get a good outline of what the field has to say我推荐大家看《改善情绪的正念疗法》is called The Mindful Way Through Depression.这本书是讲It talks about意念如何能帮我们克服严重抑郁how mindfulness can help us overcome major depression,中度抑郁 或者焦虑mild depression as well as things like anxiety还能改善其他心理疾病and how it can also help other psychological disorders.例如这本书中讲到的一件事And one of the things for example that they show there-我们知道we know from,很不幸 一旦一个人患了严重抑郁unfortunately we know that once someone has major depression,复发的可能the likelihood of it reappearing,不管是一周后 还是一年后whether it's a month later or sometimes years later比从来没患过严重抑郁的人要高很多is much higher than if we never have major depression.为什么?回忆一下我们之前讲过的内容Why? Think about what we have discussed before.我们讲过大脑是如何形成神经通路的What we talked about is how the brain creates neural pathways.一旦神经通路形成Now if a neural pathway has been created-因为抑郁症的神经通路很强烈and it's a strong neural pathway of depression,通常一点相对不严重的事发生了very often something which is relatively mild都能让这条神经通路活跃过来but happens can send us back to that neural pathway.如果我们有一段时间情绪不好 哪怕是一点小事So we through a relatively hard period,nothing that serious,but马上大脑就会寻找最大的那条神经通路immediately the brain looks for that the largest neural pathway,形象一点说 最大的那条河流the largest river metaphorically speaking.它就会找到那条通路And it goes there.所以因为一点很小的原因 严重抑郁症复发了And we have the major depression again with little reason.复发了两三次后And after we have it two or three times,这条神经通道更强烈了 复发可能性更高了the neural pathway is even stronger,even more likely to recur.他发现 当他们进行正念冥想What he found when they introduced mindfulness meditation or或者正念疗法 再配以认知行为疗法mindfulness therapy in addition to cognitive behavioral therapy就能减少严重抑郁症复发的可能was it reduced the likelihood of recurrence of major depression那些患有 或曾经患过严重抑郁症的人among people who have major depression or had major depression-能减少50%的复发可能reduces the likelihood by over 50 percent of relapse.这是一个纵向研究 这种方法真的很有用That is a longitudinal study.So that really helps.还能改善中度以下的的抑郁症It also helps deal with non major depression.帮助处理悲伤情绪It helps dealing with sadness.这种方法是怎么起作用的?Now how does it work? How does it work?我简单地…再说一次 我很推荐这本书Let me very briefly- again I do recommend this book;光用这本书就可以开一门课程we can have a whole course on this book.这本书还介绍了一个很棒的八周疗法This book also got an 8 week program which is fantastic.第一步是察觉Its first level is about awareness并接受身体信号and acceptance of the body signal.这是什么意思?What do they mean here?当我们感受到一种情绪时You see,whenever we enter experiencing emotion,通常会伴有一个身体反应there is always a physical manifestation to it.例如像快乐这样的积极情绪 可能会忐忑Positive emotions such as happiness- it could be butterflies or可能只是会感到上半身豁然开朗you know just feeling very broad in the upper body whatever it is痛苦情绪也有身体反应but also painful emotions.例如For example,我个人来说 当我感到焦虑时 这里if I experience,personal when I experience anxiety,it's here.我能感受到它在这里I feel it here.或者这里 我以前讲过 就像胃打了个结一样Or here.The knot in my stomach that I talked about.感受到抑郁甚至悲伤的人People who experience depression or even sadness,会感觉到它在某一身体部位 可能在胃feel it somewhere- again whether it's in the stomach,可能在肩膀whether it's in the shoulders,一个情绪there is always a physical manifestation总是伴有身体反应的to an emotional experience.研究者认为 以及研究发现表明And what they are saying and what the research has shown当我们开始感受到痛苦情绪时is that when we begin to experience a painful emotion,我们马上就要开始运用意念immediately going and becoming mindful,开始找出这个身体反应在哪里aware of where the physical manifestation is.而不要钻角头尖So instead of beginning to ruminate"为什么我会抑郁""怎么回事"and to dwell on "why am I depressed","what's going on","发生什么事了""又犯了""千万别又犯了""what's happening","not again","I hope this won't start..."我们不要马上想到这些Instead of going in to this rumination,而是马上找出这个情绪的身体反应going immediately to the physical manifestation of it,想到身体to the body.我开始感到有压力 好的So I'm beginning to feel stressed.OK.把注意力集中到这里 接受这个结And focusing on it and accepting that knot.不要尝试去消除它 这点我们稍后会谈Not trying to fix it as we'll talk about in a minute.只需接受它的存在 看着它想Simply accepting it for what it is,looking at it and saying,"真有趣 很大的一个结""oh.That's interesting.Oh it's quite a big knot."不 很小 在变大了"Oh no it's small.Oh it's getting actually bigger."而不要想As opposed to saying"我想它消失 它消失了 真有趣""I want it to go away.Oh it is going away.That's interesting."这不是这一步的目的But that's not the purpose.这一步的目的只需察觉到它的存在The purpose is simply to become aware of it,只需察觉到simply to become aware of这种情绪引起的身体反应whatever the physical manifestation of the emotion is.为什么这样能行得通?Now why does it work?它能行得通是因为它形成了一条新的神经通路It works because it creates an alternative neural pathway.在原来的神经通路下 当我们感到不适时With a usual pathway that it's created,when we feel dis-easy,脑袋就会发现不适 苦苦思索它it's going into the mind,ruminating about it通常就会走回原有的通路里and usually going to the channel that existed before.这些原来的通路The channels or channels that existed before,是和我们的抑郁相连的and these channels are associated with our depression和我们之前的消极情绪相连 并且得到增强or previous negative experiences that have been reinforced.我们现在要做的What we are doing now,不是走回我们脑袋里这些增强了的通路上instead of going into these enforced channels inside our mind并且再一次增强它们and further reinforcing them,而是形成一条新的通路 痛了?we are creating an alternative one- oh pain?!我们进入身体Let's go to the body.那条新通路And that alternative channel-这个方法管用是因为当我们形成新通路时the reason why it works because that's when we are drawing,它通往我们身体的自然治愈能力that's when we are going to the body's natural ability to heal.我们患上的大部分疾病Most of the illnesses that we face,不是全部 但大部分病身体都能自行治愈the body has- most not all- has the compacity to heal itself.大部分切伤的伤口Most of the cuts that you get-你不用管它you don't need to do anything about it.事实上 你不应该处理小伤口In fact,you shouldn't do anything about small cuts.你不用弄它 看它 摸它You know play with it.Look at it.Touch it.让自然的力量来治愈它Just let nature take its course.它会自己愈合的 消化也一样It will fix it by itself.Same with digestion.你不用想着消化You don't need to think about digest...身体有自己的内在智慧 内在医生The body has its own internal wisdom,its own internal healer.同样道理And this is exactly what happens当你不再集中注意力想when you go and you divert attention from"我该怎么消除它 怎么回事"oh what I'm gonna do about it; What's happening;太难受了 我不想这么难受it's so terrible; I hope I wouldn't feel this way;我希望快点好起来I hope I feel better soon;为什么我会这么难受 因为什么原因"and why I'm feeling this way; what's the cause."有时候这样想它 分析它Somtimes it's important to do it and to analyze it,把它写下来很重要 但不要钻牛角尖to write about it,as opposed to to ruminate about it,或者跟人谈谈 但不要钻牛角尖or to talk to someone about it,as opposed to ruminating about it最有效的But the most effective,在大部分情况下 就是马上想到身体的感觉in most situations is just to go to the body,bodily sensation.察觉它 接受它 不要尝试去治好它And be aware of it.Accept it.Don't try to fix it.让它留在那里 观察它Just let it be there and just observe it.我们身体内的医生就会治好它And the,our internal healer will take care of itself.要熟练运用这种方法 关键是练习The key,in order to become adept at it is to practice.练习It's to practice it.一次又一次地练习To do it over and over again,就像我们在课堂上讲到的其他方法一样just like everything else that we've discussed in this class.没有捷径There are no quick fixes.我们怎么练习?How do we practice it?首先 这是书中的八周疗法中的一部分First- and this is part of their 8 week program,我现在也在练 首先是身体扫描which is what I'm doing right now- the first is body scan.了解你的身体Become aware of your body躺下来 思考 观察just by lying down and thinking and observing.先从你的脚开始 然后了解你的膝盖First of all,your foot and then becoming aware of your knee,了解你胯部的感觉becoming aware of sensations in your crotch,了解你胃的感觉becoming aware of sensations in your stomach.每一个身体部位都是Wherever it is.了解整个身体Going through the whole body.多练习 多了解And practicing it,becoming more aware.这是冷状态下的练习And this is doing it in a cold state.在模拟状态下的练习This is doing it in the practice,in a simulator.当我们在热状态下Then when we are in a hot state,当我们真正感受到那种痛苦情绪时when we actually experience that emotion,that painful emotion,我们就准备好用这种方法 我们知道怎么用we are ready to go to it and we know what to do.练习时 如果我们精神分散了 再集中起来Practice also means when we lose focus,we go back to it.这是练习And that's the practice.练习并不表示30分钟都要完全集中注意力The practice is not remaining completely centered for 30 minutes.练习时 精神分散了 再集中The practice is losing and coming back.精神分散了 再集中Losing focus and coming back again.然后在现实生活中也要练习And then,also practicing in the real life.所以当我感到压力时 我想"好的So whenever I feel stressed,merely going"OK.这种情绪引起什么身体反应?"So what's the physical manifestation of it?"现在我们谈了情绪Now here we are talking about the emotions;谈了身体we are talking about the body.00:59:52,920 --> 01:00:00,你们也可以用认知重建来练习You can also practice by using cognitive reconstruction.怎样练习?举个例子How? For instance.例如我想到今晚我要做的一个讲座Let's say I'm thinking about a talk that I have to give tonight.我感到很紧张And I'm very nervous for it.很多观众 重要的观众Large audience.Important audience.每次想到这 我第一个反应就是紧张And every time I think of it,my initial inclination is stress.我感受到这里的肾上腺素 很难受And I get this adrenalin feel here and I don't feel good about it感到我胃打了一个结Or the knot in my stomach.我怎么办?每次想到这讲座 我就会想So how do I deal with it? Each time I think about it,I say,"好的 这个身体反应在哪里?""OK.Where am I feeling it in the body?"另一个方法就是用认知重建它Another way of dealing with it is cognitively reconstructing it,不要觉得它是压力 觉得它是荣幸saying instead of stress,what a privilege.我刚才说过Remember I told you that我要跟一个很大的客户谈I had a very large client that I had to speak to,我为这次演讲感到很大压力I was very stressed about that talk.每次我脑袋想到这压力时And every time my mind went to stress,马上我跟自己说"不 这是荣幸within half a second I said,"no,it's a privilege.我能有这样的机会做讲座真是太棒了"It's so wonderful that I have the opportunity to do it."重申 这不同于逃避Again,this is different from avoiding.不同于抑制This is different from repressing.有时候只需要接受它There is a time to simply accept明白这是人之常情and to give ourselves the permission to be human.但是 苦苦思索这种情绪上是没用的However it's useless to just constantly ruminate about it只会加强这条神经通路and simply strengthen the neural pathways.这种反应 或者专注于身体So this reaction of either going to the physical body或者专注于认知重建or sometimes going to the cognitive reconstruction都很有用can be very useful.记得 当我们想改变时Remember when we want change,我们要想到尽可能多的可能性we want to draw as much as possible on A,B and C-想到情感 行为 认知的方法on affect,on behavior,and cognition.这只是其中两个有用的办法And these are just two very helpful techniques.我经常用这种方法 或者专注于身体I use it constantly,whether it's going in the body或者专注于认知重建or going in cognitive reconstructing.非常有用Extremely helpful.有数据证明它多有用Again the data shows how helpful it is.我们也来做一次简单的正念冥想Let's try it.Let's do a quick mindfulness meditation运用我讲过的一些方法and incorporating some of the ideas that I discuss now和我们以前讲过的一些内容and things that we've discussed in the past.大家尽可能舒服地坐在座位上So sit comfortably in your seats as much as possible.后背挺直Your back straight,如果背靠着椅子更舒服的话 就靠吧leaning on the back if that is more comfortable.把脖子尽量伸长Elongate your neck as much as possible.上半身形成一条直线Create a straight line in your upper body.把脚尽量舒服地放在地板上Plant your feet as comfortably as you can on the floor.如果觉得交叉着腿不舒服的 就放下来If there's a cross and you feel uncomfortable,uncross them.可以把你的手放在腿上And rest your hands either on your legs也可以合起来 你觉得舒服就行了or fold it however you feel comfortable.如果你觉得闭上眼睛舒服的 就闭上And if you feel comfortable,close your eyes.不管现在你的注意力在哪里Wherever your attention is now,都把它集中在你的呼吸上wherever your focus is now,bring it to your breath.深深地吸进腹部Breathe deeply into your belly然后慢慢地轻轻地呼出来and then breathe slowly,gently,gracefully out.深吸一口气 慢慢地轻轻地呼出来Take a deep breath and slow,gentle,quiet exhalation.重复几次And repeat this a few times.如果你精神分散了If your mind wanders,慢慢把它集中回呼吸和练习上就行了simply,gently bring it back to the breath and practice.一边呼吸 一边转移你的注意力As you continue to breathe,shift your attention,转移到你的身体上your focus to your body-你的脚 小腿 腿 手腕 腹部 背your feet,shins,your legs,your wrist,your belly,your back.扫描你全身 你的胸膛 脖子 头Just scan your whole body- your chest,neck,your head.找出你身体感到微微紧张的地方And find one area in your body that is slightly tense,比其他部位更紧张的地方that you feel more than others,没有其他部位那么放松的地方that is less relaxed than the rest of the body.不管是哪个身体部位And whatever that part of the body is,把你的注意力转移到上面 观察不适shift your attention there and observe the discomfort,观察这股紧张感observe the tension.观察它 接受它Just observe and accept it is.继续一边深呼吸Continue to breathe deeply一边观察这个身体部位as you are observing that part of the body.看看这多有趣And just look how interesting it is.你那个部位有这样一个感觉That you have that sensation there.每呼吸一次 就接受它With each breath,embrace it.你的感觉There's nothing right;没有对错之分there's nothing wrong with how you feel.它只是一种感觉The feeling simply is.继续深呼吸And continue with the breath吸进那个部位 再从那里呼出来to breathe into that part and out of that part.只需观察它 接受它 与它同在Simply observing it,accepting it,being with it.继续与你那个身体部位同在Continue to be with that part of your body,一边呼吸 一边感受这种感觉with your breath and experience the experience.不管是什么感觉 感受它Whatever it is,it is.然后轻轻地把注意力从那个部位移开And then gently say goodbye to the focus on that particular part.轻轻地Very gently,因为你已经接受它了 你要回到呼吸上because you just embrace it and return to your breath.用你的呼吸洗涤整个身体And with your breath,wash,cleanse your entire body.从你的灵魂开始Starting with your souls,从下到上 一直到你的头going all the way up to the top of your head.每次呼吸 平静加深了And each breath introduces a deeper calm,接受加深了 存在加深了deeper acceptance,deeper being.体验 感受这股轻松感Just experience,just feel the lightness,因接受而带来的轻松the light that comes from acceptance,自然状态下的轻松from our natural state of being.再深吸一口气Take another deep breath in.慢慢地轻轻地呼出来Slow,gentle,quiet exhalation.呼完下口气 睁开你的眼睛And with the next exhalation,open your eyes.如果你旁边的同学睡着了If the person next to you is asleep,again,轻轻地推他们一下 或者抱一下他们just gently nudge them or embrace them.正念冥想 正念疗法The effects of mindfulness meditation,mindfulness therapy-真的能改变我们的思维it's quite literally mind boggling.我们练习这种正念冥想时What we are doing and what mindful therapy does我们的注意力从作为转移到了不作为上is change our focus from doing to being.什么意思?How is that?通常当我们感到有压力时You see usually,usually when we experience something stressful,或者当我们头脑陷入悲伤情绪时or when our mind goes to a sad place,我们第一个反应就是 怎么解决它our immediate reaction is how can I fix it.我怎么解决它?How can I fix it?我们通过想其他办法来解决它And we try to fix it by thinking about alternative,或者想办法让自己好受点or by getting ourselves to feel better,或者分析我们面对的问题by thinking through the problem that we are facing.为什么?因为我们这种解决问题的思维管用Why? Because this fixing mind works.因为有解决问题的思维 我们才有科学I mean because of the fixing mind that we have science,才有技术和进步technology and progress;因为解决问题 分析问题的思维and because of the fixing mind,the thinking mind,你们才考进哈佛that you got in here.你们能考进来不是因为你们是成功的冥想家You didn't get in here because you are a great meditator.你们能考进 是因为你们考试成绩好You got in here because you did well in your tests.你们能解答SAT上的问题You are able to solve problems well on the SATs.这是好事 这是重要的技能And that's a good thing.That's a important skill.但通常它有反作用But very often it's counter-productive尤其是用它来处理思维和心理问题时when it comes to dealing with mental,psychological issues.我们会不由自主应用它 我们想解决问题We gravitate toward it.We want to fix it.但通常会适得其反But very often it's counter-productive.同样会有反作用的Just like it would be counter-productive是我们想干预体内的to try a meddle with the digestion that our bodies go through,消化过程时the digestive process.消化不受我们控制It happens independent of us.如果我们想左右它 看清它 分析它 促进它If we try playing with it,open it,look at it,help it,我们只会伤害它we'll only hurt it.为什么?因为我们体内的主宰 体内的医生Why? Because the internal mind,the internal healer,体内的智慧最擅长处理某些事the internal wisdom knows best to deal with certain things-不是所有事 但是某一些事not everything,but certain things.例如消化 还有通常的 不是所有的Such as digestion.Such as very often,not always,通常的精神问题 痛苦情绪but very often with mental afflictions,with painful emotions.所以我们要把注意力So we are moving,we are shifting our focus从解决这种情绪转移到与它同在from trying to fix to simply be with that emotion,感受这种痛苦的身体反应with that experience,with the manifestation of the pain.在他们的书中 在牛津任职的William说In their book,William who teaches at Oxford:"想消除抑郁是通常的解决办法"Trying to get rid of depression in the usual problem-solving way想解决不对劲的地方 只会让我们陷得更深trying to 'fix' what's 'wrong' with us,just digs us in deeper.1180苦苦思索是问题症结之一 不是解决方法"Rumination is part of the problem,not part of the solution."这里强调苦苦思索Now the emphasis here is on rumination.它并不等同于…我们之前谈过It's not- and we've talked about it at all,它并不等同于写日记 它是没有益处的it's not like if you write in your journal,it's not helpful.把你面对的问题写进日记里It's good for you to write about issues是有益于你的that you are dealing with in your journal.和亲密朋友谈谈 是有益于你的It's good to talk to a very close friend.但如果钻斗角尖But just rumination,一次又一次地思索这个问题going over the same scenario over and over again.苦苦思索它 想解决它 通常会使它恶化Ruminating about it,trying to fix it very often makes it worse.如果我们只是感受这股情绪And we would be better off just going to the emotion,感受身体反应 反而会更好going to the physical manifestation.大家试试 看哪种方法适合自己Try it.See what's right for you.也许适合你的方法是It may be right for you to you know,找个时间写半小时write half an hour on one occasion然后冥想10分钟and then just meditate on it for 10 minutes.也许光是写更适合你Or it may be right for you to only write about it.每个人的方法都不同It's different for different people.我给大家讲这些But what I'm doing here只是希望教会大家另一个心理工具is I'm adding another tool to your psychological tool box.例如我们可以借助认知重建And just like we can cognitively reconstruct,把威胁看成挑战as opposed to seeing it as a threat,to see it as a challenge;把威胁看成荣幸as opposed to seeing it as a threat,to see it as a privilege;把失败as opposed to seeing it as a failure,看成一次学习机会just to see it as a learning opportunity.我们也能情绪重建We can also have emotional reconstruction,不要对情绪苦苦思索where instead of just thinking and ruminating about it,而是去感受它we go to the experience."不再尝试无视和消除身体不适"With the shift trying to ignore or eliminate physical discomfort而是抱着关怀之心去关注它to paying attention with friendly curiosity,我们就能真真正正地改变我们的感受"we can transform- quite literally transform our experience."今天我教大家最后一个方法I'm going to leave you today with a last tip.这个方法很重要And this is something that is very important我非常推荐 你们所有人都要学 没有例外and that I highly recommend doing- for all of you,no exception.我非常推荐的方法是呼吸What I highly recommend doing is breathing.呼吸很重要It's very,very important to breathe.事实上 它是唯一And in fact,it's the one thing所有正念冥想的共通点that's common to all the mindful meditation practices你可以把它应用于生活中and something that you can introduce to your life-当然我所说的呼吸是正确呼吸of course I mean proper breathing.你可以应用到你的生活中Something that you can introduce to your life,即使你没有一天冥想15分钟 或45分钟even if you don't meditate for 15 minutes or 45 minutes a day.我所说的呼吸是深呼吸What I'm talking about here is deep breathing.因为现实情况是Because here is what happens:在现代世界 我们经常感到紧张焦虑in our modern world,we are mostly stressed and anxious.因此我们的呼吸变得很浅As a result of this,our breathing becomes shallow.因为呼吸很浅And as a result of shallow breathing,当我们呼吸浅时when our breathing is shallow,我们就变得更紧张焦虑we become even more stressed and anxious.我们就会陷入一个恶性循环And we go into this vicious cycle,一个"或战或逃反应"的恶性循环vicious downward spiral of the "fight or flight" response.我们平常就是这样处理的And that's how we go through most of our days.庆幸的是我们可以扭转这种循环Fortunately we can reverse this.我们可以马上扭转它And we can reverse this very quickly.因为我们还知道Because we also know that平静和健康促进我们深呼吸calm and well being leads to deep breathing;深呼吸又能反过来促进平静和健康and deep breathing in turn leads to calm and well being.我们可以扭转这种"或战或逃"的反应We can reverse the "fight or flight" response进入Herbert Benson所说的and enter what Herbert Benson calls,放松反应 只需三个深呼吸的时间the relaxation response within as little as three deep breaths.我们可以把这三个深呼吸的方法We can introduce these three deep breaths有计划地应用在一天的生活中strategically throughout the day.上课前 下课后Just before class starts; just when the class ends;早上醒来时just when I wake up in the morning;或者上床睡觉前or the last thing before I go to bed.三个深呼吸Three deep breaths,有计划地按排到一天的时间点上 能改变你的人生strategic points through the day can transform a life.Andrew Weil 我们医学院的毕业生Andrew Weil,graduate of our medical school,现在任职于亚利桑那州大学 在他很棒的CD中now at the University of Arizona,in his wonderful CD,他这样说呼吸talks about breathing:"如果我只能说一条健康生活的建议"If I had to limit my advice on healthier living to just one tip,答案很简单 学习正确呼吸"it would be simply to learn how to breathe correctly."这意味着 像婴儿一样呼吸And that means breathing like a baby breathes.吸进腹部Into the stomach.我说过 这节课不会教什么新知识了I told you,I'm not going to teach you much new in this course.你们都知道怎么呼吸You know how to breathe.你们一出生就知道怎么呼吸You learn how to breathe when you were born.现在我们要做的只是去掉多余的牵绊All we are doing now is chipping away the excess stone求助于你的自然智慧 自然医生so that you go back to your natural wisdom,your natural healer.在一本很棒的书里In a wonderful book,Alia Crum的父亲 她和Ellen Langer写了这篇文章Alia Crum's Dad- she did the article with Ellen Langer-她父亲Thomas Crum提了几个很好的建议Thomas Crum gives some good advice about如何扭转"或逃或战"反应how we can reverse the "flight or fight" response.他的其中一个建议And one of the things that he advises-就是每次遇到红灯he says that each time you get to a red light,把它当作一个深呼吸的机会use it as an opportunity to breathe deeply-不管是走路 还是遇到红灯whether when you are walking and you get to a red light,或者在车里or in the car.以前…我用过这种方法Now in the past...I introduced it.以前每次遇到红灯时 都很烦躁In the past,every time I got to a red light,it was annoying,尤其是刚刚从绿灯转成红灯时especially if the light had just changed from green.现在每次遇到红灯Now whenever I get to a red light,我都把它当作一个机会 深深呼吸it's an opportunity and I breathe deeply.在生活中学会深呼吸Introduce deep breathing to your life.一天几次Just a few times a day.能产生深远影响And that can have far-reaching consequences.我们下周见So I'll see you next week.在此之前 大家深呼吸And until then,breathe.掌声[Applause]
